   COMBINED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (Unaudited)      Note 1. Nature of
Operations     Dominion, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, is one of the nation s largest producers and transporters of energy. Dominion s
operations are conducted through various subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Gas. Virginia Power is a regulated public utility that generates, transmits and distributes electricity for sale in Virginia and northeastern North
Carolina. Dominion Gas is a holding company that conducts business activities through a regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline and underground storage system in the Northeast, mid-Atlantic and Midwest states, regulated gas
transportation and distribution operations in Ohio, and gas gathering and processing activities primarily in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Dominion Gas  principal wholly-owned subsidiaries are DTI, East Ohio and Dominion Iroquois. In
August 2016, DTI transferred its gathering and processing facilities to Dominion Gathering and Processing, Inc., a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion Gas. See Note 3 for a description of operations acquired in the Dominion Questar
Combination.     Note 2. Significant Accounting Policies   
 As permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Companies  accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain certain condensed
financial information and exclude certain footnote disclosures normally included in annual audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction
with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    In the
Companies  opinion, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly their financial position as of September 30, 2016, their results of operations for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, their cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and Dominion s changes in equity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Such adjustments are normal and
recurring in nature unless otherwise noted.    The Companies make certain estimates and assumptions in preparing their Consolidated Financial Statements in
accordance with GAAP. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses for the periods presented. Actual results may differ from those estimates.    The Companies  accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, their accounts, those of their respective majority-owned subsidiaries and non-wholly-owned entities in which they have a controlling financial interest. For certain
partnership structures, income is allocated based on the liquidation value of the underlying contractual arrangements. As of September 30, 2016, Dominion owns the general partner and 65.0% of the limited partner interests in Dominion Midstream.
The public s ownership interest in Dominion Midstream is reflected as noncontrolling interest in Dominion s Consolidated Financial Statements. Also, as of September 30, 2016, Dominion owns 50% of the units in and consolidates Four
Brothers and Three Cedars. SunEdison s ownership interest in Four Brothers and Three Cedars, as well as Terra Nova Renewable Partners  33% interest in certain Dominion merchant solar projects, is reflected as noncontrolling interest in
Dominion s Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 3 for further information on transactions with SunEdison.    The results of operations for
interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year. Information for quarterly periods is affected by seasonal variations in sales, rate changes, electric fuel and other energy-related purchases, purchased gas
expenses and other factors.    Certain amounts in the Companies  2015 Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes have been reclassified to conform to
the 2016 presentation for comparative purposes. The reclassifications did not affect the Companies  net income, total assets, liabilities, equity or cash flows, except for the reclassification of debt issuance costs as discussed in Note 2 to
the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    Amounts disclosed for Dominion are inclusive of Virginia Power
and/or Dominion Gas, where applicable.     Note 3. Acquisitions and Dispositions   
  Dominion       Acquisition of Dominion Questar
     In September 2016, Dominion completed the Dominion Questar Combination and Dominion Questar became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dominion.
Dominion Questar is a Rockies-based integrated natural gas company that operates approximately  
      22  

Table of Contents  

3,400 miles of gas transmission pipeline, 27,500 miles of gas distribution pipeline and 56 bcf of gas storage. Additionally, Dominion Questar develops and produces natural gas from
cost-of-service reserves for its retail distribution customers. The Dominion Questar Combination provides Dominion with pipeline infrastructure that provides a principal source of gas supply to Western states. Dominion Questar s regulated
businesses will also provide further balance between Dominion s electric and gas operations.    In accordance with the terms of the Dominion Questar
Combination, at closing, each share of issued and outstanding Dominion Questar common stock was converted into the right to receive $25.00 per share in cash. The total consideration was $4.4 billion based on 175.5 million shares of Dominion
Questar outstanding at closing.    Dominion financed the Dominion Questar Combination through the: (1) August 2016 issuance of $1.4 billion of 2016
Equity Units, (2) August 2016 issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes, (3) September 2016 borrowing of $1.2 billion under a private placement term loan agreement and (4) $500 million of the proceeds from the April 2016 issuance of
common stock. See Note 14 for more information.     Purchase Price Allocation   
 Dominion Questar s assets acquired and liabilities assumed were measured at estimated fair value at the closing date and are included in the Dominion
Energy operating segment. The majority of Dominion Questar s operations are subject to the rate-setting authority of FERC, the Utah Commission and/or the Wyoming Commission and therefore are accounted for pursuant to ASC 980,  Regulated
Operations . The fair values of Dominion Questar s assets and liabilities subject to rate-setting and cost recovery provisions provide revenues derived from costs, including a return on investment of assets and liabilities included in rate
base. As such, the fair values of these assets and liabilities equal their carrying values. Accordingly, neither the assets and liabilities acquired, nor the pro forma financial information, reflect any adjustments related to these amounts.  
 The fair value of Dominion Questar s assets acquired and liabilities assumed that are not subject to the rate-setting provisions discussed above was
determined using the income approach. In addition, the fair value of Dominion Questar s 50% interest in White River Hub, accounted for under the equity method, was determined using the market approach and income approach. The valuations are
considered Level 3 fair value measurements due to the use of significant judgmental and unobservable inputs, including projected timing and amount of future cash flows and discount rates reflecting risk inherent in the future cash flows and future
market prices.    The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was recognized as goodwill
at the closing date. The goodwill reflects the value associated with enhancing Dominion s regulated portfolio of businesses, including the expected increase in demand for low-carbon, natural gas-fired generation in the Western states and the
expected continued growth of rate-regulated businesses located in a defined service area with a stable regulatory environment. The goodwill recognized is not deductible for income tax purposes, and as such, no deferred taxes have been recorded
related to goodwill.    The table below shows the preliminary allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at closing.
The allocation is subject to change during the remainder of the measurement period, which ends one year from the closing date, as additional information is obtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the closing date. Any material
adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the measurement period will be recognized and disclosed in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  
      23

(1) 
 Includes $40 million for an equity method investment in White River Hub. The fair value adjustment on the equity method investment in White River Hub is considered to be equity method goodwill and is not amortized.

(2) 
 Nonregulated property, plant and equipment, excluding land, will be depreciated over remaining useful lives primarily ranging from 9 to 18 years.    

Regulatory Matters     The transaction
required approval of Dominion Questar s shareholders, clearance from the Federal Trade Commission under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and approval from both the Utah Commission and the Wyoming Commission. In February 2016, the Federal Trade
Commission granted antitrust approval of the Dominion Questar Combination under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. In May 2016, Dominion Questar s shareholders voted to approve the Dominion Questar Combination. In August 2016 and September 2016,
approvals were granted by the Utah Commission and the Wyoming Commission, respectively. Information regarding the transaction was also provided to the Idaho Public Utilities Commission, who acknowledged the Dominion Questar Combination in October
2016, and directed Dominion Questar to notify the Idaho Public Utilities Commission when it makes filings with the Utah Commission.    Approval of the
Dominion Questar Combination in Utah and Wyoming was conditioned upon Dominion agreeing to the following:      

Dominion will contribute $75 million toward the funding of Dominion Questar s qualified and non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans and its other post-employment benefit plans within six months of the closing
date. This contribution is expected to be made during the fourth quarter of 2016.        

Dominion committed to increasing Dominion Questar s historical level of corporate contributions to charities by $1 million per year for at least five years.    

Questar Gas withdrew its general rate case filed in July 2016 with the Utah Commission and agreed to not file a general rate case with the Utah Commission to adjust its base distribution non-gas rates prior to July
2019, unless otherwise ordered by the Utah Commission. In addition, Questar Gas agreed not to file a general rate case with the Wyoming Commission with a requested rate effective date earlier than January 2020. This does not impact Questar
Gas s ability to adjust rates through various riders.       Results of Operations and Pro Forma Information   
 The impact of the Dominion Questar Combination on Dominion s operating revenue and net income attributable to Dominion in the Consolidated Statements of
Income for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was an increase of $23 million and $5 million, respectively.    Dominion incurred
transaction and transition costs, of which $40 million and $47 million was recorded in other operations and maintenance expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $13 million was recorded in interest and
related charges for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, in Dominion s Consolidated Statements of Income. These costs consist of the amortization of financing costs, the charitable contribution commitment described
above, employee-related expenses, professional fees, and other miscellaneous costs.

  The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the consolidated results of operations of
Dominion assuming the Dominion Questar Combination had taken place on January 1, 2015. The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results
of operations that would have been achieved or the future consolidated results of operations of the combined company.      

(1) 
 Amounts include adjustments for non-recurring costs directly related to the Dominion Questar Combination.    
  Anticipated Contribution of Questar Pipeline to Dominion Midstream   
 In October 2016, Dominion entered into the Contribution Agreement under which Dominion will contribute Questar Pipeline to Dominion Midstream. Upon
closing of the agreement, expected by the end of 2016, Dominion Midstream will become owner of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Questar Pipeline in exchange for consideration consisting of Dominion Midstream common and
convertible preferred units with a combined value between $400 million and $725 million and cash between $565 million and $890 million, $300 million of which is considered a debt-financed distribution, for a total of $1.3 billion. In addition,
under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Dominion Midstream will repurchase approximately 6,657,000 common units from Dominion, and will repay its $301 million promissory note to Dominion. The cash proceeds from these transactions will be
utilized to repay the $1.2 billion private placement term loan agreement borrowed in September 2016. Since Dominion consolidates Dominion Midstream for financial reporting purposes, the transactions associated with the Contribution Agreement will be
eliminated upon consolidation and will not impact Dominion s financial position or cash flows.      Non-Wholly-Owned Merchant Solar Projects
      Acquisitions of Four Brothers and Three Cedars   
 In June 2015, Dominion acquired 50% of the units in Four Brothers from SunEdison for $64 million of consideration, consisting of $2 million in cash and a $62
million payable. As of September 30, 2016, a $7 million payable is included in other current liabilities in Dominion s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Four Brothers  purpose is to operate four solar projects located in Utah, which
produce and sell electricity and renewable energy credits. The facilities began commercial operations during the third quarter of 2016, with generating capacity of approximately 320 MW, at a cost of approximately $670 million.  
 In September 2015, Dominion acquired 50% of the units in Three Cedars from SunEdison for $43 million of consideration, consisting of $6 million in cash and a
$37 million payable. As of September 30, 2016, a $4 million payable is included in other current liabilities in Dominion s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Three Cedars  purpose is to operate three solar projects located in Utah, which
produce and sell electricity and renewable energy credits. The facilities began commercial operations during the third quarter of 2016, with generating capacity of approximately 210 MW, at a cost of approximately $450 million.  
 The Four Brothers and Three Cedars facilities operate under long-term power purchase, interconnection and operation and maintenance agreements. Dominion will
claim 99% of the federal investment tax credits on the projects.    Dominion owns 50% of the voting interests in Four Brothers and Three Cedars and has a
controlling financial interest over the entities through its rights to control operations. The allocation of the $64 million purchase price for Four Brothers resulted in $89 million of property, plant and equipment and $25 million of noncontrolling
interest. The allocation of the $43 million purchase price for Three Cedars resulted in $65 million of property, plant and equipment and $22 million of noncontrolling interest. The noncontrolling interest for each entity was measured at fair value
using the discounted cash flow method, with the primary components of the valuation being future cash flows (both incoming and outgoing) and the discount rate. Dominion determined its discount rate based on the cost of capital a utility-scale
investor would expect, as well as the cost of capital an individual project developer could achieve via a combination of non-recourse project financing and outside equity partners. The acquired assets of Four Brothers and Three Cedars are included
in the Dominion Generation operating segment.

  Dominion has assumed the majority of the agreements to provide administrative and support services in connection
with construction of the projects, operations and maintenance of the facilities and technical management services of the solar facilities. Costs related to services to be provided under these agreements were immaterial for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. Subsequent to Dominion s acquisition of Four Brothers and Three Cedars, SunEdison made contributions to Four Brothers and Three Cedars of $281 million in aggregate through September 30, 2016, which are reflected as
noncontrolling interests in Dominion s Consolidated Balance Sheets.    In November 2016, NRG acquired the 50% of units in Four Brothers and Three
Cedars previously held by SunEdison.      Wholly-Owned Merchant Solar Projects    
 The following table presents significant completed acquisitions of wholly-owned merchant solar projects by Dominion in the nine months ended September 30,
2015. Long-term power purchase, interconnection and operation and maintenance agreements have been executed for all of the projects. Dominion has claimed federal investment tax credits on the projects. These projects are included in the Dominion
Generation operating segment.

 The purchase price was primarily allocated to Property, Plant and Equipment.    

(2) 
 Includes acquisition cost.    

(3) 
 One of the projects, Marin Carport, began commercial operations in 2016.      In August 2016, Dominion entered
into an agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interests of two solar projects in California from Solar Frontier Americas Holding, LLC for approximately $128 million in cash. The acquisition is expected to close prior to both projects commencing
operations, which is expected by the end of 2017. The projects are expected to cost approximately $130 million once constructed, including the initial acquisition cost, and to generate approximately 50 MW combined.  
 In August 2016, Dominion entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interests of four solar projects in Virginia from Virginia Solar, LLC. The
acquisition is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2016, prior to the projects commencing operations by the end of 2017, for an amount to be determined based on the costs incurred through closing. The projects are expected to cost
approximately $160 million once constructed, including the initial acquisition cost, and to generate approximately 80 MW combined.    In September 2016,
Dominion entered into an agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interests of a solar project in Virginia from Community Energy Solar, LLC. The acquisition is expected to close during the first quarter of 2017, prior to the project commencing
operations by the end of 2017, for an amount to be determined based on the costs incurred through closing. The project is expected to cost approximately $210 million once constructed, including the initial acquisition cost, and to generate
approximately 100 MW.      Sale of Interest in Merchant Solar Projects    
 In September 2015, Dominion signed an agreement to sell a noncontrolling interest (consisting of 33% of the equity interests) in all of its then currently
wholly-owned merchant solar projects, 24 solar projects totaling approximately 425 MW, to SunEdison, including projects discussed in the table above. In December 2015, the sale of interest in 15 of the solar projects closed for $184 million with the
sale of interest in the remaining projects completed in January 2016 for $117 million. Upon closing, SunEdison sold its interest in these projects to Terra Nova Renewable Partners. Terra Nova Renewable Partners has a future option to buy all or a
portion of Dominion s remaining 67% ownership in the projects upon the occurrence of certain events, none of which had occurred as of September 30, 2016 nor are expected to occur in the remainder of 2016.

    Acquisition of DCG    
 In January 2015, Dominion completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of DCG from SCANA Corporation for $497 million in cash, as adjusted for
working capital. DCG owns and operates nearly 1,500 miles of FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline in South Carolina and southeastern Georgia. This acquisition supports Dominion s natural gas expansion into the Southeast. The
allocation of the purchase price resulted in $277 million of net property, plant and equipment, $250 million of goodwill, of which approximately $225 million is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes, and $38 million of regulatory
liabilities. The goodwill reflects the value associated with enhancing Dominion s regulated gas position, economic value attributable to future expansion projects as well as increased opportunities for synergies. The acquired assets of DCG are
included in the Dominion Energy operating segment.    On March 24, 2015, DCG converted to a limited liability company under the laws of South Carolina
and changed its name from Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation to DCG. On April 1, 2015, Dominion contributed 100% of the issued and outstanding membership interests of DCG to Dominion Midstream in exchange for total consideration of $501
million, as adjusted for working capital. Total consideration to Dominion consisted of the issuance of a two-year, $301 million senior unsecured promissory note payable by Dominion Midstream at an annual interest rate of 0.6%, and 5,112,139 common
units, valued at $200 million, representing limited partner interests in Dominion Midstream. The number of units was based on the volume weighted average trading price of Dominion Midstream s common units for the ten trading days prior to
April 1, 2015, or $39.12 per unit. Since Dominion consolidates Dominion Midstream for financial reporting purposes, this transaction was eliminated upon consolidation and did not impact Dominion s financial position or cash flows.  
  Dominion Gas       Assignments of Shale Development
Rights      In December 2013, Dominion Gas closed on an agreement with a natural gas producer to convey over time approximately 79,000 acres of
Marcellus Shale development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields. The agreement provided for payments to Dominion Gas, subject to customary adjustments, of up to approximately $200 million over a period of nine years, and an
overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. In March 2015, Dominion Gas and the natural gas producer closed on an amendment to the agreement, which included the immediate conveyance of approximately 9,000 acres of Marcellus Shale
development rights and a two year extension of the term of the original agreement. The conveyance of development rights resulted in the recognition of $43 million ($27 million after-tax) of previously deferred revenue to operations and maintenance
expense in Dominion Gas  Consolidated Statements of Income. In April 2016, Dominion Gas and the natural gas producer closed on an amendment to the agreement, which included the immediate conveyance of a 32% partial interest in the remaining
approximately 70,000 acres. This conveyance resulted in the recognition of the remaining $35 million ($21 million after-tax) of previously deferred revenue to operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Gas  Consolidated Statements of
Income.    In March 2015, Dominion Gas conveyed to a natural gas producer approximately 11,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights underneath one of
its natural gas storage fields and received proceeds of $27 million and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. This transaction resulted in a $27 million ($16 million after-tax) gain, included in other operations and
maintenance expense in Dominion Gas  Consolidated Statements of Income.    In September 2015, Dominion Gas closed on an agreement with a natural gas
producer to convey approximately 16,000 acres of Utica and Point Pleasant Shale development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields. The agreement provided for a payment to Dominion Gas, subject to customary adjustments, of $52
million and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. In September 2015, Dominion Gas received proceeds of $52 million associated with the conveyance of the acreage, resulting in a $52 million ($29 million after-tax) gain,
included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Gas  Consolidated Statements of Income.    In November 2014, Dominion Gas closed on an
agreement with a natural gas producer to convey over time approximately 24,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights underneath one of its natural gas storage fields. In connection with that agreement, in January 2016, Dominion Gas conveyed
approximately 2,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights and received proceeds of $5 million and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. This transaction resulted in a $5 million ($3 million after-tax) gain. Also
in connection with that agreement, in July 2016, Dominion Gas conveyed approximately 2,000 acres of Marcellus Shale development rights and received proceeds of $5 million and an overriding royalty interest in gas produced from the acreage. This
transaction resulted in a $5 million ($3 million after-tax) gain. These gains are included in other operations and maintenance expense in Dominion Gas  Consolidated Statements of Income.

 The Companies  operating revenue consists of the following:      
    Note 5. Income Taxes   
 For continuing operations, including noncontrolling interests, the statutory United States federal income tax rate reconciles to the Companies  effective
income tax rate as follows:      
   In 2016, Dominion s effective tax rate reflects $23 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits resulting from a
settlement with a tax authority ($12 million) and a legislative change ($11 million). The settlement is also reflected in Dominion Gas  2016 effective tax rate. Otherwise, as of September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes in
the Companies  unrecognized tax benefits or possible changes that could reasonably be expected to occur during the next twelve months. See Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the

Note 8. Fair Value Measurements   
 The Companies  fair value measurements are made in accordance with the policies discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the
Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 9 in this report for further information about the Companies  derivatives and hedge accounting activities.  
 Dominion and Dominion Gas apply fair value measurements to foreign currency swaps used to manage the foreign currency exchange rate risk related to interest
and principal payments denominated in foreign currencies. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes and are categorized as Level 2.  
      34  

Table of Contents  

  The inputs and assumptions used in measuring the fair value for foreign currency swaps include the following:

Foreign currency forward exchange rates        

Credit quality of counterparties and the Companies        

Notional value        

Credit enhancements        

Time value      The Companies enter into certain physical and financial forwards, futures, options and swaps,
which are considered Level 3 as they have one or more inputs that are not observable and are significant to the valuation. The discounted cash flow method is used to value Level 3 physical and financial forwards and futures contracts. An option
model is used to value Level 3 physical and financial options. The discounted cash flow model for forwards and futures calculates mark-to-market valuations based on forward market prices, original transaction prices, volumes, and risk-free rate of
return. The option model calculates mark-to-market valuations using variations of the Black-Scholes option model. The inputs into the models are the forward market prices, implied price volatilities, risk-free rate of return, the option expiration
dates, the option strike prices, the original sales prices, and volumes. For Level 3 fair value measurements, forward market prices, and implied price volatilities are considered unobservable. The unobservable inputs are developed and substantiated
using historical information, available market data, third-party data, and statistical analysis. Periodically, inputs to valuation models are reviewed and revised as needed, based on historical information, updated market data, market liquidity and
relationships, and changes in third-party pricing sources.    The following table presents Dominion s quantitative information about Level 3 fair value
measurements at September 30, 2016. The range and weighted average are presented in dollars for market price inputs and percentages for price volatility.

  The following table presents the net change in Dominion Gas  assets and liabilities for derivatives measured
at fair value on a recurring basis and included in the Level 3 fair value category:      
   The gains and losses included in earnings in the Level 3 fair value category were classified in operating revenue in Dominion
Gas  Consolidated Statements of Income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. There were no unrealized gains or losses included in earnings in the Level 3 fair value category relating to assets/liabilities still held at the
reporting date for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.     Fair Value of Financial Instruments   
 Substantially all of the Companies  financial instruments are recorded at fair value, with the exception of the instruments described below, which are
reported at historical cost. Estimated fair values have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies considered appropriate by management. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, customer, affiliated, and
other receivables, short-term debt, affiliated current borrowings, payables to affiliates and accounts payable are representative of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For the Companies  financial instruments that
are not recorded at fair value, the carrying amounts and estimated fair values are as follows:      

(1) 
 Fair value is estimated using market prices, where available, and interest rates currently available for issuance of debt with similar terms and remaining maturities. All fair value measurements are classified as Level
2. The carrying amount of debt issues with short-term maturities and variable rates refinanced at current market rates is a reasonable estimate of their fair value.    

(2) 
 Carrying amount includes amounts which represent the unamortized debt issuance costs, discount and/or premium, and foreign currency remeasurement adjustments. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
includes the valuation of certain fair value hedges associated with fixed rate debt of $14 million and $7 million, respectively.    

(3) 
 Carrying amount includes amounts which represent the unamortized debt issuance costs, discount and/or premium.    

(4) 
 Carrying amount includes amounts which represent the unamortized debt issuance costs, discount and/or premium, and foreign currency remeasurement adjustments.    
  Note 9. Derivatives and Hedge Accounting Activities   
 The Companies  accounting policies, objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments are discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 8 in this report for further information about fair value measurements and associated valuation methods for derivatives.  
 Derivative assets and liabilities are presented gross on the Companies  Consolidated Balance Sheets. Dominion s derivative contracts include both
over-the-counter transactions and those that are executed on an exchange or other trading platform (exchange contracts) and centrally cleared. Dominion Gas  and Virginia Power s derivative contracts consist of over-the-counter
 
      41  

Table of Contents  

transactions. Over-the-counter contracts are bilateral contracts that are transacted directly with a counterparty. Exchange contracts utilize a financial intermediary, exchange, or
clearinghouse to enter, execute, or clear the transactions. Certain over-the-counter and exchange contracts contain contractual rights of setoff through master netting arrangements, derivative clearing agreements, and contract default provisions. In
addition, the contracts are subject to conditional rights of setoff through counterparty nonperformance, insolvency, or other conditions.    In general,
most over-the-counter transactions and all exchange contracts are subject to collateral requirements. Types of collateral for over-the-counter and exchange contracts include cash, letters of credit, and in some cases other forms of security, none of
which are subject to restrictions. Cash collateral is used in the table below to offset derivative assets and liabilities. Certain accounts receivable and accounts payable recognized on the Companies  Consolidated Balance Sheets, as well as
letters of credit and other forms of security, all of which are not included in the tables below, are subject to offset under master netting or similar arrangements and would reduce the net exposure.

 Maturity is determined based on final settlement period.    
     Ineffectiveness and AOCI    
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, gains or losses on hedging instruments determined to be ineffective and amounts excluded
from the assessment of effectiveness were not material. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness include gains or losses attributable to changes in the time value of options and changes in the differences between spot prices and forward
prices.

  The following table presents selected information related to gains (losses) on cash flow hedges included in AOCI
in Dominion s Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2016:      
   The amounts that will be reclassified from AOCI to earnings will generally be offset by the recognition of the hedged
transactions (e.g., anticipated sales) in earnings, thereby achieving the realization of prices contemplated by the underlying risk management strategies and will vary from the expected amounts presented above as a result of changes in market
prices, interest rates, and foreign currency exchange rates.

additional 3% membership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline from Duke for $14 million, which adjusted Dominion s and Duke s membership interest to 48% and 47%, respectively.  
   Dominion Gas       Iroquois   
 Dominion Gas  equity earnings totaled $14 million and $17 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Dominion Gas
received distributions from this investment of $17 million and $26 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying amount of Dominion Gas 
investment of $97 million and $102 million, respectively, exceeded its share of underlying equity in net assets by $8 million. The difference reflects equity method goodwill and is not being amortized. In May 2016, Dominion Gas sold 0.65% of the
non-controlling partnership interest in Iroquois to TransCanada for approximately $7 million, which resulted in a $5 million ($3 million after-tax) gain, included in other income in Dominion Gas  Consolidated Statements of Income.

  Note 12. Regulatory Matters      Regulatory Matters
Involving Potential Loss Contingencies     As a result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, the Companies are involved in various
regulatory matters. Certain regulatory matters may ultimately result in a loss; however, as such matters are in an initial procedural phase, involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending reviews or orders, and/or involve significant factual
issues that need to be resolved, it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a range of possible loss. For matters for which the Companies cannot estimate a range of possible loss, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the
matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the regulatory process such that the Companies are able to estimate a range of possible loss. For regulatory matters for which the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of
possible losses, an estimated range of possible loss is provided, in excess of the accrued liability (if any) for such matters. Any estimated range is based on currently available information, involves elements of judgment and significant
uncertainties and may not represent the Companies  maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such regulatory matters will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current
matters not specifically reported below, management does not anticipate that the outcome from such matters would have a material effect on the Companies  financial position, liquidity or results of operations.  
   FERC - Electric      Under the Federal Power Act, FERC
regulates wholesale sales and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce by public utilities. Dominion s merchant generators sell electricity in the PJM, MISO, CAISO and ISO-NE wholesale markets, and to wholesale purchasers in the
states of Tennessee, Georgia, California and Utah, under Dominion s market-based sales tariffs authorized by FERC. Virginia Power purchases and, under its FERC market-based rate authority, sells electricity in the
 
      62  

Table of Contents  

wholesale market. In addition, Virginia Power has FERC approval of a tariff to sell wholesale power at capped rates based on its embedded cost of generation. This cost-based sales tariff could be
used to sell to loads within or outside Virginia Power s service territory. Any such sales would be voluntary.     Rates   
 In April 2008, FERC granted an application for Virginia Power s electric transmission operations to establish a forward-looking formula rate mechanism
that updates transmission rates on an annual basis and approved an ROE of 11.4%, effective as of January 1, 2008. The formula rate is designed to recover the expected revenue requirement for each calendar year and is updated based on actual
costs. The FERC-approved formula method, which is based on projected costs, allows Virginia Power to earn a current return on its growing investment in electric transmission infrastructure.  
 In March 2010, Old Dominion Electric Cooperative and North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation filed a complaint with FERC against Virginia Power
claiming, among other issues, that the incremental costs of undergrounding certain transmission line projects were unjust, unreasonable and unduly discriminatory or preferential and should be excluded from Virginia Power s transmission formula
rate. A settlement of the other issues raised in the complaint was approved by FERC in May 2012.    In March 2014, FERC issued an order excluding from
Virginia Power s transmission rates for wholesale transmission customers located outside Virginia the incremental costs of undergrounding certain transmission line projects. FERC found it is not just and reasonable for non-Virginia wholesale
transmission customers to be allocated the incremental costs of undergrounding the facilities because the projects are a direct result of Virginia legislation and Virginia Commission pilot programs intended to benefit the citizens of Virginia. The
order is retroactively effective as of March 2010 and will cause the reallocation of the costs charged to wholesale transmission customers with loads outside Virginia to wholesale transmission customers with loads in Virginia. FERC determined
that there was not sufficient evidence on the record to determine the magnitude of the underground increment and held a hearing to determine the appropriate amount of undergrounding cost to be allocated to each wholesale transmission customer in
Virginia. While Virginia Power cannot predict the outcome of the hearing, it is not expected to have a material effect on results of operations.     PJM
Transmission Rates     In April 2007, FERC issued an order regarding its transmission rate design for the allocation of costs among PJM transmission
customers, including Virginia Power, for transmission service provided by PJM. For new PJM-planned transmission facilities that operate at or above 500 kV, FERC established a PJM regional rate design where customers pay according to each
customer s share of the region s load. For recovery of costs of existing facilities, FERC approved the existing methodology whereby a customer pays the cost of facilities located in the same zone as the customer. A number of parties
appealed the order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.    In August 2009, the court issued its decision affirming the FERC order
with regard to the existing facilities, but remanded to FERC the issue of the cost allocation associated with the new facilities 500 kV and above for further consideration by FERC. On remand, FERC reaffirmed its earlier decision to allocate the
costs of new facilities 500 kV and above according to the customer s share of the region s load. A number of parties filed appeals of the order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. In June 2014, the court again
remanded the cost allocation issue to FERC. In December 2014, FERC issued an order setting an evidentiary hearing and settlement proceeding regarding the cost allocation issue. The hearing only concerns the costs of new facilities approved by PJM
prior to February 1, 2013. Transmission facilities approved after February 1, 2013 are allocated on a hybrid cost allocation method approved by FERC and not subject to any court review.  
 In June 2016, PJM, the PJM transmission owners and state commissions representing substantially all of the load in the PJM market submitted a settlement to
FERC to resolve the outstanding issues regarding this matter. Under the terms of the settlement, Virginia Power would be required to pay approximately $200 million to PJM over the next 10 years. Although the settlement agreement has not been
accepted by FERC, and the settlement is opposed by a small group of parties to the proceeding, Virginia Power believes it is probable it will be required to make payment as an outcome of the settlement. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016,
Virginia Power has recorded a contingent liability of $200 million in other deferred credits and other liabilities, which is offset by a $192 million regulatory asset for the amount that will be recovered through retail rates in Virginia. The
remaining $8 million was recorded in other operations and maintenance expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
  Other Regulatory Matters     Other than the following
matters, there have been no significant developments regarding the pending regulatory matters disclosed in Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies  Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.

    Virginia Regulation    
   Virginia Fuel Expenses      In May 2016, Virginia Power
submitted its annual fuel factor to the Virginia Commission to recover an estimated $1.4 billion in Virginia jurisdictional projected fuel expenses for the rate year beginning July 1, 2016. Virginia Power s proposed fuel rate represents a
fuel revenue decrease of $286 million when applied to projected kilowatt-hour sales for the period July 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017. In October 2016, the Virginia Commission approved Virginia Power s proposed fuel rate. 
   Rate Adjustment Clauses      Below is a discussion of
significant riders associated with various Virginia Power projects:      

The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider BW in conjunction with Brunswick County. In October 2016, Virginia Power proposed a $134 million revenue requirement for the rate year beginning September 1, 2017,
which represents a $14 million increase over the previous year. This case is pending.        

The Virginia Commission previously approved Rider US-2 in conjunction with the Scott Solar, Whitehouse, and Woodland solar facilities. In October 2016, Virginia Power proposed a $10 million revenue requirement for the
rate year beginning September 1, 2017, which represents a $6 million increase over the previous year. This case is pending.        

The Virginia Commission previously approved Riders C1A and C2A in connection with cost recovery for DSM programs. In October 2016, Virginia Power proposed a total revenue requirement of $45 million for the rate
year beginning July 1, 2017. Virginia Power also proposed two new energy efficiency programs for Virginia Commission approval with a requested five-year cost cap of $178 million for those programs. Virginia Power further proposed to extend
an existing energy efficiency program for an additional two years under current funding, and an existing peak shaving program for an additional five years with an additional $5 million cost cap. This case is pending.    

Virginia Power previously filed for Virginia Commission approval of a revised Rider U in conjunction with cost recovery to move certain electric distribution facilities underground as authorized by prior Virginia
legislation. In August 2016, the Virginia Commission approved a net $20 million revenue requirement and a 9.6% ROE for the rate year beginning September 1, 2016, and an additional $2 million in credits for each of the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019
rate years. The order limited the total investment in Phase One of Virginia Power s proposed program to $140 million, with $123 million recoverable through Rider U.    
   Electric Transmission Project      Virginia Power
previously filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to construct and operate in Loudoun County, Virginia, a new approximately 230 kV Poland Road substation, and a new approximately four mile overhead 230 kV double circuit
transmission line between the existing 230 kV Loudoun-Brambleton line and the Poland Road substation. In August 2016, the Virginia Commission granted a CPCN to construct and operate the project along a revised route.  
   North Anna      Virginia Power is considering the
construction of a third nuclear unit at a site located at North Anna nuclear power station. If Virginia Power decides to build a new unit, it must first receive a COL from the NRC, approval of the Virginia Commission and certain environmental
permits and other approvals. The COL is expected in 2017. Virginia Power has not yet committed to building a new nuclear unit at North Anna nuclear power station.  
 Requests by BREDL for a contested NRC hearing on Virginia Power s COL application have been dismissed, and in September 2016, the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia dismissed with prejudice petitions for judicial review that BREDL and other organizations had filed challenging the NRC s reliance on a rule generically assessing the environmental impacts of continued
onsite storage of spent nuclear fuel in various licensing proceedings, including Virginia Power s COL proceeding. This dismissal followed the Court s June 2016 decision in  New York v. NRC , upholding the NRC s continued storage
rule and August 2016 denial of requests for rehearing en banc. Therefore, the contested portion of the COL proceeding is closed. The NRC is required to conduct a hearing in all COL proceedings. This mandatory NRC hearing will be uncontested.  
 In August 2016, Virginia Power received a 60-day notice of intent to sue from the Sierra Club alleging Endangered Species Act violations. The notice alleges
that the United States Army Corps of Engineers failed to conduct adequate environmental and consultation reviews, related to a potential third nuclear unit located at North Anna, prior to issuing a CWA section 404 permit to Virginia Power in
September 2011. Virginia Power is currently unable to make an estimate of the potential impacts to its consolidated financial statements related to this matter.

    North Carolina Regulation    
 In March 2016, Virginia Power filed its base rate case and schedules with the North Carolina Commission. Virginia Power proposed a non-fuel, base rate increase
of $51 million effective November 1, 2016 with an ROE of 10.5%. In October 2016, Virginia Power entered into a stipulation and settlement agreement for a non-fuel, base rate increase of $35 million with an ROE of 9.9% effective November 1,
2016, on a temporary basis subject to refund, with any permanent rates ordered by the North Carolina Commission effective January 1, 2017. This case is pending.  
 In August 2016, Virginia Power submitted its annual filing to the North Carolina Commission to adjust the fuel component of its electric rates. Virginia Power
proposed a total $36 million decrease to the fuel component of its electric rates for the rate year beginning January 1, 2017. This case is pending.  
   Ohio Regulation       PIR   
 In 2008, East Ohio began PIR, aimed at replacing approximately 25% of its pipeline system. In March 2015, East Ohio filed an application with the Ohio
Commission requesting approval to extend the PIR program for an additional five years and to increase the annual capital investment, with corresponding increases in the annual rate-increase caps. In September 2016, the Ohio Commission approved a
stipulation filed jointly by East Ohio and the Staff of the Ohio Commission to settle East Ohio s pending application. As requested, the PIR Program and associated cost recovery will continue for another five-year term, calendar years 2017
through 2021, and East Ohio will be permitted to increase its annual capital expenditures to $200 million by 2018 and 3% per year thereafter subject to the cost recovery rate increase caps proposed by East Ohio. Costs associated with calendar
year 2016 investment will be recovered under the existing terms.     PSMP   
 In November 2016, the Ohio Commission approved East Ohio s request to defer the operation and maintenance costs associated with implementing PSMP of up to
$15 million per year.      West Virginia Regulation    
 In May 2016, Hope filed a PREP application with the West Virginia Commission requesting approval of a projected capital investment for 2017 of $27 million as
part of a total five-year projected capital investment of $152 million. In September 2016, Hope reached a settlement with all parties to the case agreeing to new PREP customer rates, for the year beginning November 1, 2016, that provide for
projected revenue of $2 million related to capital investments of $20 million and $27 million for 2016 and 2017, respectively. In October 2016, the West Virginia Commission approved the settlement.  
   FERC - Gas      In August 2016, Dominion Gas received
FERC authorization to construct and operate the Leidy South Project facilities. Service under the 20-year contracts is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2017. The project is expected to cost approximately $210 million and provide 155,000
Dths per day of firm transportation service from Clinton County, Pennsylvania to Loudoun County, Virginia.     Note 13. Variable Interest Entities
    The primary beneficiary of a VIE is required to consolidate the VIE and to disclose certain information about its significant variable interests in
the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the entity that has both: 1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the
entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE.     Dominion   
 As of September 30, 2016, Dominion owns the general partner interest and 65.0% of the limited partnership interests in Dominion Midstream, which owns a
preferred equity interest and the general partner interest in Cove Point. Additionally, Dominion owns the manager and 67% of the membership interest in certain merchant solar facilities, as discussed in Note 2. Dominion has concluded that these
entities are VIEs due to the limited partners or members lacking the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Dominion is the primary beneficiary of Dominion Midstream and the merchant solar facilities, and Dominion Midstream is the
primary beneficiary of Cove Point, as they have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance as well as the obligation to absorb losses and benefits which could be significant to them.  
 Dominion owns a 48% membership interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Atlantic Coast Pipeline is focused on constructing an approximately 600-mile natural gas
pipeline running from West Virginia through Virginia to North Carolina, which is expected to be in service in the second half of 2019. See Note 9 to the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
 
      65  

Table of Contents  

December 31, 2015 for more details regarding the nature of this entity. Dominion concluded that Atlantic Coast Pipeline is a VIE because it has insufficient equity to finance its activities
without additional subordinated financial support. Dominion has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary of Atlantic Coast Pipeline as it does not have the power to direct the activities of Atlantic Coast Pipeline that most significantly
impact its economic performance, as the power to direct is shared among multiple unrelated parties. Dominion is obligated to provide capital contributions based on its ownership percentage. Dominion s maximum exposure to loss is limited to its
current and future investment.     Dominion and Virginia Power   
 Dominion and Virginia Power s nuclear decommissioning trust funds and Dominion s rabbi trusts hold investments in limited partnerships or similar
type entities (see Note 10 for further details). Dominion and Virginia Power concluded that these partnership investments are VIEs due to the limited partners lacking the characteristics of a controlling financial interest. Dominion and Virginia
Power have concluded neither is the primary beneficiary as they do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact these VIEs  economic performance. Dominion and Virginia Power are obligated to provide capital
contributions to the partnerships as required by each partnership agreement based on their ownership percentages. Dominion and Virginia Power s maximum exposure to loss is limited to their current and future investments.  
  Dominion and Dominion Gas     Dominion previously concluded
that Iroquois was a VIE because a non-affiliated Iroquois equity holder had the ability during a limited period of time to transfer its ownership interests to another Iroquois equity holder or its affiliate. At the end of the first quarter of 2016,
such right no longer existed and, as a result, Dominion concluded that Iroquois is no longer a VIE.     Virginia Power   
 Virginia Power had long-term power and capacity contracts with five non-utility generators; however, contracts with two of these generators expired in 2015,
leaving three non-utility generators with an aggregate summer generation capacity of approximately 418 MW. These contracts contain certain variable pricing mechanisms in the form of partial fuel reimbursement that Virginia Power considers to be
variable interests. After an evaluation of the information provided by these entities, Virginia Power was unable to determine whether they were VIEs. However, the information they provided, as well as Virginia Power s knowledge of generation
facilities in Virginia, enabled Virginia Power to conclude that, if they were VIEs, it would not be the primary beneficiary. This conclusion reflects Virginia Power s determination that its variable interests do not convey the power to direct
the most significant activities that impact the economic performance of the entities during the remaining terms of Virginia Power s contracts and for the years the entities are expected to operate after its contractual relationships expire. The
contracts expire at various dates ranging from 2017 to 2021. Virginia Power is not subject to any risk of loss from these potential VIEs other than its remaining purchase commitments which totaled $320 million as of September 30, 2016. Virginia
Power paid $37 million and $52 million for electric capacity and $11 million and $17 million for electric energy to these entities in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Virginia Power paid $111 million and $160
million for electric capacity and $23 million and $77 million for electric energy to these entities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
  Dominion Gas     DTI has been engaged to oversee the
construction of, and to subsequently operate and maintain, the projects undertaken by Atlantic Coast Pipeline based on the overall direction and oversight of Atlantic Coast Pipeline s members. An affiliate of DTI holds a membership interest in
Atlantic Coast Pipeline, therefore DTI is considered to have a variable interest in Atlantic Coast Pipeline. The members of Atlantic Coast Pipeline hold the power to direct the construction, operations and maintenance activities of the entity. DTI
has concluded it is not the primary beneficiary of Atlantic Coast Pipeline as it does not have the power to direct the activities of Atlantic Coast Pipeline that most significantly impact its economic performance. DTI has no obligation to absorb any
losses of the VIE. See Note 17 for information about associated related party receivable balances.     Virginia Power and Dominion Gas   
 Virginia Power and Dominion Gas purchased shared services from DRS, an affiliated VIE, of $80 million and $31 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, $73 million and $27 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, $268 million and $95 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $239 million and $85 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, respectively. Virginia Power and Dominion Gas determined that neither is the primary beneficiary of DRS as neither has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well
as the obligation to absorb losses and benefits which could be significant to it. DRS provides accounting, legal, finance and certain administrative and technical services to all Dominion subsidiaries, including Virginia Power and Dominion Gas.
Virginia Power and Dominion Gas have no obligation to absorb more than their allocated shares of DRS costs.

   Note 14. Significant Financing Transactions   
  Credit Facilities and Short-term Debt     The Companies use
short-term debt to fund working capital requirements and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly during the course of the year, depending upon the timing and amount of cash requirements not satisfied
by cash from operations. In addition, Dominion utilizes cash and letters of credit to fund collateral requirements. Collateral requirements are impacted by commodity prices, hedging levels, Dominion s credit ratings and the credit quality of
its counterparties.      Dominion      At
September 30, 2016, Dominion s commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding, as well as its capacity available under credit facilities, were as follows:      

(1) 
 In May 2016, the maturity dates for these facilities were extended from April 2019 to April 2020. These credit facilities can be used by the Companies to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as
well as to support up to a combined $2.0 billion of letters of credit.    

(2) 
 These Dominion Questar facilities were terminated in October 2016.        Virginia Power    
 Virginia Power s short-term financing is supported through its access as co-borrower to the two joint revolving credit facilities. These credit facilities
can be used for working capital, as support for the combined commercial paper programs of the Companies and for other general corporate purposes.    At
September 30, 2016, Virginia Power s share of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding under its joint credit facilities with Dominion and Dominion Gas, were as follows:  

(1) 
 The full amount of the facilities is available to Virginia Power, less any amounts outstanding to co-borrowers Dominion and Dominion Gas. Sub-limits for Virginia Power are set within the facility limit but can be
changed at the option of the Companies multiple times per year. At September 30, 2016, the aggregate sub-limit for Virginia Power was $2.0 billion. If Virginia Power has liquidity needs in excess of its sub-limit, the sub-limit may be changed
or such needs may be satisfied through short-term intercompany borrowings from Dominion. In May 2016, the maturity dates for these facilities were extended from April 2019 to April 2020. These credit facilities can be used to support bank borrowings
and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to $2.0 billion (or the sub-limit, whichever is less) of letters of credit.    
 In addition to the credit facility commitments mentioned above, Virginia Power also has a $120 million credit facility. In May 2016, the maturity date for
this facility was extended from April 2019 to April 2020. As of September 30, 2016, this facility supports $100 million of certain variable rate tax-exempt financings of Virginia Power. In October 2016, this facility was reduced from $120
million to $100 million.      Dominion Gas    
 Dominion Gas  short-term financing is supported by its access as co-borrower to the two joint revolving credit facilities. These credit facilities can be
used for working capital, as support for the combined commercial paper programs of the Companies and for other general corporate purposes.  
      67  

Table of Contents  

  At September 30, 2016, Dominion Gas  share of commercial paper and letters of credit outstanding under
its joint credit facilities with Dominion and Virginia Power were as follows:      

(1) 
 A maximum of a combined $1.5 billion of the facilities is available to Dominion Gas, assuming adequate capacity is available after giving effect to uses by co-borrowers Dominion and Virginia Power. Sub-limits for
Dominion Gas are set within the facility limit but can be changed at the option of the Companies multiple times per year. In September 2016, the aggregate sub-limit for Dominion Gas was decreased from $1.0 billion to $750 million. If Dominion Gas
has liquidity needs in excess of its sub-limit, the sub-limit may be changed or such needs may be satisfied through short-term intercompany borrowings from Dominion. In May 2016, the maturity dates for these facilities were extended from April 2019
to April 2020. These credit facilities can be used to support bank borrowings and the issuance of commercial paper, as well as to support up to $1.5 billion (or the sub-limit, whichever is less) of letters of credit.    
  Remarketable Subordinated Notes     In March 2016 and May
2016, Dominion successfully remarketed the $550 million 2013 Series A 1.07% RSNs due 2021 and the $550 million 2013 Series B 1.18% RSNs due 2019, respectively, pursuant to the terms of the related 2013 Equity Units. In connection with the
remarketings, the interest rate on the Series A and Series B junior subordinated notes was reset to 4.104% and 2.962%, respectively, payable on a semi-annual basis and Dominion ceased to have the ability to redeem the notes at its option or defer
interest payments. At September 30, 2016, the securities are included in junior subordinated notes in Dominion s Consolidated Balance Sheets. Dominion did not receive any proceeds from the remarketings. Remarketing proceeds
belonged to the investors holding the related 2013 Equity Units and were temporarily used to purchase a portfolio of treasury securities. Upon maturity of each portfolio, the proceeds were applied on behalf of investors on the related stock
purchase contract settlement date to pay the purchase price to Dominion for issuance of 8.5 million shares of its common stock on both April 1, 2016 and July 1, 2016. See Issuance of Common Stock below for a description of common
stock issued by Dominion in April 2016 and July 2016 under the stock purchase contracts.    In August 2016, Dominion issued $1.4 billion of 2016 Equity
Units, initially in the form of 2016 Series A Corporate Units. The Corporate Units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol DCUD. The net proceeds were used to finance the Dominion Questar Combination. See Note 3 for more information.  
 Each 2016 Series A Corporate Unit consists of a stock purchase contract, a 1/40 interest in a 2016 Series A-1 RSN issued by Dominion and a 1/40 interest in a
2016 Series A-2 RSN issued by Dominion. The stock purchase contracts obligate the holders to purchase shares of Dominion common stock at a future settlement date prior to the relevant RSN maturity date. The purchase price to be paid under the stock
purchase contracts is $50 per Corporate Unit and the number of shares to be purchased will be determined under a formula based upon the average closing price of Dominion common stock near the settlement date. The RSNs are pledged as collateral to
secure the purchase of common stock under the related stock purchase contracts.    Dominion makes quarterly interest payments on the RSNs and quarterly
contract adjustment payments on the stock purchase contracts, at the rates described below. Dominion may defer payments on the stock purchase contracts and the RSNs for one or more consecutive periods but generally not beyond the purchase contract
settlement date. If payments are deferred, Dominion may not make any cash distributions related to its capital stock, including dividends, redemptions, repurchases, liquidation payments or guarantee payments. Also, during the deferral period,
Dominion may not make any payments on or redeem or repurchase any debt securities that are equal in right of payment with, or subordinated to, the RSNs.  
 Dominion has recorded the present value of the stock purchase contract payments as a liability offset by a charge to equity. Interest payments on the RSNs are
recorded as interest expense and stock purchase contract payments are charged against the liability. Accretion of the stock purchase contract liability is recorded as imputed interest expense. In calculating diluted EPS, Dominion applies the
treasury stock method to the 2016 Equity Units. These securities did not have an effect on diluted EPS for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Under the terms of the stock purchase contracts, assuming no anti-dilution or other adjustments, Dominion will issue between 15.0 million and
18.7 million shares of its common stock in August 2019. A total of 23.1 million shares of Dominion s common stock has been reserved for issuance in connection with the stock purchase contracts.

  Enhanced Junior Subordinated Notes     In the first quarter
of 2016, Dominion purchased and cancelled $38 million and $4 million of the June 2006 hybrids and the September 2006 hybrids, respectively.    In July 2016,
Dominion launched a tender offer to purchase up to $200 million in aggregate of additional June 2006 hybrids and September 2006 hybrids, which expired on August 1, 2016. In connection with the tender offer, Dominion purchased and cancelled
$125 million and $74 million of the June 2006 hybrids and the September 2006 hybrids, respectively. All purchases were conducted in compliance with the applicable replacement capital covenants. Also in July 2016, Dominion issued $800 million of
5.25% July 2016 hybrids. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to finance the tender offer. The July 2016 hybrids are listed on the NYSE under the symbol DRUA.  
 From time to time, Dominion may reduce its outstanding debt and level of interest expense through redemption of debt securities prior to maturity and
repurchases in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, through additional tender offers or otherwise.     Long-term Debt   
 In May 2016, Dominion Gas issued $150 million of private placement 3.8% senior notes that mature in 2031. In June 2016, Dominion Gas issued $250 million of
private placement 2.875% senior notes that mature in 2023. Also in June 2016, Dominion Gas issued  250 million of private placement 1.45% senior notes that mature in 2026. The notes were recorded at $280 million at issuance and included in
long-term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at $281 million at September 30, 2016.    In August 2016, Dominion issued $500 million of 1.60%
senior notes, $400 million of 2.0% senior notes and $400 million of 2.85% senior notes that mature in 2019, 2021 and 2026, respectively. The net proceeds were used to finance the Dominion Questar Combination. See Note 3 for more information.  
 In September 2016, Dominion issued $300 million of private placement 1.50% senior notes that mature in 2018.  
  Short-term Notes     In September 2016, Dominion borrowed
$1.2 billion under a private placement term loan agreement that matures in September 2017 and bears interest at a variable rate. The net proceeds were used to finance the Dominion Questar Combination. See Note 3 for more information. In November
2016, Dominion Midstream completed the issuance and public offering of common units for net proceeds of $348 million. Accordingly, $348 million of the borrowings under the private placement term loan are included in long-term debt in Dominion s
Consolidated Balance Sheets.     Issuance of Common Stock   
 Dominion maintains Dominion Direct    and a number of employee savings plans through which contributions
may be invested in Dominion s common stock. These shares may either be newly issued or purchased on the open market with proceeds contributed to these plans.  
 In December 2014, Dominion filed an SEC shelf registration for the sale of debt and equity securities including the ability to sell common stock through an
at-the-market program. Also in December 2014, Dominion entered into four separate sales agency agreements to effect sales under the program and pursuant to which it may offer from time to time up to $500 million aggregate amount of its common stock.
Sales of common stock can be made by means of privately negotiated transactions, as transactions on the NYSE at market prices or in such other transactions as are agreed upon by Dominion and the sales agents and in conformance with applicable
securities laws. Following issuances during the first and second quarters of 2015, Dominion has the ability to issue up to approximately $200 million of stock under the 2014 sales agency agreements; however, no additional issuances have occurred
under these agreements in 2016.

  In both April 2016 and July 2016, Dominion issued 8.5 million shares under the related stock purchase
contract entered into as part of Dominion s 2013 Equity Units. Additionally, Dominion completed a market issuance of equity in April 2016 of 10.2 million shares and received proceeds of $756 million through a registered underwritten public
offering. A portion of the net proceeds was used to finance the Dominion Questar Combination. See Note 3 for more information.     Note
15. Commitments and Contingencies     As a result of issues generated in the ordinary course of business, the Companies are involved in legal
proceedings before various courts and are periodically subject to governmental examinations (including by regulatory authorities), inquiries and investigations. Certain legal proceedings and governmental examinations involve demands for unspecified
amounts of damages, are in an initial procedural phase, involve uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, or involve significant factual issues that need to be resolved, such that it is not possible for the Companies to estimate a
range of possible loss. For such matters for which the Companies cannot estimate a range of possible loss, a statement to this effect is made in the description of the matter. Other matters may have progressed sufficiently through the litigation or
investigative processes such that the Companies are able to estimate a range of possible loss. For legal proceedings and governmental examinations for which the Companies are able to reasonably estimate a range of possible losses, an estimated range
of possible loss is provided, in excess of the accrued liability (if any) for such matters. Any accrued liability is recorded on a gross basis with a receivable also recorded for any probable insurance recoveries. Estimated ranges of loss are
inclusive of legal fees and net of any anticipated insurance recoveries. Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties. Any estimated range of possible loss may not
represent the Companies  maximum possible loss exposure. The circumstances of such legal proceedings and governmental examinations will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. For current
proceedings not specifically reported below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on the financial position, liquidity or results of operations of the Companies.  
  Environmental Matters     The Companies are subject to costs
resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating
and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations.      Air    
  CAA     The CAA, as amended, is a comprehensive program
utilizing a broad range of regulatory tools to protect and preserve the nation s air quality. At a minimum, states are required to establish regulatory programs to address all requirements of the CAA. However, states may choose to develop
regulatory programs that are more restrictive. Many of the Companies  facilities are subject to the CAA s permitting and other requirements.  
  MATS     In December 2011, the EPA issued MATS for
coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units. The rule establishes strict emission limits for mercury, particulate matter as a surrogate for toxic metals and hydrogen chloride as a surrogate for acid gases. The rule includes a limited
use provision for oil-fired units with annual capacity factors under 8% that provides an exemption from emission limits, and allows compliance with operational work practice standards. Compliance was required by April 16, 2015, with certain
limited exceptions. However, in June 2014, the VDEQ granted a one-year MATS compliance extension for two coal-fired units at Yorktown power station to defer planned retirements and allow for continued operation of the units to address reliability
concerns while necessary electric transmission upgrades are being completed. These coal units will need to continue operating until at least April 2017 due to delays in transmission upgrades needed to maintain electric reliability. Therefore, in
October 2015, Virginia Power submitted a request to the EPA for an additional one year compliance extension under an EPA Administrative Order. The order was signed by the EPA in April 2016 allowing the Yorktown power station units to operate for up
to one additional year, as required to maintain reliable power availability while transmission upgrades are being made.    In June 2015, the United States
Supreme Court issued a decision holding that the EPA failed to take cost into account when the agency first decided to regulate the emissions from coal- and oil-fired plants, and remanded the MATS rule back to the United States Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit. However, the Supreme Court did not vacate or stay the effective date and implementation of the MATS rule. In November 2015, in response to the Supreme Court decision, the EPA proposed a supplemental finding that
consideration of cost does not alter the agency s previous conclusion that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units under Section 112 of the CAA. In December 2015, the District
of Columbia Court of Appeals issued an order remanding the MATS rulemaking proceeding back to the EPA without setting aside judgment, noting that EPA had represented it was on track to issue a final finding regarding its consideration of cost. In
April 2016, the EPA issued a final supplemental finding that consideration of costs does not alter its  
      70

conclusion regarding appropriateness and necessity for the regulation. These actions do not change Virginia Power s plans to close coal units at Yorktown power station by April 2017 or the
need to complete necessary electricity transmission upgrades which are expected to be in service approximately 20 months following receipt of all required permits and approvals for construction. Since the MATS rule remains in effect and Dominion is
complying with the requirements of the rule, Dominion does not expect any adverse impacts to its operations at this time.     CAIR   
 The EPA established CAIR with the intent to require significant reductions in SO 2  and NO X  emissions from electric generating facilities. In July 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a ruling vacating CAIR. In December 2008, the Court
denied rehearing, but also issued a decision to remand CAIR to the EPA. In July 2011, the EPA issued a replacement rule for CAIR, called CSAPR, that required 28 states to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines. CSAPR established new SO 2  and NO X  emissions cap and trade programs that were completely independent of the current ARP. Specifically, CSAPR required reductions in SO 2  and NO X  emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units of 25 MW or more through annual NO X  emissions caps, NO X  emissions caps during the ozone season (May 1 through September 30) and annual SO 2  emission caps with differing requirements for two groups of affected states.     CSAPR   
 Following numerous petitions by industry participants for review and a successful motion for stay, in October 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit ordered that the EPA s motion to lift the stay of CSAPR be granted. Further, the Court granted the EPA s request to shift the CSAPR compliance deadlines by three years, so that Phase 1 emissions budgets (which
would have gone into effect in 2012 and 2013) applied in 2015 and 2016, and Phase 2 emissions budgets will apply in 2017 and beyond. CSAPR replaced CAIR beginning in January 2015. In September 2016, the EPA issued a revision to CSAPR that reduces
the ozone season NO  X  emission budgets in 22 states beginning in 2017. The cost to comply with CSAPR, including the recent revision to the CSAPR ozone season NOx program, is not expected to be
material to Dominion s or Virginia Power s Consolidated Financial Statements.     Ozone Standards   
 In October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule tightening the ozone standard, set in 2008, from 75-ppb to 70-ppb. To comply with the 2008 standard, in April 2016
Virginia Power submitted the NO X  Reasonable Available Control Technology analysis for Unit 5 at Possum Point power station. The EPA is expected to complete attainment designations for a new
standard by December 2017 and states will have until 2020 or 2021 to develop plans to address the new standard. Until the states have developed implementation plans, the Companies are unable to predict whether or to what extent the new rules will
ultimately require additional controls. However, if significant expenditures are required to implement additional controls, it could adversely affect the Companies  results of operations and cash flows.  
  NO x  and VOC Emissions   
 In April 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection issued proposed regulations to reduce
NO X  and VOC emissions from combustion sources. The regulations were finalized in April 2016. To comply with the regulations, Dominion Gas anticipates installing emission control systems on
existing engines at several compressor stations in Pennsylvania. The compliance costs associated with engineering and installation of controls and compliance demonstration with the regulation are expected to be approximately $25 million.  
  NSPS     In August 2012, the EPA issued the first NSPS
impacting new and modified facilities in the natural gas production and gathering sectors and made revisions to the NSPS for natural gas processing and transmission facilities. These rules establish equipment performance specifications and emissions
standards for control of VOC emissions for natural gas production wells, tanks, pneumatic controllers, and compressors in the upstream sector. In September 2015, the EPA issued a proposed NSPS (for the oil and natural gas sector) to regulate methane
and VOC emissions from new and modified facilities in transmission and storage, gathering and boosting, production and processing facilities. The proposed regulation was finalized in June 2016. All projects which commenced construction after
September 2015 will be required to comply with this regulation. Dominion and Dominion Gas are implementing the final regulation. Dominion and Dominion Gas are still evaluating whether potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition
and/or cash flows related to this matter will be material.     Methane Emissions   
 In January 2015, as part of its Climate Action Plan, the EPA announced plans to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector including natural gas
processing and transmission sources. In July 2015, the EPA announced the next generation of its voluntary Natural Gas STAR program, the Natural Gas STAR Methane Challenge Program. The proposed program covers the entire natural gas sector from
production to distribution, with more emphasis on transparency and increased reporting for both annual emissions and reductions achieved through implementation measures. In March 2016, Dominion and Dominion Questar

joined the EPA as founding partners in this program for its distribution companies, East Ohio and Hope, DTI and Questar Gas. In September 2016, Dominion and Dominion Questar, prior to the
Dominion Questar Combination, submitted implementation plans for participation in the Methane Challenge Program to the EPA.    In March 2016, as part of its
Climate Action Plan, the EPA began development of regulations for reducing methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sectors. In June 2016 and September 2016, the EPA issued a draft Information Collection Request to collect
information on existing sources upstream of distribution in this sector. The final Information Collection Request is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. Depending on the results of this Information Collection Request effort, the EPA may propose
new regulations on existing sources. Dominion and Dominion Gas cannot currently estimate the potential impacts on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows related to this matter.  
   Climate Change Legislation and Regulation      In
October 2013, the United States Supreme Court granted petitions filed by several industry groups, states, and the United States Chamber of Commerce seeking review of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit s June
2012 decision upholding the EPA s regulation of GHG emissions from stationary sources under the CAA s permitting programs. In June 2014, the United States Supreme Court ruled that the EPA lacked the authority under the CAA to require PSD
or Title V permits for stationary sources based solely on GHG emissions. However, the Court upheld the EPA s ability to require BACT for GHG for sources that are otherwise subject to PSD or Title V permitting for conventional pollutants. In
July 2014, the EPA issued a memorandum specifying that it will no longer apply or enforce federal regulations or EPA-approved PSD state implementation plan provisions that require new and modified stationary sources to obtain a PSD permit when GHGs
are the only pollutant that would be emitted at levels that exceed the permitting thresholds. In August 2015, the EPA published a final rule rescinding the requirement for all new and modified major sources to obtain permits based solely on their
GHG emissions. In addition, the EPA stated that it will continue to use the existing thresholds to apply to sources that are otherwise subject to PSD for conventional pollutants until it completes a new rulemaking either justifying and upholding
those thresholds or setting new ones. Some states have issued interim guidance that follows the EPA guidance. In August 2016, the EPA issued a draft rule proposing to reaffirm that a source s obligation to obtain a PSD or Title V permit for
GHGs is triggered only if such permitting requirements are first triggered by non-GHG, or conventional, pollutants that are regulated by the New Source Review program, and to set a significant emissions rate at 75,000 tons per year of CO 2  equivalent emissions under which a source would not be required to apply BACT for its GHG emissions. Until the EPA ultimately takes final action on this rulemaking, the Companies cannot predict
the impact to their financial statements.    In July 2011, the EPA signed a final rule deferring the need for PSD and Title V permitting for CO 2  emissions for biomass projects. This rule temporarily deferred for a period of up to three years the consideration of CO 2  emissions from
biomass projects when determining whether a stationary source meets the PSD and Title V applicability thresholds, including those for the application of BACT. The deferral policy expired in July 2014. In July 2013, the United States Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated this rule; however, a mandate making this decision effective has not been issued. Virginia Power converted three coal-fired generating stations, Altavista, Hopewell and Southampton, to
biomass during the CO 2  deferral period. It is unclear how the court s decision or the EPA s final policy regarding the treatment of specific feedstock will affect biomass sources
that were permitted during the deferral period; however, the expenditures to comply with any new requirements could be material to Dominion s and Virginia Power s financial statements.  
   Water      The CWA, as amended, is a comprehensive
program requiring a broad range of regulatory tools including a permit program to authorize and regulate discharges to surface waters with strong enforcement mechanisms. The Companies must comply with applicable aspects of the CWA programs at their
operating facilities.    In October 2014, the final regulations under Section 316(b) of the CWA that govern existing facilities and new units at
existing facilities that employ a cooling water intake structure and that have flow levels exceeding a minimum threshold became effective. The rule establishes a national standard for impingement based on seven compliance options, but forgoes the
creation of a single technology standard for entrainment. Instead, the EPA has delegated entrainment technology decisions to state regulators. State regulators are to make case-by-case entrainment technology determinations after an examination of
five mandatory facility-specific factors, including a social cost-benefit test, and six optional facility-specific factors. The rule governs all electric generating stations with water withdrawals above two MGD, with a heightened entrainment
analysis for those facilities over 125 MGD. Dominion and Virginia Power have 14 and 11 facilities, respectively, that may be subject to the final regulations. Dominion anticipates that it will have to install impingement control technologies at many
of these stations that have once-through cooling systems. Dominion and Virginia Power are currently evaluating the need or potential for entrainment controls under the final rule as these decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis after a
thorough review of detailed biological, technology, cost and benefit studies. While the impacts of this rule could be material to Dominion s and Virginia Power s results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows, the existing
regulatory framework in Virginia provides rate recovery mechanisms that could substantially mitigate any such impacts for Virginia Power.

  In September 2015, the EPA released a final rule to revise the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for the Steam
Electric Power Generating Category. The final rule establishes updated standards for wastewater discharges that apply primarily at coal and oil steam generating stations. Affected facilities are required to convert from wet to dry or closed cycle
coal ash management, improve existing wastewater treatment systems and/or install new wastewater treatment technologies in order to meet the new discharge limits. Virginia Power has eight facilities that may be subject to additional wastewater
treatment requirements associated with the final rule. The expenditures to comply with these new requirements are expected to be material.      Solid
and Hazardous Waste      The CERCLA, as amended, provides for immediate response and removal actions coordinated by the EPA in the event of threatened
releases of hazardous substances into the environment and authorizes the United States government either to clean up sites at which hazardous substances have created actual or potential environmental hazards or to order persons responsible for the
situation to do so. Under the CERCLA, as amended, generators and transporters of hazardous substances, as well as past and present owners and operators of contaminated sites, can be jointly, severally and strictly liable for the cost of cleanup.
These potentially responsible parties can be ordered to perform a cleanup, be sued for costs associated with an EPA-directed cleanup, voluntarily settle with the United States government concerning their liability for cleanup costs, or voluntarily
begin a site investigation and site remediation under state oversight.    From time to time, Dominion, Virginia Power, or Dominion Gas may be identified as
a potentially responsible party to a Superfund site. The EPA (or a state) can either allow such a party to conduct and pay for a remedial investigation, feasibility study and remedial action or conduct the remedial investigation and action itself
and then seek reimbursement from the potentially responsible parties. Each party can be held jointly, severally and strictly liable for the cleanup costs. These parties can also bring contribution actions against each other and seek reimbursement
from their insurance companies. As a result, Dominion, Virginia Power, or Dominion Gas may be responsible for the costs of remedial investigation and actions under the Superfund law or other laws or regulations regarding the remediation of waste.
The Companies do not believe these matters will have a material effect on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.    In September
2011, the EPA issued a UAO to Virginia Power and 22 other parties, pursuant to CERCLA, ordering specific remedial action of certain areas at the Ward Transformer Superfund site located in Raleigh, North Carolina. In September 2016, the United
States, on behalf of the EPA, lodged a proposed Remedial Design/Remedial Action Consent Decree with the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, settling claims related to the site between the EPA and a number of
parties, including Virginia Power. The Consent Decree identifies Virginia Power as a non-performing cash-out party to the settlement and, once approved by the court, would resolve Virginia Power s alleged liability under CERCLA with respect to
the site, including liability pursuant to the UAO. The ultimate outcome of this matter depends on the approval of the Consent Decree by the Court, and cannot be predicted at this time; however, this matter is not expected to have a material
effect on Virginia Power.    Dominion has determined that it is associated with 19 former manufactured gas plant sites, three of which pertain to Virginia
Power and 12 of which pertain to Dominion Gas. Studies conducted by other utilities at their former manufactured gas plant sites have indicated that those sites contain coal tar and other potentially harmful materials. None of the former sites with
which the Companies are associated is under investigation by any state or federal environmental agency. At one of the former sites, Dominion is conducting a state-approved post closure groundwater monitoring program and an environmental land use
restriction has been recorded. Another site has been accepted into a state-based voluntary remediation program. Virginia Power is currently evaluating the nature and extent of the contamination from this site as well as potential remedial options.
Preliminary costs for options under evaluation for the site range from $1 million to $22 million. Due to the uncertainty surrounding the other sites, the Companies are unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts.  
 See below for discussion on ash pond and landfill closure costs.  
  Other Legal Matters     The Companies are defendants in a
number of lawsuits and claims involving unrelated incidents of property damage and personal injury. Due to the uncertainty surrounding these matters, the Companies are unable to make an estimate of the potential financial statement impacts; however,
they could have a material impact on results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.

    Appalachian Gateway    
  Pipeline Contractor Litigation     Following the completion
of the Appalachian Gateway project in 2012, DTI received multiple change order requests and other claims for additional payments from a pipeline contractor for the project. In July 2013, DTI filed a complaint in United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Virginia for breach of contract as well as accounting and declaratory relief. The contractor filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion to transfer venue to Pennsylvania and/or West Virginia, where the pipelines
were constructed. DTI filed an opposition to the contractor s motion in August 2013. In November 2013, the court granted the contractor s motion on the basis that DTI must first comply with the dispute resolution process. In July 2015, the
contractor filed a complaint against DTI in United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. In August 2015, DTI filed a motion to dismiss, or in the alternative, a motion to transfer venue to Virginia. In March 2016, the
Pennsylvania court granted the motion to dismiss and transferred the case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. In April 2016, the Virginia court issued an order staying the proceedings and ordering mediation. A
mediation occurred in May 2016 but was unsuccessful. In July 2016, DTI filed a motion to dismiss. This case is pending. DTI has accrued a liability of $6 million for this matter. Dominion Gas cannot currently estimate additional financial statement
impacts, but there could be a material impact to its financial condition and/or cash flows.     Gas Producers Litigation   
 In connection with the Appalachian Gateway project, Dominion Field Services, Inc. entered into contracts for firm purchase rights with a group of small gas
producers. In June 2016, the gas producers filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of Marshall County, West Virginia against Dominion, DTI and Dominion Field Services, Inc., among other defendants, claiming that the contracts are unenforceable and
seeking compensatory and punitive damages. During the third quarter of 2016, Dominion, DTI and Dominion Field Services, Inc. were served with the complaint. Also in the third quarter of 2016, Dominion and DTI, with the consent of the other
defendants, removed the case to the United States District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia. In October 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. This case is pending. Dominion and Dominion Gas cannot currently estimate
financial statement impacts, but there could be a material impact to their financial condition and/or cash flows.      Ash Pond and Landfill Closure
Costs      In September 2014, Virginia Power received a notice from the Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of the Potomac Riverkeeper and
Sierra Club alleging CWA violations at Possum Point power station. The notice alleges unpermitted discharges to surface water and groundwater from Possum Point power station s historical and active ash storage facilities. A similar notice from
the Southern Environmental Law Center on behalf of the Sierra Club was subsequently received related to Chesapeake power station. In December 2014, Virginia Power offered to close all of its coal ash ponds and landfills at Possum Point power
station, Chesapeake and Bremo power stations as settlement of the potential litigation. While the issue is open to potential further negotiations, the Southern Environmental Law Center declined the offer as presented in January 2015 and, in March
2015, filed a lawsuit related to its claims of the alleged CWA violations at Chesapeake power station. Virginia Power filed a motion to dismiss in April 2015, which was denied in November 2015. A trial was held in June 2016. This case is pending. As
a result of the December 2014 settlement offer, Virginia Power recognized a charge of $121 million in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statements of Income in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2014.    In April 2015, the EPA s final rule regulating the management of CCRs stored in impoundments (ash ponds) and landfills
was published in the Federal Register. The final rule regulates CCR landfills, existing ash ponds that still receive and manage CCRs, and inactive ash ponds that do not receive, but still store CCRs. Virginia Power currently operates inactive ash
ponds, existing ash ponds, and CCR landfills subject to the final rule at eight different facilities. The enactment of the final rule in April 2015 created a legal obligation for Virginia Power to retrofit or close all of its inactive and
existing ash ponds over a certain period of time, as well as perform required monitoring, corrective action, and post-closure care activities as necessary. In April 2016, the EPA announced a partial settlement with certain environmental and industry
organizations that had challenged the final CCR rule in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. As part of the settlement, certain exemptions included in the final rule for inactive ponds that closed by April
2018 will be removed, resulting in inactive ponds ultimately being subject to the same requirements as existing ponds. In June 2016, the court issued an order approving the settlement, which requires the EPA to modify provisions in the final
CCR rule concerning inactive ponds. In August 2016, the EPA issued a final rule, effective October 2016, extending certain compliance deadlines in the final CCR rule for inactive ponds. Virginia Power does not believe these changes will
substantially impact its closure plans for inactive ponds.    In 2015, Virginia Power recorded a $386 million ARO related to future ash pond and landfill
closure costs. Recognition of the ARO also resulted in a $99 million incremental charge recorded in other operations and maintenance expense in its Consolidated Statement of Income, a $166 million increase in property, plant, and equipment
associated with asset retirement costs, and a $121 million reduction in other noncurrent liabilities related to reversal of the contingent liability described above since the ARO obligation created by the final CCR rule represents similar
activities. Virginia Power is in the process of

obtaining the necessary permits to complete the work. In February and March 2016, respectively, two parties filed administrative appeals in the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond challenging
certain provisions, relating to ash pond dewatering activities, of Possum Point power station s wastewater discharge permit issued by the VDEQ in January 2016. One of those parties withdrew its appeal in June 2016. In November 2016, the court
dismissed the remaining appeal. The actual AROs related to the CCR rule may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased obligation in 2015.  
   Cove Point      Dominion is constructing the
Liquefaction Project at the Cove Point facility, which would enable the facility to liquefy domestically-produced natural gas and export it as LNG. In September 2014, FERC issued an order granting authorization for Cove Point to construct, modify
and operate the Liquefaction Project. In October 2014, several parties filed a motion with FERC to stay the order and requested rehearing. In May 2015, FERC denied the requests for stay and rehearing.  
 Two parties have separately filed petitions for review of the FERC order in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which
petitions were consolidated. Separately, one party requested a stay of the FERC order until the judicial proceedings are complete, which the court denied in June 2015. In July 2016, the court denied one party s petition for review of the FERC
order authorizing the Liquefaction Project. The court also issued a decision remanding the other party s petition for review of the FERC order to FERC for further explanation of FERC s decision that a previous transaction with an existing
import shipper was not unduly discriminatory. Cove Point believes that on remand FERC will be able to justify its decision.   In September 2013, the
DOE granted Non-FTA Authorization approval for the export of up to 0.77 bcfe/day of natural gas to countries that do not have an FTA for trade in natural gas. In June 2016, a party filed a petition for review of this approval in the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. This case is pending.      FERC    
 The FERC staff in the Office of Enforcement, Division of Investigations, is conducting a non-public investigation of Virginia Power s offers of combustion
turbines generators into the PJM day-ahead markets from April 2010 through September 2014. The FERC staff notified Virginia Power of its preliminary findings relating to Virginia Power s alleged violation of FERC s rules in connection with
these activities. Virginia Power has provided its response to the FERC staff s preliminary findings letter explaining why Virginia Power s conduct was lawful and refuting any allegation of wrongdoing. Virginia Power is cooperating fully
with the investigation; however, it cannot currently predict whether or to what extent it may incur a material liability.      Greensville County
     Virginia Power is constructing Greensville County and related transmission interconnection facilities. In July 2016, the Sierra Club filed an
administrative appeal in the Circuit Court for the City of Richmond challenging certain provisions in Greensville County s PSD air permit issued by VDEQ in June 2016. Virginia Power is currently unable to make an estimate of the potential
impacts to its consolidated financial statements related to this matter.     Nuclear Matters   
 In March 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake and subsequent tsunami caused significant damage at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station in northeast Japan.
These events have resulted in significant nuclear safety reviews required by the NRC and industry groups such as the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations. Like other United States nuclear operators, Dominion has been gathering supporting data and
participating in industry initiatives focused on the ability to respond to and mitigate the consequences of design-basis and beyond-design-basis events at its stations.  
 In July 2011, an NRC task force provided initial recommendations based on its review of the Fukushima Daiichi accident and in October 2011 the NRC staff
prioritized these recommendations into Tiers 1, 2 and 3, with the Tier 1 recommendations consisting of actions which the staff determined should be started without unnecessary delay. In December 2011, the NRC Commissioners approved the agency
staff s prioritization and recommendations, and that same month an appropriations act directed the NRC to require reevaluation of external hazards (not limited to seismic and flooding hazards) as soon as possible.  
 Based on the prioritized recommendations, in March 2012, the NRC issued orders and information requests requiring specific reviews and actions to all
operating reactors, construction permit holders and combined license holders based on the lessons learned from the Fukushima Daiichi event. The orders applicable to Dominion requiring implementation of safety enhancements related to mitigation
strategies to respond to extreme natural events resulting in the loss of power at plants, and enhancing spent fuel pool instrumentation have been implemented. The information requests issued by the NRC request each reactor to reevaluate the
seismic and external flooding hazards at their site using present-day methods and information, conduct walkdowns of their facilities to ensure protection against the hazards in their current design basis, and to reevaluate their emergency
communications systems and staffing levels. The walkdowns of each unit have been completed, audited by the NRC  
      75  

Table of Contents  

and found to be adequate. Reevaluation of the emergency communications systems and staffing levels was completed as part of the effort to comply with the orders. Reevaluation of the seismic and
external flooding hazards is expected to continue through 2018. Dominion and Virginia Power do not currently expect that compliance with the NRC s information requests will materially impact their financial position, results of operations or
cash flows during the implementation period. The NRC staff is evaluating the implementation of the longer term Tier 2 and Tier 3 recommendations. Dominion and Virginia Power do not expect material financial impacts related to compliance with Tier 2
and Tier 3 recommendations.     Guarantees, Surety Bonds and Letters of Credit   
   Dominion      At September 30, 2016, Dominion had
issued $73 million of guarantees, primarily to support equity method investees. No significant amounts related to these guarantees have been recorded. As of September 30, 2016, Dominion s exposure under these guarantees was $43
million, primarily related to certain reserve requirements associated with non-recourse financing.    Dominion also enters into guarantee arrangements on
behalf of its consolidated subsidiaries, primarily to facilitate their commercial transactions with third parties. To the extent that a liability subject to a guarantee has been incurred by one of Dominion s consolidated subsidiaries, that
liability is included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Dominion is not required to recognize liabilities for guarantees issued on behalf of its subsidiaries unless it becomes probable that it will have to perform under the guarantees. Terms
of the guarantees typically end once obligations have been paid. Dominion currently believes it is unlikely that it would be required to perform or otherwise incur any losses associated with guarantees of its subsidiaries  obligations.  
 At September 30, 2016, Dominion had issued the following subsidiary guarantees:  

(1) 
 Represents the estimated portion of the guarantee s stated limit that is utilized as of September 30, 2016 based upon prevailing economic conditions and fact patterns specific to each guarantee arrangement.
For those guarantees related to obligations that are recorded as liabilities by Dominion s subsidiaries, the value includes the recorded amount.    

(2) 
 Guarantee of debt of a DEI subsidiary. In the event of default by the subsidiary, Dominion would be obligated to repay such amounts.    

(3) 
 Guarantees related to commodity commitments of certain subsidiaries, including subsidiaries of Virginia Power, Dominion Gas and DEI. These guarantees were provided to counterparties in order to facilitate physical and
financial transactions in gas, oil, electricity, pipeline capacity, transportation and related commodities and services. If any of these subsidiaries fail to perform or pay under the contracts and the counterparties seek performance or payment,
Dominion would be obligated to satisfy such obligation. Dominion and its subsidiaries receive similar guarantees as collateral for credit extended to others. The value provided includes certain guarantees that do not have stated limits.

(4) 
 Guarantees related to certain DEI subsidiaries  potential retrospective premiums that could be assessed if there is a nuclear incident under Dominion s nuclear insurance programs and guarantees for a DEI
subsidiary s and Virginia Power s commitment to buy nuclear fuel. Excludes Dominion s agreement to provide up to $150 million and $60 million to two DEI subsidiaries to pay the operating expenses of Millstone nuclear power station (in
the event of a prolonged outage) and Kewaunee nuclear power station, respectively, as part of satisfying certain NRC requirements concerned with ensuring adequate funding for the operations of nuclear power stations. The agreement for Kewaunee
nuclear power station also provides for funds through the completion of decommissioning.    

(5) 
 Guarantees related to Cove Point, in support of terminal services, transportation and construction. Two of the guarantees have no stated limit, one guarantee has a $150 million limit, and one guarantee has a $1.75
billion aggregate limit with an annual draw limit of $175 million.    

(6) 
 Includes guarantees related to solar projects including guarantees that do not have stated limits. Also includes guarantees related to solar projects entered into by DEI on behalf of certain subsidiaries.

(7) 
 Guarantees related to other miscellaneous contractual obligations such as leases, environmental obligations and construction projects. Also includes guarantees related to certain DEI subsidiaries  obligations for
equity capital contributions and energy generation associated with Fowler Ridge and NedPower. As of September 30, 2016, Dominion s maximum remaining cumulative exposure under these equity funding agreements is $36 million through 2019 and
its maximum annual future contributions could range from approximately $4 million to $19 million. The value provided includes certain guarantees that do not have stated limits.    
      76

  Additionally, at September 30, 2016, Dominion had purchased $147 million of surety bonds, including $70
million at Virginia Power and $21 million at Dominion Gas, and authorized the issuance of letters of credit by financial institutions of $60 million to facilitate commercial transactions by its subsidiaries with third parties. Under the terms of
surety bonds, the Companies are obligated to indemnify the respective surety bond company for any amounts paid.     Note 16. Credit Risk   
 The Companies  accounting policies for credit risk are discussed in Note 23 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Companies  Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.    At September 30, 2016, Dominion s credit exposure related to energy marketing and price
risk management activities totaled $96 million. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those internally rated, represented 70%. No single counterparty, whether investment grade or non-investment grade, exceeded $21 million of
exposure. At September 30, 2016, Virginia Power s exposure related to sales to wholesale customers totaled $23 million. Of this amount, investment grade counterparties, including those internally rated, represented 35%. No single
counterparty, whether investment grade or non-investment grade, exceeded $4 million of exposure.     Credit-Related Contingent Provisions   
 The majority of Dominion s derivative instruments contain credit-related contingent provisions. These provisions require Dominion to provide collateral
upon the occurrence of specific events, primarily a credit rating downgrade. If the credit-related contingent features underlying these instruments that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash were fully triggered as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, Dominion would have been required to post an additional $7 million and $12 million, respectively, of collateral to its counterparties. The collateral that would be required to be posted includes
the impacts of any offsetting asset positions and any amounts already posted for derivatives, non-derivative contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales exception, per contractual terms. Dominion had not posted any
collateral at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015 related to derivatives with credit-related contingent provisions that are in a liability position and not fully collateralized with cash. The collateral posted includes any amounts paid
related to non-derivative contracts and derivatives elected under the normal purchases and normal sales exception, per contractual terms. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-related contingent provisions that are in a
liability position and not fully collateralized with cash as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $18 million and $49 million, respectively, which does not include the impact of any offsetting asset positions. Credit-related
contingent provisions for Virginia Power and Dominion Gas were not material as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. See Note 9 for further information about derivative instruments.  
  Note 17. Related-Party Transactions     Virginia Power
and Dominion Gas engage in related-party transactions primarily with other Dominion subsidiaries (affiliates). Virginia Power s and Dominion Gas  receivable and payable balances with affiliates are settled based on contractual terms or on
a monthly basis, depending on the nature of the underlying transactions. Virginia Power and Dominion Gas are included in Dominion s consolidated federal income tax return. Dominion s transactions with equity method investments are
described in Note 10. A discussion of significant related-party transactions follows.     Virginia Power   
   Transactions with Affiliates      Virginia Power
transacts with affiliates for certain quantities of natural gas and other commodities in the ordinary course of business. Virginia Power also enters into certain commodity derivative contracts with affiliates. Virginia Power uses these contracts,
which are principally comprised of commodity physical forwards and options, to manage commodity price risks associated with purchases of natural gas. As of September 30, 2016, Virginia Power s derivative assets and liabilities with
affiliates were $28 million and $15 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, Virginia Power s derivative assets and liabilities with affiliates were $13 million and $22 million, respectively. See Note 9 for more information.  
 Virginia Power participates in certain Dominion benefit plans described in Note 18. In Virginia Power s Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, amounts due to Dominion associated with these benefit plans included in other deferred credits and other liabilities were $376 million and $316 million, respectively, and amounts due from Dominion at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 included in other deferred charges and other assets were $111 million and $77 million, respectively.

  Note 18. Employee Benefit Plans     In the first
quarter of 2016, the Companies announced an organizational design initiative that will reduce their total workforces during 2016. The goal of the organizational design initiative was to streamline leadership structure and push decision making
lower while also improving efficiency. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Dominion recorded a $65 million ($40 million after-tax) charge, including $33 million ($20 million after-tax) at Virginia Power and $8 million ($5
million after-tax) at Dominion Gas, primarily reflected in other operations and maintenance expense in their Consolidated Statements of Income due to severance pay and other costs related to the organizational design initiative. The terms of

     Plan Amendment and Remeasurement    
 In the third quarter of 2016, Dominion remeasured an other postretirement benefit plan as a result of an amendment that changed post-65 retiree medical
coverage for certain current and future Local 50 retirees effective April 1, 2017. The remeasurement resulted in a decrease in Dominion s accumulated postretirement benefit obligation of $37 million. The impact of the remeasurement on net
periodic benefit credit was recognized prospectively from the remeasurement date and is expected to increase the net periodic benefit credit for 2016 by $9 million. The discount rate used for the remeasurement was 3.71% and the demographic and
mortality assumptions were updated using plan-specific studies and mortality improvement scales. The expected long-term rate of return used was consistent with the measurement as of December 31, 2015.

  Results of Operations     Presented below is a summary of
Dominion s consolidated results:      
    Overview       Third
Quarter 2016 vs. 2015      Net income attributable to Dominion increased 16%, primarily due to higher renewable energy investment tax credits, an
increase in electric utility sales to retail customers from an increase in cooling degree days and the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016. These increases were partially offset by transaction and transition costs due to the
Dominion Questar Combination.      Year-To-Date 2016 vs. 2015    
 Net income attributable to Dominion increased 8%, primarily due to higher renewable energy investment tax credits and the new PJM capacity performance market
effective June 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields and transaction and transition costs due to the Dominion Questar
Combination.     Analysis of Consolidated Operations   
 Presented below are selected amounts related to Dominion s results of operations:  
   
   An analysis of Dominion s results of operations follows:  
  Third Quarter 2016 vs. 2015      Net revenue  increased
13%, primarily reflecting:        

A $272 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting:        

An $81 million electric capacity benefit, primarily due to the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016 ($70 million) and the expiration of non-utility generator contracts in 2015 ($16 million);

An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($78 million); and        

An increase in sales to retail customers from an increase in cooling degree days ($74 million); and        

A $32 million increase due to the Dominion Questar Combination; partially offset by        

A $22 million decrease from merchant generation operations, primarily due to lower realized prices.    
      86  

Table of Contents  

   Other operations and maintenance  increased 36%, primarily reflecting:    

A $51 million increase due to the Dominion Questar Combination, including $40 million of transaction and transition costs;        

A $50 million increase in salaries, wages and benefits;        

A $47 million decrease in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields; and    

A $21 million increase due to labor contract renegotiations as well as costs resulting from a union workforce temporary work stoppage.    
  Depreciation, depletion and amortization  increased 13%, primarily due to various expansion projects being placed into service ($32 million) and the
Dominion Questar Combination ($9 million).       Other income  increased $52 million, primarily due to higher realized gains (including investment
income) on nuclear decommissioning trust funds ($25 million) and an increase in earnings from equity method investments ($15 million).       Income
tax expense  decreased 25%, primarily due to higher renewable energy investment tax credits ($63 million) and a settlement with a tax authority ($12 million), partially offset by higher pre-tax income ($21 million).    
  Year-To-Date 2016 vs. 2015      Net revenue  increased
4%, primarily reflecting:        

A $355 million increase from electric utility operations, primarily reflecting:        

A $147 million electric capacity benefit, primarily due to the new PJM capacity performance market effective June 2016 ($92 million) and the expiration of non-utility generator contracts in 2015 ($56 million);

An increase from rate adjustment clauses ($129 million); and        

The absence of an $85 million write-off of deferred fuel costs associated with Virginia legislation enacted in February 2015; partially offset by    

A decrease in sales to retail customers from a reduction in cooling and heating degree days ($58 million); and        

A $32 million increase due to the Dominion Questar Combination.      These increases were partially offset by:

A $61 million decrease from merchant generation operations, primarily due to lower volumes from planned and unplanned outage days ($63 million) and lower realized prices ($34 million), partially offset by additional
solar generating facilities placed into service ($27 million);        

A $36 million decrease from regulated natural gas distribution operations, primarily due to a decrease in rate adjustment clause revenue related to low income assistance programs ($33 million) and a decrease in sales to
customers due to a reduction in heating degree days ($11 million), partially offset by an increase in AMR and PIR program revenues ($12 million); and        

A $27 million decrease from regulated natural gas transmission operations, primarily due to:        

A $24 million decrease in gas transportation and storage activities, primarily due to decreased demand charges ($29 million) and decreased fuel retained ($11 million), partially offset by the acquisition of DCG and
related expansion projects ($12 million); and        

A $17 million decrease in NGL activities, due to decreased volumes ($12 million) and prices ($5 million); partially offset by        

A $17 million increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline.       Other operations and
maintenance  increased 14%, primarily reflecting:        

A $78 million decrease in gains from agreements to convey shale development rights underneath several natural gas storage fields;        

A $58 million increase due to the Dominion Questar Combination, including $47 million of transaction and transition costs;        

Organizational design initiative costs ($64 million);

A $21 million increase due to labor contract renegotiations as well as costs resulting from a union workforce temporary work stoppage; and    

A $17 million increase in services performed for Atlantic Coast Pipeline. These expenses are billed to Atlantic Coast Pipeline and do not significantly impact net income.    
 These increases were partially offset by:      

The absence of a $45 million charge related to ash pond and landfill closure costs at certain utility generation facilities; and        

A $33 million decrease in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily related to low income assistance programs. These bad debt expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net
income.       Other income  increased 49%, primarily due to an increase in earnings from equity method investments ($43 million) and an
increase in AFUDC costs associated with rate-regulated projects ($9 million).       Income tax expense  decreased 29%, primarily due to higher
renewable energy investment tax credits ($153 million), lower pre-tax income ($27 million), the impact of a state legislative change ($17 million) and a settlement with a tax authority ($12 million).

A $33 million decrease in bad debt expense at regulated natural gas distribution operations primarily related to low income assistance programs. These bad debt expenses are recovered through rates and do not impact net
income.       Other income  increased 29%, primarily due to a gain on the sale of 0.65% of the non-controlling partnership interest in
Iroquois.       Interest and related charges  increased 28%, primarily due to higher interest expense resulting from the issuances of senior notes
in November 2015 and the second quarter of 2016.       Income tax expense  decreased 30%, primarily reflecting lower pre-tax income ($56 million)
and a settlement with a tax authority ($12 million).       Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 Dominion depends on both internal and external sources of liquidity to provide working capital and as a bridge to long-term debt financings. Short-term cash
requirements not met by cash provided by operations are generally satisfied with proceeds from short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs are met through issuances of debt and/or equity securities.  
 In September 2015, Dominion initiated a program to purchase from the market up to $50 million of common units representing limited partner interests in
Dominion Midstream, which expired in September 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Dominion purchased approximately 658,000 common units for $17 million.  
 Given the sufficiency of operating and other cash flows at the Dominion level, no dividends were declared or paid to Dominion by either Virginia Power or
Dominion Gas during the first quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, no dividends were declared or paid to Dominion by Virginia Power. During the third quarter of 2016, no dividends were declared or paid to Dominion by either
Virginia Power or Dominion Gas.    At September 30, 2016, Dominion had $3.1 billion of unused capacity under its credit facilities. See Note 14 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.    A summary of Dominion s cash flows is presented below:  
   
    Operating Cash Flows     Net
cash provided by Dominion s operating activities decreased $67 million, primarily due to changes in net margin collateral requirements and higher operations and maintenance expenses, partially offset by the benefit from the new PJM capacity
performance market, higher deferred fuel cost recoveries in its Virginia jurisdiction, and net changes in other working capital items.    Dominion believes
that its operations provide a stable source of cash flow to contribute to planned levels of capital expenditures and maintain or grow the dividend on common shares.  
      94  

Table of Contents  

  Dominion s operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that may negatively impact the timing or
amounts of operating cash flows, which are discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
   Credit Risk      Dominion s exposure to potential
concentrations of credit risk results primarily from its energy marketing and price risk management activities. Presented below is a summary of Dominion s credit exposure as of September 30, 2016 for these activities. Gross credit exposure
for each counterparty is calculated prior to the application of collateral and represents outstanding receivables plus any unrealized on- or off-balance sheet exposure, taking into account contractual netting rights.  

(1) 
 Designations as investment grade are based upon minimum credit ratings assigned by Moody s Investors Service and Standard   Poor s. The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category
represented approximately 49% of the total net credit exposure.    

(2) 
 The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 6% of the total net credit exposure.    

(3) 
 The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 9% of the total net credit exposure.    

(4) 
 The five largest counterparty exposures, combined, for this category represented approximately 16% of the total net credit exposure.    
  Investing Cash Flows     Net cash used in Dominion s
investing activities increased $4.7 billion, primarily due to the Dominion Questar Combination and higher capital expenditures, partially offset by the absence of Dominion s acquisition of DCG in 2015 and the acquisition of fewer solar
development projects in 2016.     Financing Cash Flows and Liquidity   
 Dominion relies on capital markets as significant sources of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by cash provided by its operations. As discussed
further in  Credit Ratings  and  Debt Covenants  in MD A in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the ability to borrow funds or issue securities and the return demanded by investors
are affected by credit ratings. In addition, the raising of external capital is subject to certain regulatory requirements, including registration with the SEC for certain issuances.  
 Dominion currently meets the definition of a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules governing the registration, communications and offering processes
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The rules provide for a streamlined shelf registration process to provide registrants with timely access to capital. This allows Dominion to use automatic shelf registration statements to register any
offering of securities, other than those for exchange offers or business combination transactions.    Net cash provided by Dominion s financing
activities increased $4.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher net debt issuances and higher common stock issuances in connection with the Dominion Questar Combination.  
 See Notes 3 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this report for further information regarding Dominion s credit facilities, liquidity and
significant financing transactions.        Credit Ratings   
 Credit ratings are intended to provide banks and capital market participants with a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a
recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. In the  Credit Ratings  section of MD A in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, there is a discussion on the use of capital markets by
Dominion as well as the impact of credit ratings on the accessibility and costs of using these markets.    In March 2016, Fitch Ratings Ltd. and
Standard   Poor s changed the rating for Dominion s junior subordinated debt securities to account for its inability to defer interest payments on the remarketed 2013 Series A RSNs. Junior subordinated debt securities with an
interest deferral feature are rated one notch lower by Fitch Ratings Ltd. and Standard   Poor s (BBB-) than  
      95  

Table of Contents  

junior subordinated debt securities without an interest deferral feature (BBB). See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the remarketed notes. As of
September 30, 2016, there have been no additional changes in Dominion s credit ratings.     Debt Covenants   
 In the  Debt Covenants  section of MD A in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, there is a
discussion on the various covenants present in the enabling agreements underlying Dominion s debt. As of September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to debt covenants, nor any events of default under Dominion s debt
covenants. Pursuant to a waiver received in April 2016 and in connection with the closing of the Dominion Questar Combination, the 65% maximum debt to total capital ratio in Dominion s credit agreements has, with respect to Dominion only, been
temporarily increased to 70% until the end of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017.     Future Cash Payments for Contractual Obligations and
Planned Capital Expenditures     Other than debt and financing obligations associated with the Dominion Questar Combination discussed in Note 3 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, as of September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to Dominion s contractual obligations nor any material changes to planned capital expenditures as
disclosed in MD A in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.     Use of Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements     As of September 30, 2016, with the exception of the leasing arrangement described herein, there have been no material changes in the
off-balance sheet arrangements disclosed in MD A in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
   Leasing Arrangement      In July 2016, Dominion signed
an agreement with a lessor to construct and lease a new corporate office property in Richmond, Virginia. The lessor is providing equity and has obtained financing commitments from debt investors to fund the project costs, totaling $365 million. The
project is expected to be completed by mid-2019. Dominion has been appointed to act as the construction agent for the lessor, during which time Dominion will request cash draws from the lessor and debt investors to fund all project costs. If the
project is terminated under certain events of default, Dominion could be required to pay up to 89.9% of the then funded amount. For specific full recourse events, Dominion could be required to pay up to 100% of the then funded amount.  
 The five-year lease term will commence once construction is substantially complete and the facility is able to be occupied. At the end of the initial lease
term, Dominion can (i) extend the term of the lease for an additional five years, subject to the approval of the participants, at current market terms, (ii) purchase the property for an amount equal to the project costs or,
(iii) subject to certain terms and conditions, sell the property to a third party using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the highest cash purchase price for the property. If the project is sold and the proceeds from the sale are
insufficient to repay the investors for the project costs, Dominion may be required to make a payment to the lessor, up to 87% of project costs, for the difference between the project costs and sale proceeds.  
 The respective transactions have been structured so that Dominion is not considered the owner during construction for financial accounting purposes and,
therefore, will not reflect the construction activity in its consolidated financial statements. The financial accounting treatment of the lease agreement will be impacted by the new accounting standard issued in February 2016. Dominion will be
considered the owner of the leased property for tax purposes, and as a result, will be entitled to tax deductions for depreciation and interest expense.  
  Future Issues and Other Matters     The following discussion
of future issues and other information includes current developments of previously disclosed matters and new issues arising during the period covered by, and subsequent to, the dates of Dominion s Consolidated Financial Statements that may
impact future results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. This section should be read in conjunction with  Item 1. Business  and  Future Issues and Other Matters  in MD A in the Companies  Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and  Future Issues and Other Matters  in MD A in the Companies  Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  
  Environmental Matters     Dominion is subject to costs
resulting from a number of federal, state and local laws and regulations designed to protect human health and the environment. These laws and regulations affect future planning and existing operations. They can result in increased capital, operating
and other costs as a result of compliance, remediation, containment and monitoring obligations. See

Bargaining Agreement      In April 2016, the labor contract between Dominion and Local 69 expired. In August 2016, the parties reached a tentative
agreement for a new labor contract, however, the agreement was not submitted to members of Local 69 for approval. In September 2016, following a temporary lock out of union members, Local 69 agreed to not strike at DTI and Hope at least through
April 1, 2017. In exchange, DTI and Hope agreed to recall the union members to work and not lock them out during that period. Contract negotiations resumed in October 2016 and are continuing. Local 69 represents about 759 DTI employees in West
Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia and about 151 Hope employees in West Virginia.     Regulatory Matters

   Electric Transmission Project      In August 2016,
Virginia Power filed an application with the Virginia Commission for a CPCN to rebuild and operate in multiple Virginia counties approximately 28 miles of the existing 500 kV transmission line between the Carson switching station and a terminus
located near the Rogers Road switching station under construction in Greensville County, Virginia, along with associated work at the Carson switching station. The total estimated cost of the project is approximately $53 million. This case is
pending.

     ITEM 3.   
  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE   
  DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK     The matters
discussed in this Item may contain  forward-looking statements  as described in the introductory paragraphs under Part I, Item 2. MD A in this report. The reader s attention is directed to those paragraphs for discussion of
various risks and uncertainties that may impact the Companies.     Market Risk Sensitive Instruments and Risk Management   
 The Companies  financial instruments, commodity contracts and related financial derivative instruments are exposed to potential losses due to adverse
changes in commodity prices, interest rates and equity security prices as described below. Commodity price risk is present in Dominion s and Virginia Power s electric operations and Dominion s and Dominion Gas  natural gas
procurement and marketing operations due to the exposure to market shifts in prices received and paid for electricity, natural gas and other commodities. The Companies use commodity derivative contracts to manage price risk exposures for these
operations. Interest rate risk is generally related to their outstanding debt and future issuances of debt. In addition, the Companies are exposed to investment price risk through various portfolios of equity and debt securities.  
 The following sensitivity analysis estimates the potential loss of future earnings or fair value from market risk sensitive instruments over a selected time
period due to a 10% change in commodity prices or interest rates.      Commodity Price Risk    
 To manage price risk, Dominion and Virginia Power hold commodity-based derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes associated with purchases and sales
of electricity, natural gas and other energy-related products and Dominion Gas holds commodity-based financial derivative instruments held for non-trading purposes associated with purchases and sales of natural gas and other energy-related products.
   The derivatives used to manage commodity price risk are executed within established policies and procedures and may include instruments such as futures,
forwards, swaps, options and FTRs that are sensitive to changes in the related commodity prices. For sensitivity analysis purposes, the hypothetical change in market prices of commodity-based derivative instruments is determined based on models that
consider the market prices of commodities in future periods, the volatility of the market prices in each period, as well as the time value factors of the derivative instruments. Prices and volatility are principally determined based on observable
market prices.    A hypothetical 10% decrease in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of $34 million and $24 million of
Dominion s commodity-based derivative instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    A hypothetical 10%
decrease in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of $51 million and $42 million of Virginia Power s commodity-based derivative instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.    A hypothetical 10% increase in commodity prices would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of $4 million and $5 million of Dominion
Gas  commodity-based derivative instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.    The impact of a change in
energy commodity prices on the Companies  commodity-based derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net losses from
commodity-based financial derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction, such as revenue from physical sales of the commodity. Physical commodity-based
derivative instruments will be recognized as a gross revenue or expense based upon the transaction price and volume.      Interest Rate Risk
     The Companies manage their interest rate risk exposure predominantly by maintaining a balance of fixed and variable rate debt. They also enter
into interest rate sensitive derivatives, including interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements. For variable rate debt and interest rate swaps designated under fair value hedging and outstanding for the Companies, a hypothetical 10%
increase in market interest rates would not have resulted in a material change in earnings at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.    The
Companies may also use forward-starting interest rate swaps and interest rate lock agreements as anticipatory hedges.  
      98  

Table of Contents  

  As of September 30, 2016, Dominion and Virginia Power had $2.8 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, in
aggregate notional amounts of these interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $2 million and $46 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion s and
Virginia Power s interest rate derivatives at September 30, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, Dominion, Virginia Power and Dominion Gas had $4.6 billion, $2.0 billion and $250 million, respectively, in aggregate notional amounts of these
interest rate derivatives outstanding. A hypothetical 10% decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a decrease of $71 million, $52 million and $2 million, respectively, in the fair value of Dominion s, Virginia Power s and
Dominion Gas  interest rate derivatives at December 31, 2015.    In June 2016, Dominion Gas entered into foreign currency swaps with the purpose
of hedging the foreign currency exchange risk associated with Euro denominated debt. As of September 30, 2016, Dominion Gas had $280 million ( 250 million) in aggregate notional amounts of these foreign currency swaps outstanding. A
hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a $4 million decrease in the fair value of Dominion Gas  foreign currency swaps at September 30, 2016.  
 The impact of a change in interest rates on the Companies  interest rate-based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily
representative of the results that will be realized when the contracts are ultimately settled. Net gains and/or losses from interest rate derivative instruments used for hedging purposes, to the extent realized, will generally be offset by
recognition of the hedged transaction.      Investment Price Risk    
 Dominion and Virginia Power are subject to investment price risk due to securities held as investments in nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust funds that
are managed by third-party investment managers. These trust funds primarily hold marketable securities that are reported in Dominion s and Virginia Power s Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value.  
 Dominion recognized net realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning and rabbi trust investments of $113 million and $134 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $184 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any
other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Dominion recorded in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains on these investments of $146 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and a net decrease in
unrealized gains on these investments of $260 million and $157 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 Virginia Power recognized net realized gains (including investment income) on nuclear decommissioning trust investments of $51 million and $67 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $88 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net realized gains and losses include gains and losses from the sale of investments as well as any other-than-temporary
declines in fair value. Virginia Power recorded in AOCI and regulatory liabilities, a net increase in unrealized gains on these investments of $77 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and a net decrease in unrealized gains on
these investments of $123 million and $76 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively.  
 Dominion sponsors pension and other postretirement employee benefit plans that hold investments in trusts to fund employee benefit payments. Virginia Power
and Dominion Gas employees participate in these plans. Differences between actual and expected returns on plan assets are accumulated and amortized during future periods. As such, any investment-related declines in these trusts will result in future
increases in the net periodic cost recognized for employee benefit plans and will be included in the determination of the amount of cash to be contributed to the employee benefit plans.

     ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
 Senior management of each of Dominion, Virginia Power, and Dominion Gas, including Dominion s, Virginia Power s, and Dominion Gas  CEO and CFO,
evaluated the effectiveness of each of their respective Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation process, each of Dominion s, Virginia Power s, and
Dominion Gas  CEO and CFO have concluded that each of their respective Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.    There were
no changes in Dominion s, Virginia Power s, or Dominion Gas  internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Companies  internal control over financial reporting.    Dominion is currently in the process of integrating Dominion Questar s operations,
processes and internal controls. See Note 3 for more information relating to the Dominion Questar Combination.

   PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
    ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   
 From time to time, the Companies are alleged to be in violation or in default under orders, statutes, rules or regulations relating to the environment,
compliance plans imposed upon or agreed to by the Companies, or permits issued by various local, state and/or federal agencies for the construction or operation of facilities. Administrative proceedings may also be pending on these matters. In
addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Companies and their subsidiaries are involved in various legal proceedings.    In January 2015, DTI
received a draft consent agreement from the EPA in connection with alleged violations of certain CAA monitoring and permitting requirements at the Hastings facility. The draft consent agreement included a proposed penalty of approximately $160,000.
In September 2016, DTI and the EPA finalized a consent agreement and final order resolving this matter, which included a final penalty of $98,000.    In
January 2016, Virginia Power self-reported a release of mineral oil from the Crystal City substation and began extensive cleanup. In February 2016, Virginia Power received a notice of violation from the VDEQ relating to this matter. Virginia
Power has assumed the role of responsible party and is continuing to cooperate with ongoing requirements for investigative and corrective action. In September 2016, Virginia Power received a proposed consent order from the VDEQ related to this
matter. The proposed consent order includes a penalty of approximately $260,000, which is inclusive of both the Crystal City substation oil release and an oil release from another Virginia Power facility in 2016. The portion of the penalty
attributable to the other facility represents less than $100,000 of the total proposed penalty. Virginia Power has agreed to the terms of the proposed consent order, which is subject to final approval by the Virginia State Water Control Board.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
    The Companies businesses are influenced by many factors that are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties that may materially affect actual
results and are often beyond the Companies  control. A number of these risk factors have been identified in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which should be taken into consideration when
reviewing the information contained in this report. There have been no material changes with regard to the risk factors previously disclosed in the Companies  Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. For other
factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement or projection contained in this report, see  Forward-Looking Statements  in MD A in this report.

case Series E Senior Notes in definitive form will be printed and delivered to the Depositary, or (iii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing with respect to the Series E Senior Notes. Any Global Security that is exchangeable
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Series E Senior Notes registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct.  
 SECTION 106.  Redemption . The Series E Senior Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at the
option of the Company, at a Redemption Price equal to the greater of:    (i) 100% of the principal amount of Series E Senior Notes then
Outstanding to be so redeemed, or    (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest on the
Series E Senior Notes to be redeemed (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the Redemption Date) discounted to the Redemption Date on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at
the Adjusted Treasury Rate, plus 15 basis points, as calculated by an Independent Investment Banker,

                       Dollars ($          )] [specified in Schedule I hereto]** on
September 30, 2018 and to pay interest thereon from September 28, 2016 or from the most recent Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, semi-annually in arrears on March 30 and September 30 of
each year, commencing on March 30, 2017, at the rate of 1.50% per annum, until the principal hereof is paid or made available for payment, provided that any principal, and any such installment of interest, that is overdue shall bear
interest at the rate of 1.50% per annum (to the extent that the payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable), from the dates such amounts are due until they are paid or made available for payment, and such interest shall be payable on
demand. The interest so payable, and punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in such Indenture, be paid to the Person in whose name this Series E Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is
registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest; provided that the interest payable at Stated Maturity or on a Redemption Date will be paid to the Person to whom principal is payable. The Regular Record Date shall be
the close of business on the Business Day preceding such Interest Payment Date; provided, that with respect to Series E Senior Notes that are not represented by one or more Global Securities, the Regular Record Date shall be the close of business on
the fifteenth (15 th ) calendar day (whether or not a Business Day) preceding such Interest Payment Date. Any such interest not so punctually paid or duly provided for will forthwith cease to
be payable to the Holder on such Regular Record Date and may either be paid to the Person in whose name this Series E Senior Note (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment
of such Defaulted Interest to be fixed by the Trustee, notice whereof shall be given to Holders of Series E Senior Notes not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date, or be paid at any time in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with
the requirements of any securities exchange on which the Series E Senior Notes may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, all as more fully provided in said Indenture.  
 Payments of interest on the Series E Senior Notes will include interest accrued to but excluding the respective Interest Payment Dates.
Interest payments for the Series E Senior Notes shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months. In the event that any date on which interest is payable on the Series E Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then
payment of the interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or payment in respect of any such delay), in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the
payment was originally payable.    Payment of the principal of and interest on this Series E Senior Note will be made at the office of the
Paying Agent, in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, in such coin or currency of the United States of America as at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private debts, with any such payment that is due at
the Stated Maturity of any Series E Senior Note, upon redemption or repurchase being made upon surrender of such Series E Senior Note to such office or agency; provided, however, that at the option of the Company payment of interest, subject to such
surrender where applicable, may be made (i) by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall appear in the Security Register or (ii) by wire transfer at such place and to such account at a banking
institution in the United States as may be designated in writing to the Trustee at least sixteen (16) days

prior to the date for payment by the Person entitled thereto. In the event that any date on which principal and interest is payable on the Series E Senior Notes is not a Business Day, then
payment of the principal and interest payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or payment in respect of any such delay), in each such case with the same force and effect as if made

[REVERSE OF 2016 SERIES E 1.50% SENIOR NOTE]   
 This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of securities of the Company (herein called the  Securities ), issued and to be
issued in one or more series under an Indenture dated as of June 1, 2015 (the  Base Indenture ), between the Company and Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Trustee (the  Trustee ), as heretofore supplemented and as
further supplemented by a Seventh Supplemental Indenture dated as of September 1, 2016 (the  Seventh Supplemental Indenture  and, together with the Base Indenture, as it may be hereafter supplemented or amended from time to time, the
 Indenture,  which term shall have the meaning assigned to it in such instrument), by and between the Company and the Trustee, and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations of rights,
duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is one of the series designated on the face
hereof (the  Series E Senior Notes ) which is unlimited in aggregate principal amount.    The Series E Senior Notes are
redeemable, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.    If an
Event of Default with respect to Series E Senior Notes shall occur and be continuing, the principal of the Series E Senior Notes may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.  
 The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations
of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee for the series of Securities affected, with the consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount of the Securities of each series at the time
Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Series E Senior Note shall be conclusive and binding
upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Series E Senior Note and of any Series E Senior Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is
made upon this Series E Senior Note.    As provided in and subject to the provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of this Series E Senior
Note shall not have the right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously given the Trustee written notice of
a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Series E Senior Notes, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Series E Senior Notes at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the Trustee to institute
proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it, and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in principal amount of Series E Senior
Notes at the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and shall have failed to institute any such  
      5  

proceeding for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Holder of this Series E Senior Note for the
enforcement of any payment of principal hereof or premium, if any, or interest hereon on or after the respective due dates expressed or provided for herein.  
 No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Series E Senior Note or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of
the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Series E Senior Note at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency, herein prescribed.  
 As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Series E Senior Note is registrable in
the Security Register, upon surrender of this Series E Senior Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Company in any place where the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on this Series E Senior Note are payable, duly
endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new Series E
Senior Notes of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.  
 The Series E Senior Notes are issuable only in registered form without coupons in denominations of $2,000 and any greater integral multiple of
$1,000. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Series E Senior Notes are exchangeable for a like aggregate principal amount of Series E Senior Notes having the same Stated Maturity and of like tenor of any
authorized denominations as requested by the Holder upon surrender of the Series E Senior Note or Series E Senior Notes to be exchanged at the office or agency of the Company.  
 No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to
cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.    Prior to due presentment of this Series E Senior Note for
registration of transfer, the Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Series E Senior Note be overdue,
and neither the Company, the Trustee nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.    All terms used in this Series E
Senior Note that are defined in the Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

Exhibit 12.1   
  Dominion Resources, Inc. and Subsidiaries      Computation
of Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges     (millions of dollars)      

(a) 
 Earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include $65 million charge associated with an organizational design initiative; $60 million in transaction and transition costs associated with the Dominion
Questar combination; $18 million charge related to other items; partially offset by $29 million of net gain related to our investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Excluding the effect of these items from the calculation would result in a
higher ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    

(b) 
 Earnings for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 include $65 million charge associated with an organizational design initiative; $60 million in transaction and transition costs associated with the Dominion
Questar combination; $54 million charge associated with ash pond and landfill closure costs; $82 million charge related to other items; partially offset by $50 million of net gain related to our investments in nuclear decommissioning trust.
Excluding the effect of these items from the calculation would result in a higher ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016.    

(c) 
 Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 include $85 million write-off of prior-period deferred fuel costs associated with Virginia legislation; $99 million charge associated with ash pond and
landfill closure costs and $78 million charge related to other items; partially offset by $60 million of net gain related to our investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Excluding the effect of these items from the calculation would
result in a higher ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015.    

(d) 
 Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 include $374 million charge related to North Anna and offshore wind facilities; $284 million charge associated with our liability management effort, which is
included in fixed charges; $121 million accrued charge associated with ash pond and landfill closure costs; $93 million charge related to other items; partially offset by $100 million net gain on the sale of our electric retail energy marketing
business and $72 million of net gain related to our investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds. Excluding the effect of these items from the calculation would result in a higher ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the twelve months ended
December 31, 2014.    

(e) 
 Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 include a $55 million impairment charge related to certain natural gas infrastructure assets; $40 million charge in connection with the Virginia
Commission s final ruling associated with its biennial review of Virginia Power s base rates for 2011-2012 test years; $28 million charge associated with our operating expense reduction initiative, primarily reflecting severance pay and
other employee related costs; $26 million charge related to the expected early shutdown of certain coal-fired generating units; $29 million charge related to other items ; partially offset by $81 million of net gain related to our investments in
nuclear decommissioning trust funds; $47 million benefit due to a downward revision in the nuclear decommissioning asset retirement obligations for certain merchant nuclear units that are no longer in service; $29 million net benefit primarily
resulting from the sale of Elwood. Excluding the net effect of these items from the calculation would result in a higher ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013.    

(f) 
 Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 include $438 million of impairment and other charges related the planned shut-down of Kewaunee; $87 million of restoration costs associated with severe storms
affecting our Dominion Virginia Power and Dominion North Carolina service territories; partially offset by a $36 million net gain related to our investments in nuclear decommissioning trust funds and $4 million net benefit related to other items.
Excluding the net effect of these items from the calculation would result in a higher ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2012.    

(g) 
 Earnings for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011 include $228 million of impairment charges related to electric utility generation assets; $96 million of restoration costs associated with Hurricane Irene; $43
million impairment of excess emission allowances resulting from a new EPA Air Pollution Rule; $31 million net charge in connection with the Virginia State Corporation Commission s final ruling associated with its biennial review of Virginia
Power s base rates for 2009 and 2010 test years; $21 million of earthquake related costs, largely related to inspections following the safe shutdown of reactors at our North Anna nuclear power station; and a $45 million net charge related to
other items; partially offset by a $24 million benefit related to litigation with the Department of Energy for spent nuclear fuel-related costs at our Millstone nuclear power station. Excluding the net effect of these items from the calculation
would result in a higher ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the twelve months ended December 31, 2011.
