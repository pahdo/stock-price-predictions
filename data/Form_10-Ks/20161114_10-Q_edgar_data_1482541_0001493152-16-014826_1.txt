CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Form 10-Q ) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ),
and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). All statements contained
in this Form 10-Q other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding our future results of operations and
financial position, our business strategy and plans, and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements.
The words  believe,   may,   will,   estimate,   continue,   anticipate, 
 intend,   expect,  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We have
based these forward-looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and trends that
we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short-term and long-term business operations
and objectives, and financial needs. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, and assumptions,
including those described in the section entitled  Risk Factors  in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015, as updated from time to time in the Company s filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  SEC ). Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge
from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on
our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from
those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, the future
events and trends discussed in this Form 10-Q may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those
anticipated or implied in the forward-looking statements.  

We
undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except
as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking
statements.  

Unless
expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms  Surna,  the  Company,   we, 
 us,  and  our  in this Form 10-Q refer to Surna Inc., a Nevada corporation, and, where appropriate, its
wholly owned subsidiary.

NOTE
1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Company:   

Surna
Inc. ( Company   we   us  or  our ) incorporated in the State of Nevada on October
15, 2009. On March 26, 2014, we acquired Safari Resource Group, Inc. ( Safari ), a Nevada corporation, whereby we
became the sole surviving corporation after the acquisition of Safari. On July 25, 2014, we acquired 100% of the membership interest
in Hydro Innovations, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ( Hydro ), pursuant to which Hydro became a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company.  

We
engineer and manufacture innovative technology and products that address the energy and resource intensive nature of indoor cultivation.
Our focus lies in supplying industrial solutions to commercial indoor cannabis cultivation facilities. Our engineering team is
tasked with creating novel energy and resource efficient solutions, including our signature liquid-cooled climate control platform.
Our engineers continuously seek to create technologies that allow growers to easily meet the highly specific demands of a cannabis
cultivation environment through temperature, humidity, light, and process control. Our objective is to provide intelligent solutions
that improve the quality, control, and overall yield and efficiency of indoor cannabis cultivation. We are headquartered in Boulder,
Colorado.  

The
Company s operations exclude the production or sale of marijuana.  

Financial
Statement Presentation:   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q
and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Pursuant to these rules and regulations, certain information and note disclosures, normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, have been condensed or omitted. GAAP requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring items) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements
at that date, but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. For
further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. The notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are presented on
a continuing basis unless otherwise noted.  

Basis
of Consolidation and Reclassifications:   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its controlled and wholly-owned subsidiary.
Intercompany transactions, profits, and balances are eliminated in consolidation.  

Certain
reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior periods to conform to the current period presentation. All reclassifications
have been applied consistently to the periods presented. The reclassifications had no impact on net loss or total assets and liabilities.  

Use
of Estimates:   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from
other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, any change in these estimates or their related assumptions
could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Key estimates include: valuation of derivative liabilities, valuation of
intangible assets, and valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements:   

In
August 2016, the accounting standard update related to the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments was issued.
This standard update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice.
The amendments in this update are effective as of the first quarter of 2018; however, early adoption is permitted. We are currently
evaluating the impact that this standard update will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
June 2016, the standard update related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments was issued. This standard
update requires financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
This standard update is effective as of the first quarter of 2020; however, early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating
the impact that this standard update will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
May 2016, accounting guidance was issued to clarify the not yet effective revenue recognition guidance issued in May 2014. This
additional guidance does not change the core principle of the revenue recognition guidance issued in May 2014, rather, it provides
clarification of accounting for collections of sales taxes as well as recognition of revenue (i) associated with contract modifications,
(ii) for noncash consideration, and (iii) based on the collectability of the consideration from the customer. The guidance also
specifies when a contract should be considered  completed  for purposes of applying the transition guidance. The effective
date and transition requirements for this guidance are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for the guidance
previously issued in 2014, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The Company
has not yet determined the impact that this new guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2016, accounting guidance was issued pertaining to identifying performance obligations in contracts with customers and improving
the operability and understandability of licensing implementation guidance. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The Company has not yet determined the impact of this new guidance on its condensed consolidated
financial statements.  

In
March 2016, accounting guidance was issued to improve the accounting for employee stock-based payments. The guidance simplifies
accounting for stock-based award transactions specific to income tax consequences, the classification of awards as equity or liabilities,
and the classification of award payments on the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods
beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this new guidance
will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, accounting guidance was issued to clarify the application of previously issued revenue recognition guidance related
to whether an entity is a principal or an agent. More specifically, this new guidance clarifies that the analysis must focus on
whether the entity has control of the goods or services before they are transferred to the customer and provides additional guidance
about how to apply the control principle when services are provided and when goods or services are combined with other goods or
services. The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The Company has not
yet determined the impact that this new guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, accounting guidance was issued pertaining to accounting for derivatives and hedging activity. The guidance amends
existing GAAP by clarifying that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging
instrument does not, in and of itself, require de-designation of that hedging relationship, provided that all other hedge accounting
criteria continue to be met. The amendment improves prior guidance by eliminating diversity in practice. The guidance is effective
for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The guidance may be applied prospectively or using a modified
retrospective approach to adjust retained earnings. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its condensed
consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, additional accounting guidance was issued pertaining to accounting for derivatives and hedging activity. The guidance
clarifies the steps required when assessing whether the economic characteristics and risks of call (put) options are clearly and
closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of their debt hosts, which is one of the criteria for bifurcating an
embedded derivative. Consequently, when a call (put) option is contingently exercisable, an entity does not have to assess whether
the event that triggers the ability to exercise a call (put) option is related to interest rates or credit risks. The amendment
improves prior guidance by eliminating diversity in practice in assessing embedded contingent call (put) options in debt instruments.
The guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently assessing
the impact that the adoption of this new guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, accounting guidance was issued pertaining to leases to increase transparency and comparability among organizations
by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.
The core principle of this guidance is that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability)
and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The guidance is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption
of this new guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial.  

In
January 2016, accounting guidance was issued on the classification and measurement of financial assets and liabilities (equity
securities and financial liabilities) under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial
instruments. The guidance modifies how an entity measures equity investments and presents changes in the fair value of financial
liabilities. Under the new guidance, an entity will have to measure at fair value those equity investments that do not result
in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method, and an entity will have to recognize any changes in fair value
in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicality exception. That exception will apply to those equity investments
that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value under
the guidance, and, as such, these investments may be measured at cost. The guidance will be effective on January 1, 2018. The
Company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of this new guidance will have on its condensed consolidated financial
statements.  

We continually assess
any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability to us. Where it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement
affects our financial reporting, we undertake a study to determine the consequence of the change to our financial statements and
assure that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that our financial statements properly reflect the change. We have
evaluated all other GAAP issued through the date the condensed consolidated financials were issued and believe that the
adoption of these will not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE
2 - GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.  

In
the course of its development activities, the Company has sustained and continues to sustain losses. The Company cannot predict
if or when the Company will generate profits. The Company has a deficit in working capital of approximately $4,149,668 as of September
30, 2016. Additionally, the Company has generated cumulative net losses of approximately $13,182,018 during the period from inception
through September 30, 2016.  

The
Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue
as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern depends on it obtaining the adequate capital to
fund operating losses until it becomes profitable. Management plans to continue as a going concern to achieve a profitable level
of operations including generating cash through increased product sales, reducing planned expenditures, if necessary, and raising
capital from investors. While management plans to take the steps necessary to extend the time period over which the then-available
resources would be able to fund the operations, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in
accomplishing any of its plans. Additionally, there can be no assurance that, if such efforts are successful, the terms and conditions
of such financing will be favorable. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, we raised a total of approximately $1,781,000 in connection with issuances of three series of
convertible promissory notes. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we raised approximately $2,962,000 in connection with issuances
of two series of convertible promissory notes ( Notes ). The Notes become due and payable starting in November 2016
through February 2017. The Company has been in discussion with several investment firms and is evaluating the Company s
options for additional funding. Also, the Compan y has begun  negotiations with the
holders of the Notes to determine a mutual agreement to retire the Notes and amend associated warrants. As of the issuance of
these condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has not entered into any agreements. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish its plans and eventually secure other
sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
3 - NOTES RECEIVABLE   

On April 26, 2016, the
Company entered into a non-binding letter of intent ( LOI ) to acquire substantially all of the assets of a third
party ( Seller ). Per the terms of the Agreement, Company and Seller endeavored to close the transaction before
August 31, 2016, which was extended to September 30, 2016 ( Exclusivity Period ). Although the Exclusivity
Period has terminated, the Company is still in the due diligence phase. During the Exclusivity Period, the Company was required
to provide the Seller a loan in the amount of $20,000 per month, up to a maximum of $80,000, which has been advanced as of September
30, 2016. The Company has changed its intent from acquiring the Company as a whole to acquiring certain assets and patents, which
don t constitute a business, from the Seller. 

NOTE
4 - CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTES   

During
the first six months of 2016, approximately $890,000 of convertible promissory notes were converted into 17,888,828 shares of
the Company s common stock. The remaining balance of our convertible promissory notes as of September 30, 2016 of approximately
$2,280,000 (after debt discounts of approximately $256,000) relates to our Convertible Series 2 issuance.  

NOTE
5 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

There
have been no significant events occurring after September 30, 2016.  

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The following discussion
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, which include additional information about our accounting
policies, practices, and the transactions underlying our financial results, as well as with our audited consolidated financial
statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC. In addition
to our historical unaudited condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements
that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form
10-Q, particularly in Part II, Item 1A,  Risk Factors.   

Overview   

Surna
develops, designs, and distributes cultivation technologies for controlled environment agriculture ( CEA ). The Company s
customers include state-regulated cannabis cultivation facilities as well as traditional indoor agricultural facilities, including
organic herb and vegetable producers. Surna s technologies include a comprehensive line of optimized lighting, environmental
control, air sanitation, and cultivation facilities. These technologies are designed to meet the specific environmental conditions
required for CEA and dramatically reduce energy and water consumption.  

In
addition, Surna offers mechanical design services specific to hydronic cooling, including mechanical equipment and piping design.  

Recent
Developments   

In the six months preceding
September 30, 2016 we have been focused on further developing the fundamentals of our business. In 2015 we experienced manufacturing
related problems, as previously reported. In 2016 we have been heavily focused on ensuring that our products not only meet but
exceed customer expectations. We have focused on reducing costs, streamlining our operations, and ensuring our leadership role
in developing energy efficient products in the cannabis cultivation; whilst also ensuring that any residual problems have been
resolved. We believe we have built a strong team that will position the Company to be successful in the cannabis industry. Our
current and future revenue plan is dependent on the continued and increasing legality of the cannabis industry and our ability
to effectively market our indoor agriculture products to this key segment as well as expand our reach to other markets. As the
legal cannabis industry is still in its infancy, we also expect further revenues to be derived from existing markets as they age
and increase the sophistication of production. 

On November 8, 2016,
eight states expanded the legalization of cannabis: 4 states initiated medicinal use and 4 states expanded use to incorporate
adult recreational   this included California, which in itself will increase availability to nearly 40 million people. This
massive expansion creates the need for cultivation technologies   like Surna s climate controls and Hybrid Building
  to help the industry run efficiently and responsibly. As each state has a unique climate, growing environment and regulations,
we believe our expertise will be key for developing tailored solutions. To date, states have taken approximately 18 to 24 months
to implement rules and regulations, issue licenses and come online. However, it is possible the process may shorten for those
states that have medicinal and are simply expanding into adult recreational use. This remains to be seen. Regardless, during the
transition, we will establish our regional sales organization and continue to
invest in production, engineering and new technologies. Our focus for the remainder of 2016 and 2017 is on sales and execution. 

Critical
Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates   

This discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Certain accounting
policies are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require
the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic
factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In
applying these policies, management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination
of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial
results, the terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers, and information
available from other outside sources, as appropriate. For information regarding the Company s critical accounting policies
as well as recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. 

Results
of Operations   

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes
included in this form 10-Q  

Comparison
of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenues
and Cost of Goods Sold   

Revenue for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $1,171,000 compared to $3,634,000 for the same period in 2015 (68% decrease). A significant
portion of our revenues for 2015 were derived from growers in the State of Nevada (legalized cannabis in 2014), which peaked in
the third quarter of 2015. As our sales quarter over quarter for 2016 have been declining, our contractual sales commitments have
been increasing. The sales amounts that we had under contract but not yet completed have increased quarter over quarter of 2016
from $1,662,000 (as of March 31, 2016), $2,310,000 (as of June 30, 2016) and $4,074,000 (as of September 30, 2016). Our contractual
sales commitments increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to our customers having experienced increased
delays in completing the construction of their facilities to accept their product. Our contractual sales cannot be canceled by
our customers. Initially our sales contracts were dependent upon our customers  ability to secure, license and build their
growing facilities and thus our revenue recognition was dependent upon shipping and our customers  ability to receive the
product. We have seen an increased delay in the time frames in which our customers have been able to receive the product, most
likely related to the increasing size of our projects. This factor has slowed our revenue recognition and increased our contractual
sales commitments. Beginning in October 2016, all of our sales contracts will be Freight On Board Shipping. This removes any dependencies
on our revenue recognition being tied to a customer s ability to receive product. 

Cost of revenue
has decreased by 76% from $3,125,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $754,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016. The gross margin increased by 22% from 14% in 2015 to 36% 2016 due to (i) negotiation of favorable
pricing with key suppliers or sourcing new suppliers, (ii) a sales mix that consisted of high margin products and (iii) reduced
spend on installation projects as we no longer provide installation services. 

Operating
expenses have decreased by 38% from $1,049,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $654,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016. We have decreased advertising and marketing expenses by 90% from $149,000 for 2015 to $14,000
for 2016 due to a heavier emphasis on advertising in the prior year and a focus on reigning in costs in the current year. We decreased
product development costs by 68% from $224,000 in 2015 to $72,000 in 2016 due to the product life cycle of the Surna reflector
product, which has moved from development stage in the first quarter of 2015 to production stage in the first quarter of 2016.
Also in 2015, we were developing the Surna Hybrid Building, which is being launched to the market at the Marijuana Daily Conference
in November 2016. We decreased general and administrative expenses by 16% from $676,000 in 2015 to $568,000 in 2016 due to reductions
in personnel cost of approximately $55,000 as well as a focus on cost containment related other expense of approximately $69,000
which were offset with an increase of approximately $16,000 for travel expenses.  

Other expenses have decreased
by 46% from $795,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $432,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016. This is result of the decrease in interest expense and debt discount on convertible promissory notes, which
was a result of the conversion of certain convertible promissory notes converted in the first quarter and second quarter of 2016. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no federal taxable income due to utilization of net operating loss
carryforwards for the current quarter and operating losses in the second quarter of 2015.  

Overall,
we realized a net loss of approximately $669,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of approximately
$1,335,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Comparison
of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $5,561,000 compared to $6,183,000 for the same period in 2015 (10%
decrease). A significant portion of our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were derived from growers in the
State of Nevada (legalized cannabis in 2014), which peaked in the third quarter of 2015. As our sales quarter over quarter for
2016 have been declining, our contractual sales commitments have been increasing. The sales amounts that we had under contract
but not yet completed have increased quarter over quarter of 2016 from $1,662,000 (as of March 31, 2016), $2,310,000 (as of June
30, 2016) and $4,074,000 (as of September 30, 2016). Our contractual sales commitments have increased during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, due to our customers having experienced increased delays in finalizing their facilities to accept their product.
Our contractual sales cannot be canceled by our customers. Initially our sales contracts were dependent upon our customers 
ability to secure, license and build their growing facilities and thus our revenue recognition was dependent upon shipping and
our customers  ability to receive the product. We have seen an increased delay in the time frames in which our customers
have been able to receive the product, most likely related to the increasing size of our projects. This factor has slowed our
revenue recognition and increased our contractual sales commitments. Beginning in October 2016 , all of our sales contracts will
be Fright On Board Shipping. This removes any dependencies on our revenue recognition being tied to a customer s ability
to receive product.  

Cost of revenue
has decreased by 30% from $5,338,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $3,741,000 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016. Gross margin in 2016 increased by 19% from 14% in 2015 to to 33% in 2016 due to several factors
including: (i) a warranty charge of approximately $455,000 the Company recorded during the three month end June 30, 2016
for an estimated cost to replace a customer s system (ii) offset by price increases that took effect late in the third quarter
of 2015, (ii) negotiation of favorable pricing with key suppliers or sourcing new suppliers, (iii) a sales mix that consisted
of high margin products and (iv) reduced spend on installation projects as we no longer provide installation services. 

Operating expenses have
decreased by 33% from $2,955,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to approximately $1,991,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. Advertising and marketing expenses decreased by 82% from $324,000 for 2015 to $57,000 2016 due to a heavier
emphasis on advertising in the prior year and a focus on reigning in costs in the current year. Product development costs decreased
by 49% from $534,000 in 2015 to $272,000 in 2016 due to the product life cycle of the Surna reflector product, which has moved
from development stage in the first quarter of 2015 to production stage in the first quarter of 2016. Also in 2015, we were developing
the Surna Hybrid Building, which is being launched into the market at the at the Marijuana Daily Conference in November 2016. We
have decreased general and administrative expenses by 21% from $2,097,000 in 2015 to $1,662,000 in 2016 due to reductions in the
following expenses: personnel cost of approximately $102,000, travel expense of approximately $59,000, professional fees of approximately
$232,000 as well as a focus on cost containment related other expense of approximately of $105,000 which were offset with an increase
of approximately $64,000 for contract labor and sales expense. 

We incurred net other
expenses of $1,947,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,620,000 (a 20% increase) for the same period
in 2015. The increase in total other expense was due in part to loss on change in derivative liabilities and an increase in interest
expense, which were offset by a marginal decrease in amortization of debt discount on convertible promissory notes. The increase
of the market price for the Company s common stock increased during the first and third quarters of 2016, which resulted
in a loss on change in derivatives of approximately $484,000, which was offset by an approximate gain of $135,000 during the second
quarter of 2016, as compared to an approximate gain of $475,000 for the same period in 2015. 

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had no federal taxable income due to utilization of net operating loss carryforwards
for the each of period.  

Overall,
we realized a net loss of approximately $2,118,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a net loss of approximately
$3,731,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which is a 43% reduction in our net loss.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

The
following summarizes our cash flows:  

We
have never reported net income. We incurred net losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and have an accumulated
deficit of approximately $13,182,000 as of September 30, 2016. We had working capital deficits (current liabilities exceed current
assets) of approximately $4,149,000 and $3,020,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We have not been
able to generate sufficient cash from operating activities to fund our ongoing operations. Since our inception, we have raised
capital through private sales of common stock and debt securities. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to achieve
profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate enough
revenue and/or raise capital to support our operations. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a cash balance
of approximately $235,000 and $331,000, respectively.  

Cash
Requirements    

Our
ability to fund our growth and meet our obligations on a timely basis is dependent on our ability to match our available financial
resources to our growth strategy, which includes acquisitions for cash or a combination of cash and debt. The decisions we make
with regard to acquisitions drive the level of capital required and the level of our financial obligations. Management has determined
the Company s September 30, 2016 cash balance of approximately $235,000 will not be sufficient to fund the Company s
operations over the next twelve months. Based on management s estimate for operational cash requirements and without modifications
to our existing payment obligations, which including, among other things, the upcoming payments for the convertible promissory
notes maturing from October 31, 2016 through the end of the quarter ending March 31, 2017, or receipt of additional funding, we
will require additional capital to continue our operations beyond December 2016. We are currently negotiating with holders of
notes which are maturing with a goal of converting the notes into equity and reducing the exercise prices of associated warrants.
As of the filing of this Form 10-Q, we have not finalized any negotiation and there is no assurance we will be able to successfully
negotiate these conversions and avoid default on the notes.  

If
we are unable to generate cash flow from operations, adjustment to our payment arrangements or from successfully raising sufficient
additional capital through future debt and equity financings or strategic and collaborative ventures with potential partners,
we would likely have to reduce the size and scope of our operations. Our officers and shareholders have not made any written or
oral agreement to provide us additional financing. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to raise capital
on terms and conditions that are deemed acceptable to us.  

Operating
Activities    

Cash
provided by operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $35,000 compared to cash used in operations
of approximately $1,297,000 for the same period in 2015.   The fluctuation was due to the reduction in the recorded net loss
and collection of our accounts receivable and maintaining lowering levels of inventory, which have been offset with the use of
cash to lower our accounts payable balance.  

Investing
Activities    

Cash
provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $15,000 compared to cash used
by investing activities of approximately $158,000 for the period in 2015. This fluctuation reflects the $135,000 of cash loaned
to a company in 2015 and the $100,000 cash receipt against the note receivable from Agrisoft in 2016. Also, in 2016 we loaned
approximately $80,000 in connection with a potential acquisition.  

Financing
Activities    

Cash used in financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $145,000 compared to cash provided by financing activities
of approximately $1,744,000 for the same period in 2015. No debt was issued in 2016 period compared to the $1,860,000 off
convertible promissory note issuances in the comparable prior in 2015. During the 2016 period, we paid of a vehicle loan in the
amount of approximately $34,000 and payments of approximately $111,000 on outstanding promissory notes. 

Inflation    

In
the opinion of management, inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations in the immediate future. Management
will continue to monitor inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business and operations.  

Contractual
Payment Obligations    

We
have obligations under notes payable and an irrevocable operating lease. As of September 30, 2016, these contractual obligations
totaled approximately $3,112,000.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

There
are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources
that is material to investors.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK   

We
are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under
this item.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer ( CEO ) and principal financial and accounting officer
( PFAO ), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our CEO
and PFAO concluded that, because of certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as described
in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC, our disclosure controls
and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act were not effective as of as of September 30,
2016.  

The
Company did not maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the financial reporting process because we lacked a sufficient
complement of personnel with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate
with our financial reporting requirements. In addition, there was inadequate segregation of duties due to the limitation on the
number of our accounting personnel.  

We
intend to take appropriate and reasonable steps to make the necessary improvements to remediate these deficiencies. However, due
to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible and may not be economically feasible.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

For
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

The
Company is not presently a party to any material legal proceedings, nor is the Company aware of any pending or threatened litigation
that would have a material adverse effect on the Company s business, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition
should such litigation be resolved unfavorably.  

Item
1A. Risk Factors

in our other reports and periodic filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, the risk factors contained under the caption
 Item 1A Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 that could materially
and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The risk factors discussed in that Form 10-K
do not identify all risks that we face because our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not
presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. There have been no material changes in
the significant factors that may affect our business and operations as described in  Item 1A Risk Factors  of
the Annual Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Rule
13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) Certification   

I,
Trent Doucet, certify that:  

1.
I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 of Surna Inc. (the  registrant );  

2.
Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  

3.
Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all
material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods
presented in this report;  

4.
The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  

a.
Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly
during the period in which this report is being prepared;

reporting; and

internal control over financial reporting.

on its main product offerings - supplying industrial technology and products to commercial indoor cannabis grow
facilities.  

Headquartered
in Boulder, CO, Surna s diverse engineering team is tasked with creating novel energy and resource efficient solutions,
including the Company s signature water-cooled climate control platform. The Company s engineers continuously seek
to create technology that solve the highly specific demands of the cannabis industry for temperature, humidity, light and process

goal is to provide intelligent solutions to improve the quality, the control and the overall yield and efficiency of CEA. Though
its clients do, the Company neither produces nor sells cannabis.  

Safe
Harbor Statement   

This
news release contains statements that involve expectations, plans or intentions (such as those relating to future business or
financial results, new features or services, or management strategies) and other factors discussed from time to time in the Company s
Securities and Exchange Commission filings. These statements are forward-looking and are subject to risks and uncertainties, so
actual results may vary materially. You can identify these forward-looking statements by words such as  may,   should, 
 expect,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   intend,   plan 
and other similar expressions. Our actual results, such as the Company s ability to finance, complete and consolidate acquisition
of IP, assets and operating companies, could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a
result of certain factors not within the control of the company such as a result of various factors, including future economic,
competitive, regulatory, and market conditions. The company cautions readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date made. The company disclaims any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or
unanticipated events.  

Statement
About Cannabis Markets   

The
use, possession, cultivation, and distribution of cannabis is prohibited by federal law. This includes medical and recreational
cannabis. Although certain states have legalized medical and recreational cannabis, companies and individuals involved in the
sector are still at risk of being prosecuted by federal authorities. Further, the landscape in the cannabis industry changes rapidly.
What was the law last week is not the law today and what is the law today may not be the law next week. This means that at any
time the city, county, or state where cannabis is permitted can change the current laws and/or the federal government can supersede
those laws and take prosecutorial action. Given the uncertain legal nature of the cannabis industry, it is imperative that investors
understand that the cannabis industry is a high-risk investment. A change in the current laws or enforcement policy can negatively
affect the status and operation of our business, require additional fees, stricter operational guidelines and unanticipated shut-downs.

Surna
Inc. Reports Third Quarter 2016 Financial Results   

BOULDER,
CO   Nov. 14, 2016   Surna Inc. (OTCQB: SRNA), a technology company that engineers equipment for controlled environment
agriculture (CEA) with special expertise in cannabis cultivation, reported its financial results for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016.  

Last
week, eight states, including California, initiated legalization of cannabis or expanded their status to include adult recreational
use. This is expected to fuel tremendous growth in the CEA equipment market as these states come online in the next few years, 
stated Surna s President and Chief Executive Officer Trent Doucet.  To prepare for this significant increase in demand,
we have been strengthening our foundation by improving our infrastructure, customer service policies and project management procedures.
Through more efficient cost management, in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, we increased our gross
margin, improved our bottom line and grew our deferred revenue, even though our revenue decreased primarily due to delays in customer
readiness to acceptance equipment.  

We
are gaining recognition with our energy-efficient solutions coupled with our expertise in climate conditions necessary for optimal
product yield. As energy is one of the largest cultivation operating expenses, we believe our technology will provide a significant
competitive advantage as the market continues to grow dramatically. Additionally, we are in the process of establishing a regional
sales organization and creating recurring revenue streams via service contracts. To that end, we are developing dynamic, proactive
management systems to optimize energy usage, maximize equipment reliability, and leverage intelligent equipment that can be easily
automated to reliably cultivate crops. Further, we expect to leverage our relationship with Surna-only Sterling Pharms to demonstrate
our products and technology. We are very excited about our progress and the expanding opportunity.   

ISIDEO,
a LEEDs certified consultant, estimated, using a simulation of the current Surna model, the Hybrid Building may be able to reduce
energy by 60% over the course of a year over traditional cultivation. A scale of the Hybrid Building will be exhibited in booth
329 at the Marijuana Business Conference   Expo  in Las Vegas from November 16 to 18.  

Results
for Third Quarter: 2016 Compared to 2015   

Revenue
    was $1.2 million, compared to $3.6 million, primarily due to delays in customer readiness to acceptance equipment. Surna continues
    to expect quarterly sales will fluctuate due primarily to the timing of state legislation, procedural set up, licensing and
    general availability.    

Cost
    of revenue was $754,000, compared to $3.1 million, due to lower sales and the more efficient cost and supply chain management.

Gross
    margin increased to 35.6%, compared to 14.0%.   

Operating
    expenses decreased to $654,000, compared to $1.0 million.    

Balance
Sheet Highlights    

Cash
on hand was $235,000 at September 30, 2016, compared to $331,000 at December 31, 2015. Deferred revenue increased to $1.4 million
at September 30, 2016, from $986,000 at December 31, 2015.  

Subsequent
to quarter end, on October 31, Surna began private negotiations with certain holders of certain 10% convertible promissory notes
and warrants with the goal of reducing indebtedness. Surna anticipates reporting on the results of these negotiations when they
are completed.  

Results
for First Nine Months: 2016 Compared to 2015   

Revenue
was $5.6 million, compared to $6.2 million. Gross margin, which included the impact of the $455,000 warranty charge in the second
quarter, increased to 32.7%, compared to 13.7%. Net loss was $2.1 million, or $0.02 per share, compared to $3.7 million, or $0.03
per share.

This
press release contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company s future business expectations, which are subject
to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are only
