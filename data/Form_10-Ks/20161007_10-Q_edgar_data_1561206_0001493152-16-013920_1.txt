1.   
       Interim
    Reporting    

While the information
presented in the accompanying interim nine months financial statements is unaudited, it includes all adjustments, which are, in
the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim
periods presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These interim financial
statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of their application as the Company s November 30, 2015 annual
financial statements. All adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. It is suggested that these interim financial statements
be read in conjunction with the Company s November 30, 2015 annual financial statements. 

Operating results
for the nine months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the year ended
November 30, 2016. 

2   
       Organization
    and nature of operations    

OnePower Systems
Ltd. ( the Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada, USA on August 28, 2009. The Company is in its early
development stage since its formation and has not realized any revenues from its planned operations. The Company is engaged in
the development of electronic bill delivery and payment systems that will enable vendors the abilities to present bills and receive
payments electronically. 

The Company has
chosen a November 30 year end. 

3.   
       Going
    concern uncertainties    

These financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which contemplate
continuation of the Company as a going concern. However, the Company has limited operations and has sustained operating losses
resulting in a deficit. In view of these matters, operating as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to
meet its financing requirements, and the success of its future operations. 

The Company has
accumulated a deficit of $111,477 since inception, has yet to achieve profitable operations and further losses are anticipated
in the development of its business. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is in substantial doubt and is
dependent upon obtaining additional financing and/or achieving a sustainable profitable level of operations. The financial statements
do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company may seek additional equity
as necessary and it expects to raise funds through private or public equity investment in order to support existing operations
and expand the range of its business. There is no assurance that such additional funds will be available for the Company on acceptable
terms, if at all. 

4.   
       Summary
    of principal accounting policies     

A summary of the
significant accounting policies applied in the presentation of the accompanying financial statements follows:

       Summary
    of principal accounting policies (continued)    

Recently issued
accounting pronouncements   

The Company adopts
new pronouncements relating to generally accepted accounting principles applicable to the Company as they are issued, which may
be in advance of their effective date. Management does not believe that any pronouncement not yet effective but recently issued
by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA or the SEC would, if adopted, have a material effect on the
accompanying financial statements. 

5.  
       Common
    stock    

There were no
non-cash transactions during the periods ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015. 

6.   
       Convertible
    Notes Payable    

The Company has
six convertible notes payable. The notes are non-interest bearing, unsecured and payable on demand. At any time prior to repayment
any portion of the entire note may be converted into common stock at the discretion of the holder on the basis of $0.055 of debt
to 1 share. The effect that conversion would have on earnings per share has not been disclosed due to the current anti-dilutive
effect. 

The common stock
of the Company has been issued at $0.055 per share for operations. The conversion rate of $0.055 creates a zero conversion benefit
at current stock prices. Therefore, no beneficial conversion factor has been recorded.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION    

GENERAL  

OnePower
Systems Ltd.  was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on August 28, 2009. Our registration statement on
Form S-1 was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission was declared effective on May 21, 2013.  

OnePower
is a start up company, with its operations located in Lebanon, engaged in the development of an electronic bill delivery and payment
system (the  OP SYSTEM ) that is intended to provide Middle Eastern utility companies with the ability to present
bills and receive payment electronically. OnePower is a  shell  company as defined by the SEC as a result of only
having nominal operations and nominal assets. OnePower is an  emerging growth company  under the federal securities
laws and will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. OnePower s mission is to become the leading provider
of electronic bill delivery and payment services for all business-to-consumer transactions within the utility industry.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS  

Our
financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be
unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We
expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.  

Nine-month
Period Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to the Nine-month Period Ended August 31, 2015.   

Our
net loss for the nine-month period ended August 31, 2016 was $14,074 (2015: $15,754), which consisted of general and administration
expenses. We did not generate any revenue during either nine-month period in fiscal 2016 or 2015. The expenses in the both fiscal
years relate to accounting, audit, and legal fees that we have incurred in connection with the required filings with the Securities
  Exchange Commission.  

The
weighted average number of shares outstanding was 17,454,545 for the nine-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.  

Three-month
Period Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to the Three-month Period Ended August 31, 2015.   

Our
net loss for the three-month period ended August 31, 2016 was $3,559 (2015: $7,960), which consisted of general and administration
expenses. We did not generate any revenue during either three-month period in fiscal 2016 or 2015. The expenses in the both fiscal
years relate to accounting, audit, and legal fees that we have incurred in connection with the required filings with the Securities
  Exchange Commission.  

The
weighted average number of shares outstanding was 17,454,545 for the three-month periods ended August 31, 2016 and 2015.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

As
at August 31, 2016, our current assets were $10,185 compared to $5,134 in current assets at November 30, 2015. As at August 31,
2016, our current liabilities were $79,662 compared to $60,538 at November 30, 2015. Current liabilities at August 31, 2016 were
comprised of $65,000 in loans payable $20,000 of which was to a related parties ($10,000 to our director) and $14,662 in accounts
payable and accrued liabilities.  

Stockholders 
deficit increased from $55,404 as of November 30, 2015 to $69,477 as of August 31, 2016.  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities   

We
have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the nine-month period ended August 31, 2016, net cash flows
used in operating activities were $4,949consisting of net loss of $14,074 offset by $9,125 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
For the nine-month period ended August 31, 2015, net cash flows used in operating activities were $14,577 consisting of a net
loss of $15,754 offset by $1,177 increase in accounts payable.  

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities   

We
have financed our operations primarily from either the issuance of our shares of common stock, loans from our director and outside
loans. For the nine-month period ended August 31, 2016, we realized $10,000 cash from a convertible note payable from a third
party. For the nine-month period ended August 31, 2015 we realized $10,000 in net cash from a convertible note payable from a
third party.  

PLAN
OF OPERATION AND FUNDING  

We
expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances
of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.  

Existing
working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations
over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations
to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management
anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii)
developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses
with further issuances of securities and director loans. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate
revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in
dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common
stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are
not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities,
which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. We will have to raise additional funds in the next
twelve months in order to sustain and expand our operations. We currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such
funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock.
We have and will continue to seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors, although no future arrangement for additional
loans has been made. We do not have any agreements with our directors concerning these loans. We do not have any arrangements
in place for any future equity financing.  

OFF-BALANCE
SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

As
of the date of this report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity,
capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.  

GOING
CONCERN  

The
independent auditors  report accompanying our November 30, 2014 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph
expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared  assuming
that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities
and commitments in the ordinary course of business.  

ITEM
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.    

No
report required.  

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including its principal executive officer
or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure.  

An
evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of August 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in SEC rules and forms. Such officer also confirmed that there was no change in our internal control over financial
reporting during the nine-month period ended August 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

2.

others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;

evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
