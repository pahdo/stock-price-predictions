Note
1     Nature of Business   

(a)   
       Reporting
    Entity    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include
all the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Operating results for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December
31, 2016. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting
of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended
December 31, 2015 included in Form 10-K of Akers Biosciences, Inc. and Subsidiaries ( the Company ).  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include two dormant subsidiaries, Akers Acquisition Sub, Inc. and Bout Time Marketing
Corporation. All material intercompany balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

(b)   
       Nature
    of Business    

The
Company commenced research and development operations in September 1989, and until 2005 had devoted substantially all its efforts
to establishing the new business.  

The
Company s primary focus is the development and sale of disposable diagnostic testing devices that can be performed in minutes,
to facilitate time sensitive therapeutic decisions. The Company s main products are a disposable breathalyzer test that
measures the blood alcohol content of the user, a rapid test detecting the antibody causing an allergic reaction to Heparin and
a disposable breathalyzer test that measures Free Radical activity in the human body.  

Note
2 -   Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies   

(a)   
       Basis
    of Presentation    

The
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in U.S. Dollars and in accordance with GAAP.  

The
Company is an emerging growth company as the term is used in The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act enacted on April 5, 2012
and has elected to comply with certain reduced public company reporting requirements.

(b)   
       Use
    of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that
affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results
may differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting
estimates are recognized in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. In particular, information
about significant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant
effect on the amounts recognized in the financial statements is included in the following notes for revenue recognition, allowances
for doubtful accounts, inventory write-downs, impairment of intangible assets and valuation of share based payments.  

(c)   
       Functional
    and Presentation Currency    

These
condensed consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. Dollars, which is the Company s functional currency. All
financial information presented in U.S. Dollars has been rounded to the nearest dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains or
losses, resulting from loans and cash balances denominated in foreign currencies, are recorded in the condensed consolidated statement
of operations.  

(d)   
       Comprehensive
    Income/(Loss)    

The
Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 220 in reporting comprehensive
income (loss). Comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology that includes disclosure of certain financial
information that historically has not been recognized in the calculation of net income.  

(e)   
       Cash
    and Cash Equivalents    

Cash
and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. The Company considers all highly liquid investments, which include short-term bank
deposits (up to 3 months from date of deposit) that are not restricted as to withdrawal date or use, to be cash equivalents. Bank
overdrafts are shown as part of trade and other payables in the condensed consolidated balance sheet.

(f)   
       Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, receivables and trade and other
payables. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and trade and other payables approximate their fair value
because of their short maturities. The fair value of marketable securities is described in Note 2(g).  

(g)   
       Fair
    Value Measurement   Marketable Securities    

The
framework for measuring fair value provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
under FASB ASC 820 are described as follows:  

Level
    1  
      Inputs
    to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company
    has the ability to access.   

Level
    2  
      Inputs
    to the valuation methodology include   

quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;   

quoted
    prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;   

inputs
    other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;   

inputs
    that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   

If
the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term
of the asset or liability.  

Level
    3  
      Inputs
    to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.   

The
asset or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs.

(h)   
       Trade
    Receivables, Trade Receivables   Related Party and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts    

The
carrying amounts of current trade receivables is stated at cost, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and approximate their
fair value given their short term nature.  

The
normal credit terms extended to customers ranges between 30 and 90 days. The Company reviews all receivables that exceed terms
and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s assessment of the collectability of trade and other
receivables. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the amount of allowance. The Company considers the historical
level of credit losses, makes judgments about the credit worthiness of each customer based on ongoing credit evaluations and monitors
current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, allowances for doubtful accounts were $1,010,196 and $864,000. Allowances charged
for doubtful accounts amounted to $- for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  

(i)   
       Concentration
    of Credit Risk    

The
Company is exposed to credit risk in the normal course of business primarily related to trade receivables and cash and cash equivalents.  

Substantially
all of the Company s cash is maintained with Fulton Bank of New Jersey and Bank of America. The funds are insured by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to a maximum of $250,000 per account or instrument, but are otherwise unprotected. The
Company placed $181,216 and $369,525 with Fulton Bank of New Jersey, $10,604 and $28,494 with Bank of America and $4,040 with
PayPal as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Concentration
of credit risk with respect to trade receivables exists as approximately 80% of its revenue was generated by three customers for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These customers accounted for 38% of gross trade receivables (including related parties)
as of September 30, 2016. In order to limit such risks, the Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
financial condition.  

(j)   
       Inventories    

Inventories
are measured at the lower of cost or market. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted-average principle, and includes
expenditures incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs incurred in bringing them to
their existing location and condition. In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, costs include an appropriate
share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.  

(k)   
       Property,
    Plant and Equipment    

Items
of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Costs include
expenditures that are directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.

Gains
and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with
the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized within  other income  in the condensed consolidated
statement of operations.  

Depreciation
is recognized in the condensed consolidated statement of operations on the accelerated basis over the estimated useful lives of
the property, plant and equipment.  

The
estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:  

Useful
    Life    

(in
    years)    
 
      Plant
    and equipment  
      5-12   
 
      Furniture
    and fixtures  
      5-10   
 
      Computer
    equipment   software  
      3-5

Leasehold
    Improvements  
      Shorter
    of the remaining lease or estimated useful life   

Depreciation
methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date.  

(l)   
       Intangible
    Assets    

(i)   
       Patents
    and Trade Secrets    

The
Company has developed or acquired several diagnostic tests that can detect the presence of various substances in a person s
breath, blood, urine and saliva. Propriety protection for the Company s products, technology and process is important to
its competitive position. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has ten patents from the United States Patent Office in
effect (9,383,368; 7,896,167; 8,097,171; 8,003,061; 8,425,859; 8,871,521; 8,808,639; D691,056; D691,057 and D691,058).
Other patents are in effect in Australia through the Design Registry (348,310; 348,311 and 348,312), the Community Trade Mark
in the European Union ((OHIM) 002216895-0001; 002216895-0002 and 002216895-0003), in Hong Kong (HK11004006) and in Japan
(1,515,170; 4,885,134; 4,931,821 and 5,775,790). Patents are in the national phase of prosecution in many Patent Cooperation Treaty
participating countries. Additional proprietary technology consists of numerous different inventions. The Company intends to file
additional patent applications, where appropriate, relating to new products, technologies and their use in the U.S., European
and Asian markets. Management intends to protect all other intellectual property (e.g. copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets)
using all legal remedies available to the Company.

(ii)   
       Patent
    Costs    

Costs
associated with applying for patents are capitalized as patent costs. Once the patents are approved, the respective costs are
amortized over their estimated useful lives (maximum of 17 years) on a straight-line basis. Patent pending costs for patents that
are not approved are charged to the statement of operations the year the patent is rejected.  

In
addition, patents may be purchased from third parties. The costs of acquiring the patent are capitalized as patent costs if it
represents a future economic benefit to the Company. Once a patent is acquired it is amortized over its remaining useful life.  

(iii)   
       Other
    Intangible Assets    

Other
intangible assets that are acquired by the Company, which have definite useful lives, are measured at cost less accumulated amortization
and accumulated impairment losses.  

(iv)   
       Amortization    

Amortization
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date
that they are available for use. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:  

Useful
    Life    

(in
    years)    
 
      Patents
    and trademarks  
      12-17   
 
      Customer
    lists  
      5

(m)   
       Recoverability
    of Long-lived Assets    

In
accordance with FASB ASC 360-10-35  Impairment or Disposal of Long-lived Assets , long-lived assets to be held and
used are analyzed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may
not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate. The Company evaluates at each balance
sheet date whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate possible impairment.  

The
Company determines the existence of such impairment by measuring the expected future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest
charges) and comparing such amount to the carrying amount of the assets. An impairment loss, if one exists, is then measured as
the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the discounted estimated future cash flows. Assets to be disposed
of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value of such assets less costs to sell. Asset impairment charges
are recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the long-lived asset that will be sold or disposed of to their estimated fair values.
Charges for the asset impairment reduce the carrying amount of the long-lived assets to their estimated salvage value in connection
with the decision to dispose of such assets.

(n)   
       Investments    

In
accordance with FASB ASC 323, the Company recognizes investments in joint ventures based upon the Company s ability to significantly
influence the operational or financial policies of the joint venture. An objective judgment of the level of influence is made
at the time of the investment based upon several factors including, but not limited to the following:  

a)  
      Representation
    on the Board of Directors   

b)  
      Participation
    in policy-making processes   

c)  
      Material
    intra-entity transactions   

d)  
      Interchange
    of management personnel   

e)  
      Technological
    dependencies   

f)  
      Extent
    of ownership and the ability to influence decision making based upon the makeup of other owners when the shareholder group
    is small.   

The
Company follows the equity method for valuating investments in joint ventures when the existence of significant influence over
operational and financial policy has been established, as determined by management; otherwise, the Company will valuate these
investments using the cost method.  

Investments
recorded using the cost method will be assessed for any decrease in value that has occurred that is other than temporary and the
other than temporary decrease in value shall be recognized. As and when circumstances and facts change, the Company will evaluate
the Company s ability to significantly influence operational and financial policy to establish a basis for converting the
investment accounted for using the cost method to the equity method of valuation.  

On
March 9, 2015, the Company contributed capital of $64,675 in Hainan Savy Akers Biosciences, Ltd., a company incorporated in the
People s Republic of China, resulting in a 19.9% ownership interest. The contribution was adjusted downward to $64,091 on
April 8, 2015; the net effect of the currency conversion when the contribution was processed in Hainan. This is included in other
assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and is accounted for using the cost method.  

(o)   
       Revenue
    Recognition    

In
accordance with FASB ASC 605, the Company recognizes revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of a customer or distributor arrangement
exists, (ii) a retailer, distributor or wholesaler receives the goods and acceptance occurs, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable,
and (iv) the collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. Subject to these criteria, the Company recognizes revenue from
product sales when title passes to the customer based on shipping terms. The Company typically does not accept returns nor offer
charge backs or rebates except for certain distributors. Revenue recorded is net of any discount, rebate or sales return. No accrual
for estimated sales returns are necessary as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

The
Company instituted a significant price increase for certain PIFA products effective May 1, 2015. In an effort to phase in the
increase for existing customers, the Company is providing a rebate to its distributors for the price increase through April 30,
2016 for their existing customer base as of April 30, 2015. The Company has recorded rebates of $84,128 and $299,781, which is
a reduction of revenue, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $70,282 and $362,150 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2015 for this program. Accounts receivable will be reduced when the rebates are applied by the customer.  

Effective
May 1, 2016, the Company completed the implementation of pricing based upon a standardized adjusted dealer cost model. The program
allows for pre-existing end-user customers to negotiate pricing contracts directly with the Company or through the distributor
network. Rebates are available to the distributors to mitigate the effect of any discounts on these contracts. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accrued rebates amounted to $255,954 and $223,542.  

License
fee revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license agreement.  

When
the Company enters into arrangements that contain more than one deliverable, the Company allocates revenue to the separate elements
under the arrangement based on their relative selling prices in accordance with FASB ASC 605-25.  

(p)   
       Income
    Taxes    

The
Company follows FASB ASC 740 when accounting for income taxes, which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting
and reporting for income taxes. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for temporary differences between
the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future
based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income
tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred
tax assets and liabilities.  

(q)   
       Shipping
    and Handling Fees and Costs    

The
Company charges actual shipping plus a handling fee to customers, which amounted to $12,321 and $42,754 for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and $10,998 and $43,776 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. These fees are
classified as part of product revenue in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Shipping and other related delivery
costs, including those for incoming raw materials are classified as part of the cost of net revenue, which amounted to $19,418
and $88,427 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $15,590 and $82,996 for the three and nine months ended

       Research
    and Development Costs    

In
accordance with FASB ASC 730, research and development costs are expensed when incurred.  

(s)   
       Stock-based
    Payments    

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation under the provisions of FASB ASC 718,  Compensation Stock Compensation ,
which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors
based on estimated fair values on the grant date. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes model. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense
over the shorter of the period over which services are to be received or the vesting period.  

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards to non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC 505-50,  Equity-Based
Payments to Non-Employees . Under FASB ASC 505-50, the Company determines the fair value of the stock-based compensation
awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever
is more reliably measurable.  

The
Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes model. The value of the portion
of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the period which services are to be received. At
the end of each financial reporting period, prior to vesting or prior to the completion of services, the fair value of equity
based payments will be re-measured and the non-cash expense recognized during the period will be adjusted accordingly. Since the
fair value of equity based payments granted to non-employees is subject to change in the future, the amount of the future expense
will include fair value re-measurements until the equity based payments are fully vested or the service is completed.  

(t)   
       Basic
    and Diluted Earnings per Share of Common Stock    

Basic
earnings per common share are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted
earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares plus dilutive common share equivalents outstanding
during the period.  

Potential
common shares consist of restricted shares of common stock, options and warrants. Diluted net income per common share for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 included 56,000 units of options and 18,333 units of unvested restricted shares of
common stock. Diluted net loss per common share was the same as basic loss per common share for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 since the effect of options and warrants would be anti-dilutive
due to the net loss attributable to the common stockholders for the periods. Instruments excluded from dilutive earnings per share,
because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were 203,000 units of options and 18,333 units of unvested restricted shares
of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 175,000 units of options for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015.

The
aggregate intrinsic value is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the closing

stock have the same voting rights as common stock, are entitled to receive dividends and other distributions thereon and are considered
to be currently issued and outstanding. The Company s restricted stock awards vest of a period of one to three years. The
Company expenses the cost of the restricted stock awards, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the

the restricted stock is determined based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the grant date.

On October 17, 2016 the Company
was served with a notice that Pulse Health LLC ( Pulse ) filed a lawsuit against the Company on September 30, 2016
in United States Federal District Court, District of Oregon, alleging a breach of contract under the Settlement Agreement entered
into by the Company and Pulse on April 8, 2011 which settled all claims and disputes between the Company and Pulse arising from
a previously executed Technology Development Agreement entered into by the Company and Pulse and damages resulting from said alleged
breach. Additionally, Pulse alleges false advertising and unlawful trade practices in connection with the Company s sales
activities of the Company s OxiChek products. The Company disputes such allegations. The lawsuit is in an early stage and
the Company intends to establish a rigorous defense of all claims. As a reasonable estimate of any loss from this case cannot

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other
reports filed by Akers Biosciences, Inc. ( Akers ,  Akers Bio ,  we  or the  Company )
from time to time with the SEC (collectively, the  Filings ) contain or may contain forward-looking statements and
information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company s management as well as
estimates and assumptions made by Company s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the Filings, the words  anticipate, 
 believe,   estimate,   expect,   future,   intend,   plan, 
or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company s management identify
forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject
to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including the risks relating to the Company s business, industry,
and the Company s operations and results of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize,
or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed,
estimated, expected, intended, or planned. 

Although
the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee
future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities
laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements
to actual results.  

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ).
These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments
and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments
and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented.
Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results.
In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management s
judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative
would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements
and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.  

Overview   

Akers
Bio develops, manufactures, and supplies rapid, point-of-care screening and testing products designed to bring health-related
information directly to the patient or clinician in a time- and cost-efficient manner. Akers believes it has advanced the science
of diagnostics through the development of several proprietary platform technologies that provide product development flexibility.  

All of Akers  rapid, single-use tests
are performed  in vitro  (outside the body) and are designed to enhance patient well-being and reduce the cost of healthcare.
The Company s current product offerings and pipeline products focus on delivering diagnostic assistance in a wide variety
of healthcare fields/specialties, including cardiology/emergency medicine, metabolism/nutrition, diabetes, oncology and
infectious disease detection, as well as for on- and off-the-job alcohol safety initiatives. 

Akers
believes that low-cost, single-use testing not only saves time and money, but allows for more frequent, near-patient testing which
may save lives. We believe that our FDA-cleared rapid diagnostic tests help facilitate targeted diagnoses and real-time treatment.
We also believe that our rapid diagnostic tests surpass most other current diagnostic products with their flexibility, speed,
ease-of-use, readability, low cost and accuracy. In minutes, detection of disease states and medical conditions can be performed
on single-patient specimens, without sacrificing accuracy.  

We
believe the use of rapid tests, which can be performed at the point-of-care when and where the patient is being consulted, can
result in immediate diagnostic decisions and subsequent treatment regimens and is an important development in the practice of
medicine. Point-of-care testing addresses today s challenges in the healthcare industry, such as:  

cost
    pressures/efficiency of healthcare delivery;   

need
    for affordable mass screening tests for key infectious diseases, cardiac conditions, and metabolic markers;   

need
    for easy to use, accurate at-home tests for individuals to monitor their personal health and wellness; and   

public
    health needs in developing countries lacking basic health infrastructure.   

Recently,
the Company has developed tests for non-medical use within the health and wellness industry. These tests will monitor general
markers of health and wellness as they relate to diet, nutrition and exercise programs . 

Management s
Plans and Basis of Presentation   

To
date, the Company has in large part relied on equity financing to fund its operations, raising $13,101,336, net of expenses, in
an initial public offering on the NASDAQ Capital Market in 2014. The Company has experienced recurring losses and negative cash
flows from operations. Management s strategic plans include the following:  

continuing
    to advance the development and commercialization of the Company s products, especially those that utilize MPC Biosensor,
    PIFA and seraSTAT technologies;   

continuing
    to strengthen and forge domestic and international relationships with well-established sales organizations with strong distribution
    channels in specific target markets for both our currently marketed and emerging products;   

establishing
    clinical protocols that support regulatory submissions and publication of data within peer-reviewed journals; and   

continuing
    to monitor and implement cost control initiatives to conserve cash.   

Despite
our plans, the Company expects to continue to incur losses from operations for the near-term for the following reasons:  

some
    of Akers  distribution partnerships have been recently established or are in the process of being initiated and, therefore,
    consistent and historical ordering patterns have not been instituted;   

the
    Company continues to incur expenses related to the initial commercialization and marketing activities for its wellness products
    and product development (research, clinical trials, regulatory tasks) costs for its emerging products including Breath PulmoHealth,
    BreathScan  DKA and PIFA PLUSS  Infectious Disease point-of-care tests; and   

to
    expand the use of its clinical laboratory products, the Company may need to invest in additional marketing support programs
    to increase brand awareness.   

At
September 30, 2016, Akers had cash of $195,860, working capital of $2,537,197, stockholders  equity of $4,470,500 and an
accumulated deficit of $96,383,706. The Company believes that its current working capital position will be sufficient to meet
its estimated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. The Company closely monitors its cash balances, cash needs and
expense levels.  

Summary
of Statements of Operations for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenue   

Akers 
revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $613,198, a 262% increase from the same period in 2015. The
table below summarizes our revenue by product line for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as the percentage
of change year-over-year:  

Revenue
from the Company s PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay products increased 341% during the three months ended September 30, 2016
over the same period of 2015. The increase is due primarily to two events; first, the implementation of a significant price increase
for the product line and second, during 2015, the Company experienced lower than usual distributor stock depletion for the PIFA
Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay products which did not re-occur during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

The Company received a $2.5 million order
for PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay products from Novotek on February 29, 2016. The Company received an initial payment of $250,000
on April 29, 2016 and a second payment of $250,000 on June 28, 2016 for scheduled product shipments, per the terms of sale. The
Company recognized no revenue for PIFA Heparin/PF4 products from Novotek during the three months ended September 30, 2016; however,
the remaining products will be scheduled to ship at various points throughout the remainder of the current fiscal year
with the remaining $2,000,000 of revenue under the order being recognized when the criteria for the recognition
of revenue is met. 

The Company s MPC breathalyzer technology
product sales increased 256% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period of 2015. A distributor s
initial stocking order of $41,800 for the Company s BreathScan Lync and BreathScan OxiChek  products and renewed interest
in the Company s BreathScan Alcohol Breathalyzers, both domestically and internationally contributed to the increase during
the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Other
operating revenue decreased due to a decline in miscellaneous component sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
Company s gross margin improved significantly, rising to 61% (2015: (5)%) for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
The improvement is attributed to higher selling prices for the PIFA Heparin PF/4 Rapid Assay products, improved volumes and a
significantly different component mix for the MPC products and the continued implementation of the new inventory and cost management
procedures.  

Cost
of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $236,700 (2015: $177,952). Direct cost of sales decreased to 18%
of product revenue while other cost of sales decreased to 21% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 42%
and 63% respectively for the same period in 2015.  

Direct
cost of sales for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $109,835 (2015: $71,722). Other cost of sales for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 were $126,865 (2015: $106,230).  

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, totaled $558,293, which was a 27% decrease as compared
to $760,336 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
table below summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well
as the percentage of change year-over-year:  

The
decrease in personnel costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is the result of the transfer of Dr. Akers to the Research
and Development Department effective April 25, 2016.  

Professional
service costs decreased 55% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. Significant
decreases in legal fees ($56,919 (2015: $146,640)) and in personnel recruiting and general consulting fees ($2,125 (2015: $61,292))
were the major contributors.  

A
significant decline in general consulting, investor relations and transfer agent fees ($77,122 (2015: $136,531)) during the three
months ended September 30, 2016 resulted in an overall reduction in stock market and investor relations costs.  

A
significant decrease in travel expenses ($18,074 (2015: $65,171)) was offset by increases in depreciation (a one-time non-cash
adjustment) and insurance costs ($98,624 (2015: $38,989)) accounting for an increase of 8% in other general and administrative
costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

Sales
and Marketing Expenses   

Sales
and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $526,197, which was a 28% decrease as compared to
$725,832 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
table below summarizes our sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as the
percentage of change year-over-year:  

Personnel
costs decreased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The Company has reduced the
number of sales and marketing staff from 11 as of September 30, 2015 to 5 as of September 30, 2016. This reduction in the department s
headcount is a result of the transition of the sales and marketing strategy for the PIFA Heparin PF/4 products to focus less on
individual hospitals and more on integrated delivery networks which require fewer but more senior level staff. Costs declined
in all major categories including base wages, employee benefits, bonuses and commissions and employer taxes.  

The decrease in the use of contracted marketing
services firms ($- (2015: $55,500)) and general sales consultants ($77,094 (2015: $115,435)) resulted in a 55% decrease in professional
service costs. The Company has refocused its sales and marketing strategy, concentrating on the development of relationships with
Independent Manufacturing Representatives that are paid for performance versus the use of contracted sales groups paid
fixed monthly fees. 

A decrease in outside sales commissions ($10,879
(2015: $36,134)) was offset by a significant increase in royalty expenses ($117,949 (2015: $77,174)) for the three months
ended September 30, 2016. 

Other
sales and marketing costs increased primarily due to technology and sponsorship expenses ($35,544 (2015: $1,788)) and was offset
by decrease in advertising expenses ($2,255 ((2015: $12,905)).  

Research
and Development   

Research
and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $247,578, which was a 23% decrease as compared
to $319,646 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
table below summarizes our research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as
the percentage of change year-over-year:  

Personnel
costs increased 3% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015 as a result of the
transfer of Dr. Akers from the General and Administrative Department effective April 25, 2016 which was offset by an allocation
of expenses to direct cost of goods for the use of research and development personnel in manufacturing activities.  

The
Company had a clinical trial in-process during the three months ended September 30, 2016 resulting in a significant increase in
costs associated with these programs. The on-going trial is collecting data to support submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
for approvals and to support the clinical effectiveness of the product.  

Professional
service costs declined 63% during the three months ended September 30, 2016. During the three months ended September 30, 2015,
the Company was expending funds for the engineering and design of the BreathScan Lync  reader and cartridge being used with
the new MPC products. These design projects are now complete.  

A
reduction in the utilization of inventory resources for development and testing and a decrease in travel expenses ($4,042 (2015:
$18,720)) resulted in a decrease of 37% for other research and development costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
following table illustrates research and development costs by project for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively:  

Reversal of Reserve for Bad Debts  

The Company reversed a reserve for bad
debts for $1,299,609 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the legal settlement with ChubeWorkx Guernsey
Limited ( ChubeWorkx ) on August 17, 2016. Details of the settlement are included in Part II,
Section 1, Legal Proceedings. 

Other
Income and Expense   

Other
income, net of expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $8,893, which was a 52% decrease as compared to $18,519
for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
table below summarizes our other income and expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as the percentage
of change year-over-year:  

Gains
and losses associated with foreign currency transactions improved by 281% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the same period of 2015, primarily a result of improved exchange rates between the US Dollar and the British Pound.  

Other
income and expenses primarily consist of realized gains on investments totaling $1,269 (2015: loss of $5,213) and interest and
dividend earnings on the marketable securities and the note receivable totaling $3,995 (2015: $25,691).  

Income
Taxes    

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company does not believe any uncertain tax positions exist that would result in the Company having
a liability to the taxing authorities. The Company s policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits, if and when required, as part of interest expense and general and administrative expense, respectively in the consolidated
statement of operations.  

Summary
of Statements of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Revenue   

Akers 
revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $2.307,708, a 40% increase from the nine months ended September 30,
2015. Product revenue increased by 74%, primarily a result of sales of our PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay products. Total revenue
was impacted by the elimination of license fee revenue following the cancellation of the License and Supply Agreement with ChubeWorkx
Guernsey Limited ( ChubeWorkx ) in May, 2015 in respect to BreathScan Alcohol Breathalyzer products.  

The
table below summarizes our revenue by product line for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as the percentage
of change year-over-year:  

Revenue
from the Company s PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay products increased 100% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
over the same period of 2015. The increase is due primarily to two events; first, the implementation of a significant price increase
for the product line and second, the partial fulfillment of the $2.5 million order from Novotek, our exclusive distributor in
the Peoples Republic of China.  

The
Company received a $2.5 million order for our PIFA Heparin/PF4 Rapid Assay products from Novotek on February 29, 2016. The Company
received an initial payment of $250,000 on April 29, 2016 and a second payment of $250,000 on June 28, 2016 for scheduled product
shipments, per the terms of sale resulting in the recognition of $493,850 for PIFA Heparin/PF4 products and $12,551 of other
products from Novatek for the nine months ended September, 30, 2016. The remaining products will be scheduled to ship at various
points throughout the remainder of the current fiscal year with the remaining $2,000,000 of revenue under the
order being recognized when the criteria for the recognition of revenue is met.  

The Company s MPC product sales declined
17% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 over the same period of 2015. A distributor s initial stocking order
of approximately $144,000 for the Company s BreathScan Alcohol Breathalyzer products in Great Britain was included for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 but not repeated in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net of this significant
order, MPC product sales increased 117% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

While
most of the MPC product sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 came from BreathScan Alcohol Breathalyzers, we have
begun generating sales of other MPC products within our health and wellness line, primarily the Company s BreathScan OxiChek 
disposable breath test for oxidative stress which contributed $65,969.  

Other
operating revenue increased due to a rise in miscellaneous component sales and shipping and handling fees.  

The
Company s gross margin improved significantly, rising to 69% (2015: 54%) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The
improvement is attributed to improved margins for the PIFA Heparin PF/4 products resulting from the increase in average selling
price of these products.  

Cost
of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 4% to $713,576 (2015: $745,319). Direct cost of sales decreased
to 14% of product revenue while other cost of sales decreased to 17% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to 26% and 30% respectively for the same period in 2015.  

Direct
cost of sales for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 were $325,922 (2015: $353,659). The decrease is attributed to
the offset of manufacturing costs to inventory.  

Other cost of sales for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were $387,654 (2015: $391,660). The decrease is attributed to reductions in expenses related to quality
control testing and inventory shrinkage and is offset by increases in manufacturing consumable supplies and repairs and maintenance
expenses. 

General
and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, totaled $2,298,099, which was a 2% decrease as compared to $2,341,500 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The
table below summarizes our general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as
the percentage of change year-over-year:  

The
increase in personnel costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is the result of increases in costs associated with employee
benefits and the addition of a staff accountant in June 2015 and the Company s new Chief Executive Officer in November 2015.
These increases were offset by the transfer of Dr. Akers to the Research and Development Department effective April 25, 2016.  

Professional service costs decreased 21% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. Decreases in personnel recruiting, general consulting
fees and legal fees ($448,988 (2015: $636,014)) was offset by increases in accounting fees ($80,896 (2015: $45,160)). 

A decline in investor relations and transfer
agent fees ($201,806 (2015: $315,434)) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was partially offset by increases in general
consulting ($121,150 (2015: $103,436)) resulting in an overall reduction in stock market and investor relations costs. 

An increase in bad debts expense ($146,196
(2015: $-)) and depreciation expense ($65,326 (2015: $9,114)) was offset by a decline in travel expenses ($114,293
(2015: $208,567)) which contributed to the 19% increase in other general and administrative costs for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. 

Sales
and Marketing Expenses   

Sales and marketing expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $1,764,952, which was a 5% decrease as compared to $1,854,623 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

The
table below summarizes our sales and marketing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as the percentage
of change year-over-year:  

Personnel
costs decreased by 5% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015. The Company has
reduced the number of sales and marketing staff from 11 on September 30, 2015 to 5 as of September 30, 2016. The reduction in
the department s headcount is a result of the transition in the sales and marketing strategy for the PIFA Heparin PF/4 products
to focus less on individual hospitals and more on integrated delivery networks which require fewer but more senior level staff.
The Company replaced the sales and marketing senior management team during the first half of 2016 resulting in increased costs
associated with severance programs.  

The
decrease in the use of contracted marketing services firms ($51,246 (2015: $176,047)) and general sales consultants ($332,868
(2015: $361,669)) resulted in a 29% decrease in professional service costs. The Company has refocused its sales and marketing
strategy, concentrating on the development of relationships with Independent Manufacturing Representatives that are paid
for performance versus the use of contracted sales groups paid fixed monthly fees.  

Royalty
and commission costs increased as a result of outside sales commissions ($60,925 (2015: $52,966)), due to increased sales of the
PIFA products, both domestically and internationally, and royalty expenses ($117,949 (2015: $87,796)) in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.  

Other
sales and marketing costs increased primarily due to technology ($38,449 (2015: $12,839)), sponsorships ($10,500 (2015: $-)) and
travel ($144,622 (2015: $93,077)) expenses and was partially offset by decreases in advertising and promotional materials expenses
($4,663 (2015: $33,164)).  

Research
and Development   

Research
and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $932,858, which was a 9% decrease as compared to
$1,003,444 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
table below summarizes our research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as
the percentage of change year-over-year:  

Personnel
costs increased 11% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period of 2015 as a result of the
transfer of Dr. Akers from the General and Administrative Department effective April 25, 2016 and the employment of a new Director
of Quality Assurance.  

The
Company had two clinical trials in-process during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting in a significant increase
in costs associated with these programs. The trials are collecting data to support submissions to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
for approvals and to support the clinical effectiveness of the products.  

Professional
service costs declined 73% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the
Company was expending funds for the engineering and design of the BreathScan Lync  reader and cartridge being used with
the new MPC products. These design projects are now complete.  

Increase in supplies ($47,979 (2015: $36.221)),
seminars and professional development ($26,849 (2015: $780)) and waste disposal expenses ($15,252 (2015: $11,311)) was
offset by a reduction in the utilization of inventory resources for development and testing ($6,976 (2015: $34,551)) that resulted
in an increase of 8% for other research and development costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The
following table illustrates research and development costs by project for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:  

Reversal of Reserve for Bad Debts  

The Company reversed a reserve for bad
debts for $1,299,609 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the legal settlement with ChubeWorkx Guernsey
Limited ( ChubeWorkx ) on August 17, 2016. Details of the settlement are included in Part II,
Section 1, Legal Proceedings. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2015, the Company established a reserve for bad debts for $864,000 for 36 Strategies General Trading, a related party. 

Impairment
of Non-Current Assets   

The
Company performed a routine analysis of its intangible assets and determined that two patents and a trademark acquired in the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 are no longer contributing to the Company s revenue flows and were therefore impaired
for $466,476 (2014: $-) during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Other
Income and Expense   

Other income, net of expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $22,792, which was a 74% decrease as compared to $87,729 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. 

The
table below summarizes our other income and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as the percentage
of change year-over-year:  

Losses
associated with foreign currency transactions improved by 85% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
same period of 2015, primarily a result of improved exchange rates between the US Dollar and the British Pound.  

Other
income and expenses primarily consist of realized gains on investments totaling $3,421 (2015: loss of $7,201) and interest and
dividend earnings on the marketable securities and the note receivable totaling $20,560 (2015: $96,848).  

Income
Taxes      

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company does not believe any uncertain tax positions exist that would result in the Company having
a liability to the taxing authorities. The Company s policy is to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized
tax benefits, if and when required, as part of interest expense and general and administrative expense, respectively in the consolidated
statement of operations.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company generated a net loss attributable to shareholders of $2,207,707
and $5,734,921, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has an accumulated deficit of $96,383,706
and $94,175,999 and had cash totaling $195,860 and $402,059, respectively.  

Currently, our primary focus is to expand the
domestic and international distribution of our PIFA Heparin/PF4 rapid assays. The Company s secondary focus is fully commercializing
the health and wellness product line linked to smartphones and tablets. The Company continues commercialization tasks for its PIFA
PLUSS  Infectious Disease single-use assays, BreathScan  DKA, and Breath PulmoHealth products, including advancement of
the steps required for FDA clearance or CE marking in the EU where necessary. 

We expect to continue to incur losses from
operations for the near-term as we incur product development, clinical and regulatory activities, contract consulting and other
product development and commercialization related expenses. We believe that our current working capital position will be sufficient
to meet our estimated cash needs for at least twelve months. We are closely monitoring our cash balances, cash needs and expense
levels. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability
and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result in the possible inability of the
Company to continue as a going concern. 

We expect that our primary expenditures will be to continue development of additional health and wellness
products, PIFA PLUSS  Infectious Disease single-use assays, BreathScan  DKA and Breath PulmoHealth products, enrolling
patients in clinical trials to support performance claims, generating studies in peer-reviewed journals to support product marketing,
and provide data for the FDA 510(k) clearance/CE certifications processes when required. We will also continue to support commercialization
and marketing activities of commercialized products (PIFA Heparin/PF4 rapid assays, PIFA PLUSS  PF4 and breath alcohol
detectors in the US and internationally. Based upon our experience, clinical trial and related regulatory expenses can be significant
costs. Steps to achieve commercialization of emerging products will be an ongoing and evolving process with expected improvements
and possible subsequent generations being evaluated for commercialized and emerging tests. Should we be unable to achieve FDA
clearance for products that require such regulatory  approval , develop performance characteristics for rapid tests
that satisfy market needs, or generate sufficient revenue from commercialized products, we would need to rely on other business
or product opportunities to generate revenue and costs that we have incurred for the patents may be deemed impaired. 

Capital
expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $88,023 (2015: $60,254). Capital expenditures, primarily for production
and laboratory costs for the year ending December 31, 2016 are expected to be approximately $125,000. As per the Company s
lease agreement, the owner of the facility will be handling the majority of facility upgrades, and we anticipate financing any
production and laboratory capital expenditures through working capital.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company invested $64,091 for a 19.9% ownership position in a joint venture with
Hainan Savy Investment Management, Ltd and Mr. Thomas Knox, the Company s Chairman, to research, develop, produce and sell
Akers  rapid diagnostic screening and testing products in China. The new entity, incorporated in the People s Republic
of China, operates as Hainan Savy Akers Biosciences, Ltd.  

The
Company may enter into generally short-term consulting and development agreements primarily for testing services and in connection
with clinical trials conducted as part of the Company s development process which may include activities related to the
development of technical files for FDA 510(k) clearance submissions. Such commitments at any point in time may be significant
but the agreements typically contain cancellation provisions.  

We
lease our manufacturing facility which also contains our administrative offices. Our current lease was executed January 1, 2013
and is effective through December 31, 2019. The Company has leased this property from the current owner since 1997.  

Management
continues to place increased emphasis on monitoring the risks associated with the current environment, particularly the recoverability
of current assets, the fair value of assets, and the Company s liquidity. At this point in time, there has not been a material
impact on the Company s assets and liquidity. Management will continue to monitor the risks associated with the current
environment and their impact on the Company s results.  

The
table below summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as well as the percentage of change
year-over-year:

cash, primarily related to routine changes in operating activities. A net increase in other receivables, inventories, and other
assets of $170,717 and a decrease in deferred revenue   related party of $305,556 consumed cash from operating activities.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

We
intend to utilize the extended transition period provided in Securities Act Section 7(a)(2)(B) as allowed by Section 107(b)(1)
of the JOBS Act for the adoption of new or revised accounting standards as applicable to emerging growth companies. Under the
JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates
for public and private companies until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have elected to use the extended
transition period for complying with these new or revised accounting standards. Since we will not be required to comply with new
or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies,
our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that comply with public company effective
dates. If we were to elect to comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to
Section 107 of the JOBS Act.  

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(US GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial
statements and accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty. Therefore, the
determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates, and
such differences may be material to the financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation
of our financial statements include estimates associated with revenue recognition, impairment analysis of intangibles and stock-based
compensation.  

The
Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows are impacted by the accounting policies the Company has
adopted. In order to get a full understanding of the Company s financial statements, one must have a clear understanding
of the accounting policies employed. A summary of the Company s critical accounting policies follows:  

Trade
Receivables, Trade Receivables   Related Party and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts   

The
carrying amounts of current trade receivables is stated at cost, net of allowance for doubtful accounts and approximate their
fair value given their short term nature.  

The
normal credit terms extended to customers ranges between 30 and 90 days. The Company reviews all receivables that exceed terms
and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s assessment of the collectability of trade and other
receivables. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the amount of allowance. The Company considers the historical
level of credit losses, makes judgments about the credit worthiness of each customer based on ongoing credit evaluations and monitors
current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future.  

Fair
Value Measurement   Marketable Securities   

The
framework for measuring fair value provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to
measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities (level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (level 3). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy
under FASB ASC 820 are described as follows:  

Level
    1  
      Inputs
    to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the Company
    has the Ability to access.   

Level
    2  
      Inputs
    to the valuation methodology include   

quoted
    prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;   

quoted
    prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;   

inputs
    other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;   

inputs
    that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   

If
the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term
of the asset or liability.  

Level
    3  
      Inputs
    to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.   

The
asset or liability s fair value measurement level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input
that is significant to the fair value measurement. Valuation techniques maximize the use of relevant observable inputs and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs.  

Intangible
Assets   

The Company has developed or acquired several
diagnostic tests that can detect the presence of various substances in a person s breath, blood, urine and saliva. Propriety
protection for the Company s products, technology and process is important to its competitive position. As of September
30, 2016, the Company has ten patents from the United States Patent Office in effect (9,383,368; 7,896,167;
8,097,171; 8,003,061; 8,425,859; 8,871,521; 8,808,639; D691,056; D691,057 and D691,058). Other patents are in effect in Australia
through the Design Registry (348,310; 348,311 and 348,312), the Community Trade Mark in the European Union ((OHIM) 002216895-0001;
002216895-0002 and 002216895-0003), in Hong Kong (HK11004006) and in Japan (1,515,170; 4,885,134; 4,931,821 and 5,775,790).
Patents are in the national phase of prosecution in many Patent Cooperation Treaty participating countries. Additional proprietary
technology consists of numerous different inventions. The Company intends to file additional patent applications, where appropriate,
relating to new products, technologies and their use in the US, European and Asian markets. Management intends to protect all
other intellectual property (e.g. copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets) using all legal remedies available to the Company. 

Costs
associated with applying for patents are capitalized as patent costs. Once the patents are approved, the respective costs are
amortized over a period of twelve to seventeen years on a straight-line basis. Patent pending costs for patents that are not approved
are charged to operations the year the patent is rejected.  

In
addition, patents may be purchased from third parties. The costs of acquiring the patent are capitalized as patent costs if it
represents a future economic benefit to the Company. Once a patent is acquired it is amortized over its remaining life. The Company
amortizes these costs over the shorter of the legal life of the patent or its estimated economic life using the straight-line
method. The Company tests intangible assets with finite lives upon significant changes in the Company s business environment.  

Long-Lived
Assets   

Items
of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Cost includes
expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment
have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment. Gains
and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with
the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognized net within  other income  in profit or loss.  

Investments   

In
accordance with FASB ASC 323, the Company recognizes investments in joint ventures based upon the Company s ability to significantly
influence the operational or financial policies of the joint venture. An objective judgment of the level of influence is made
at the time of the investment based upon several factors including, but not limited to the following:  

a)  
      Representation
    on the Board of Directors   

b)  
      Participation
    in policy-making processes   

c)  
      Material
    intra-entity transactions   

d)  
      Interchange
    of management personnel   

e)  
      Technological
    dependencies   

f)  
      Extent
    of ownership and the ability to influence decision making based upon the makeup of other owners when the shareholder group
    is small.   

The
Company follows the equity method for valuating investments in joint ventures when the existence of significant influence over
operational and financial policy has been established, as determined by management; otherwise, the Company will valuate these
investments using the cost method.  

Investments
recorded using the cost method will be assessed for any decrease in value that has occurred that is other than temporary and the
other than temporary decrease in value shall be recognized. As and when circumstances and facts change, the Company will evaluate
the Company s ability to significantly influence operational and financial policy to establish a basis for converting the
investment accounted for using the cost method to the equity method of valuation.  

Revenue
Recognition   

In
accordance with FASB ASC 605, the Company recognizes revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of a customer or distributor arrangement
exists, (ii) a retailer, distributor or wholesaler receives the goods and acceptance occurs, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable,
and (iv) the collectability of the revenue is reasonably assured. Subject to these criteria, the Company recognizes revenue from
product sales when title passes to the customer based on shipping terms. The Company typically does not accept returns nor offer
charge backs or rebates except for certain distributors. Revenue recorded is net of any discount, rebate or sales return.  

License
fee revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the license agreement.  

When
the Company enters into arrangements that contain more than one deliverable, the Company allocates revenue to the separate elements
under the arrangement based on their relative selling prices in accordance with FASB ASC 605-25.  

Stock-based
Compensation   

FASB
ASC 718,  Share-Based Payment , defines the fair-value-based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation plans
and transactions used by the Company to account for its issuances of equity instruments to record compensation cost for stock-based
employee compensation plans at fair value as well as to acquire goods or services from non-employees. Transactions in which the
Company issues stock-based compensation to employees, directors and consultants and for goods or services received from non-employees
are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued. The Company utilizes pricing models in determining
the fair values of options and warrants issued as stock-based compensation. The Black-Scholes model is utilized to calculate the
fair value of equity instruments.  

Recently
Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   

The
Company has evaluated all recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements and believes such pronouncements do not have a
material effect on the Company s financial statements.  

Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk   

We
have limited exposure to market risks from instruments that may impact the  Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations,  and
 Statements of Cash Flows.  Such exposure is due primarily to changing interest rates.  

Interest
Rates   

The
primary objective for our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing
risk. This is accomplished by investing excess cash in highly liquid debt and equity investments of highly rated entities which
are classified as trading securities.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no significant known off balance sheet arrangements.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

We
do not hold any derivative instruments and do not engage in any hedging activities.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    

Pursuant
to Rule 13a- 15(b) under the Exchange Act, the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation of the Company s
management, including the Company s Principal Executive Officer ( PEO ) and Principal Financial Officer ( PFO ),
of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  

As
of September 30, 2016 and based upon that evaluation, the Company s PEO and PFO concluded that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures are effective   to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, including the Company s PEO and PFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.    

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange
Act, during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.    

From
time to time, we are a party to litigation and subject to claims incident to the ordinary course of business. Future litigation
may be necessary to defend ourselves and our customers by determining the scope, enforceability and validity of third party proprietary
rights or to establish our proprietary rights.  

On
August 17, 2016, the Company entered into a Settlement Agreement with ChubeWorkx Guernsey Limited ( ChubeWorkx ),
a major shareholder, which settled all pending claims between the Company and ChubeWorkx. Specifically, the Company and ChubeWorkx
agreed to voluntarily dismiss the action brought by the Company against ChubeWorkx for outstanding amounts due to Akers Bio under
a promissory note in a United States Federal Court suit, District of New Jersey and various claims brought by ChubeWorkx against
the Company arising from an exclusive licensing agreement between ChubeWorkx and the Company ( Licensing Agreement )
in a suit brought in The High Court of Justice, Queen s Bench Division Commercial Court, Royal Courts of Justice, United
Kingdom.  

Under
the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company will recover the full outstanding principal amount in the current fiscal year
in the form of $750,000 of BreathScan  Alcohol Detector inventory   which the Company intends to subsequently sell  
and the balance of $549,609 in cash. Akers Bio established an allowance for this doubtful note in the Company s financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a result of the Settlement Agreement, the Company reversed the allowance for
doubtful note in the amount of $1,299,609 which is included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive
Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

In
addition to addressing the promissory note described above, the Settlement Agreement also allows the Company to market and sell
all of the Company s breath technology tests worldwide, unencumbered by any past/future claims by ChubeWorkx under the Licensing
Agreement (entered into with ChubeWorkx in 2012 and subsequently amended in 2013). Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement,
ChubeWorkx no longer holds any rights pertaining to Akers Bio s BreathScan  technology, which serves as the basis for
a number of commercialized products including BreathScan  Alcohol Detector and BreathScan OxiChek  and a number of
products in development.  

In return for the Company regaining the full
rights to sell breath technology products, under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, ChubeWorkx is entitled to receive a royalty
of 5% of the Company s gross revenues (the  ChubeWorkx Royalty ) until ChubeWorkx has earned an aggregate $5,000,000,
after which point ChubeWorkx will no longer be entitled to receive any royalties from the Company and the Company shall
have no further obligation to ChubeWorkx. The Settlement Agreement further allows the Company to retain 50% of the ChubeWorkx
Royalty until the full $549,609 cash component of the monies owed by ChubeWorkx to Akers Bio as described above has been satisfied.
The Company recorded royalty expenses of $117,949 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 which are included in
sales and marketing expenses   related party on the condensed consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. 

Other terms of the Settlement include:
1) the pledge as security by the Company to ChubeWorkx all Company assets, worthy to satisfy its obligations, including all inventory
and receivables, with the exception of (i) distribution contracts of the Company or any of its affiliates, (ii) customer lists,
(iii) manufacturing processes (including all intellectual property required to use those processes and exploit products made thereby),
and (iv) all equipment required to perform said manufacturing processes and other equipment; and 2) the grant of voting proxy
by ChubeWorkx to the Company which allows the Company to vote ChubeWorkx s shares for corporate formalities under certain conditions. 

The pledged assets are only at risk in
the event that the Company cannot satisfy any outstanding royalty payment obligations subject to various cure periods and/or through
a restructuring and/or liquidation under the United States Bankruptcy laws of the Company in favor of payment of said obligation. 

On
October 17, 2016 the Company was served with a notice that Pulse Health LLC ( Pulse ) filed a lawsuit against the
Company on September 30, 2016 in United States Federal District Court, District of Oregon, alleging a breach of contract under
the Settlement Agreement entered into by the Company and Pulse on April 8, 2011 which settled all claims and disputes between
the Company and Pulse arising from a previously executed Technology Development Agreement entered into by the Company and Pulse
and damages resulting from said alleged breach. Additionally, Pulse alleges false advertising and unlawful trade practices in
connection with the Company s sales activities of the Company s OxiChek products. The Company disputes such allegations.
The lawsuit is in an early stage and the Company intends to establish a rigorous defense of all claims.  

With
the exception of the foregoing, we are not currently involved in any litigation that we believe could have a materially adverse
effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before
or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive
officers of our Company, threatened against or affecting our Company or our common stock, in which an adverse decision could have
a material adverse effect.
