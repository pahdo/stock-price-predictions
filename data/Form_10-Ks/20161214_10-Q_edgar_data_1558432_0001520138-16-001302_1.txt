STATEMENTS  

  NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

   Organization   

 Capstone Financial Group, Inc.
(the "Company") is a diversified company whose primary business focuses going forward include (a) investing in stock
of other companies, (b) identification and pursuit of and capitalization on opportunities in the minerals and agricultural commodities
industries and (c) commercial lending in foreign countries. 

 In the third quarter of 2016 the
Company entered into mirroring agreements for the purchase and for the resale of quantities of livestock over time, thereby
creating a  middleman  arbitrageur position as to this livestock. These agreements are characterized as best
efforts supply and sale agreements and will be accounted for as livestock is purchased and sold as it appears there is no
practical market mechanism to facilitate settlement of these transactions. At September 30, 2016, there was a $175,000 prepaid balance
related to a purchase order for livestock (see Note 7). 

In addition, in the third quarter of 2016 the
Company entered into an agreement to sell quantities of gold over time, with the intention of arranging a mirroring
supply of gold in order to thereby create a  middleman  position as to this gold. There were no gold transactions during
the third quarter of 2016. 

Until the second quarter of 2016, the
Company considered its primary business focus to be investing its own capital to acquire the outstanding equity securities of other
companies and to unlock and grow value in these privately-held or illiquid companies. 

 The Company sought, and seeks, to work
with the management and boards of the other companies. While the Company does not manage the day-to-day operations of these companies,
the Company sought, and seeks, to maintain a thorough understanding of operations and perform continual evaluations of performance
and prospects on an ongoing basis. 

 The Company may also seek to actively
trade in its strategic investment positions and/or enter into private securities transactions with regard to those positions, to
capitalize on price fluctuations and realize profits or minimize losses. 

 The Company was incorporated on July 10,
2012 under the laws of the State of Nevada, as Creative App Solutions, Inc.  On August 23, 2013, the Company
amended its articles of incorporation and changed its name to Capstone Financial Group, Inc.

   Market, Credit and Liquidity Risk   

 At September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015 the majority of Company s investments are focused in one entity, Twinlab Consolidated Holdings, Inc. ( Twinlab ).
Management believes that it will be able to liquidate a sufficient portion of its investment and/or raise additional capital to
fund its obligations as and when they become due. However, no assurance can be given that market conditions in the future will
continue to allow the Company to sell its investments in sufficient quantities to fund its obligations or to raise additional capital
to do so. 

 Market risk is the potential loss the
Company may incur as a result of changes in the market or fair value of a particular financial instrument. Risks arise in options
and warrant contracts from changes in the market or fair value of their underlying financial instruments. 

 Credit risk is the potential loss the
Company may incur as a result of the failure of a counterparty or an issuer to make payments according to the terms of a contract.
Credit risk can arise from investment activities in financially distressed issuers. To manage this risk, the Company may seek to
diversify its investment portfolio with respect to specific credits, sectors and asset classes. 

 The Company is also subject to market
concentration risk since a significant portion of its investment portfolio has similar characteristics, and is therefore affected
similarly by changes in economic conditions. 

  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

 Investments of the Company trade in
thin markets and throughout the year, depending upon market conditions, may be considered inactive. As a result, the market values
can be more volatile and difficult to determine relative to other securities. In addition, if the Company is required to liquidate
all or a portion of its portfolio quickly, it may realize significantly less than the value at which it previously recorded its
investments. 

   Basis of Presentation   

 The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared using the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the accounting and financial reporting conventions
of the investment company industry and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed
with the SEC on May 2, 2016. The unaudited condensed financial statements contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments
that in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2016,
the results of the Company s operations for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and the Company s
cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The results of operations for the three months and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any future interim periods.

  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

   Use of Estimates   

 The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires the Company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

   Cash Equivalents   

 The Company considers any investments
in short-term money market funds with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

   Investments    

 Investments primarily comprise strategic,
non-controlling equity ownership interests in privately held businesses or public companies with very illiquid trading markets.
These strategic investments are accounted for at fair value as determined by internal valuation guidelines and/or outside appraisals
as there are no readily ascertainable fair market value prices in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 946-10 and FASB ASC 820-10. Because the Company follows the financial accounting
and reporting conventions of the investment company industry, it reports investments at estimated fair value. 

 FASB ASC 820-10-65-4 provides additional
guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with FASB ASC 820-10 when the volume and level of market activity for the asset
or liability have significantly decreased. FASB ASC 820-10-65-4 also includes guidance on identifying circumstances that indicate
a transaction is not orderly. It acknowledges that in these circumstances quoted prices may not be determinative of fair value.
FASB ASC 820-10-65-4 emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of market activity for
the asset or liability and regardless of the valuation technique(s) used, the objective of a fair value measurement remains the
same. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
(that is, not a forced liquidation or distressed sale) between market participants at the measurement date under current market
conditions. Under FASB ASC 820-10-65-4, quoted prices for assets or liabilities in inactive markets may require adjustment due
to uncertainty as to whether the underlying transactions are orderly. There is little information, if any, to evaluate if individual
transactions are orderly in an inactive market. Accordingly, the Company is required to evaluate the facts and circumstances to
determine whether the transaction is orderly based on the weight of the evidence. FASB ASC 820-10-65-4 does not designate a specific
method for adjusting a transaction or quoted price; however, it does provide guidance for determining how much weight to give a
transaction or quoted price. Price quotes derived from transactions that are not orderly are not considered to be determinative
of fair value and should be given less weight, if any, when estimating fair value. In the absence of observable market data at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company's fair value measurements included assumptions about future cash flow and
appropriately risk-adjusted discount rates that it believes market participants would make in orderly market transactions.

   Fair Value Measurements and Valuation
Methodologies   

 GAAP defines fair value as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. GAAP establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation methodologies
into the following three levels:  

Level 1: Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and shall be used to measure fair value whenever available.   

Level 2: Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs to the valuation methodology that are derived principally from or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   

Level 3: Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.   
 
 The Company s financial instruments
are valued by level within the fair value hierarchy. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest
level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The valuation methodology for each investment type and discussion
of key unobservable inputs is described below. 

 The Company often invests in common
stocks that are thinly traded where the closing trading price is not considered to be a fair indication of the value for which
the Company can sell or buy the common stock. In such cases, as in the case of private-company limited liability company membership
interests held by the Company, the common stock must be analyzed to determine what exit price the Company would receive when liquidating
the position. These positions are classified as Level 3 securities. 

 The significant unobservable inputs
used in the fair value measurement of the Company s Level 3 common stocks are growth rate, risk premium, revenue multiples
and EBITDA multiples. Increases or decreases in any of those inputs in isolation would result in a lower or higher fair value measurement,
respectively.

  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

 The Company has warrants and call options
to purchase common stock in illiquid public companies. Generally, there is no established market for these investments. The Company
values these warrants and call options by using a model that takes into consideration the exercise or call price of the warrant
or call option, the price of the underlying common stock and the expiration date of the warrant or call option. 

 The significant unobservable inputs
used in the fair value measurement of the Company s warrants and call options includes the price of the underlying thinly
traded common stock (determined based upon growth rate, risk premium, revenue multiples and EBITDA multiples), duration and discount
rate and volatility. Increases or decreases in the premium-to-parity would result in a higher or lower fair value measurement,
respectively. 

 Generally, when the Company invests
in common stocks that are traded on the NASDAQ Markets or over-the-counter markets (such as the OTCBB, OTCQB or OTC Pink marketplaces),
such common stocks are valued at the last traded price. If there is no trade on a measurement date, the Company will typically
value the common stock at the closing bid price. However, in certain circumstances, the closing trading price is not considered
to be a fair indication of the value for which the Company can sell the common stock. In such cases, the common stock must be analyzed
to determine what exit price the Company would receive when liquidating the position. Investments in non-marketable common stocks
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were valued based, in part, on subsequent transactions with unrelated third parties
and at December 31, 2015 were valued by the Company with the assistance of an independent valuation consultant. These positions
are classified as Level 3 securities by the Company. 

 From time to time, the Company has investments
in private limited liability companies. Generally, there is no established market for these investments. The Company values these
interests by means of both quantitative and qualitative measures, generally including the financial stability of the company, the
economic rights of the interests and the economic prospects of the company. 

 The significant unobservable input used
in the fair value measurement of the Company s limited liability company investments is the expected recovery of contributed
capital. Increases or decreases in the expected recovery would result in a higher or lower fair value measurement, respectively. 

   Derivative Financial Instruments   

 Derivative financial instruments include
call options and warrants at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Derivatives are accounted for at fair value with changes
in fair value reported in operations. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s
derivative financial instruments include the underlying common stock, duration, volatility and discount rate, which are used in
the option pricing model. Changes to any of those inputs in isolation would result in fluctuations in the fair value measurement.

   Investment Transaction, Related
Income and Expenses   

 Purchases and sales of investments are
recorded on a trade-date basis. Realized gains and losses on investments are recognized on the first-in, first-out method. Dividend
income on investments owned is recognized on the ex-dividend date, net of applicable withholding taxes. 

   Treasury Stock Purchases   

 The Company is authorized to repurchase
shares of the Company s common stock in private transactions from time to time. The Company records treasury stock purchases
at cost. Any treasury stock removed from treasury is valued at cost using the specific identification method. 

   Revenue Recognition   

 The Company recognizes revenue for sales
of physical commodities or other goods when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence
of an arrangement; (2) the physical commodities or other goods have been delivered to the customer; (3) the purchase
price to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of the purchase price is reasonably assured. 

 The Company recognizes revenue for services
when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the related
service has been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and
(4) the collection of fees is reasonably assured. 

   Earnings per Share   

 Basic earnings per common share calculations
are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted
earnings per common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and
dilutive common share equivalents outstanding. During periods when common stock equivalents, if any, are anti-dilutive they are
not considered in the computation.  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were no dilutive common shares equivalents
outstanding. 

   Concentration Risks   

 During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company had $21,624 and $37,224, respectively, of sublease income from two sublessees. During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company had $16,660 and $116,662, respectively, in revenue generated from one customer
for consulting services and had interest income from a related party of $0 and $14,460, respectively.

   Income Taxes   

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities
are computed based upon the difference between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the
enacted marginal tax rate applicable when the related asset or liability is expected to be realized or settled. Deferred income
tax expenses or benefits are based on the changes in the asset or liability each period. If available evidence suggests that it
is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required
to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. Future changes in such valuation allowance
are included in the provision for deferred income taxes in the period of change. 

 Deferred income taxes may arise from
temporary differences resulting from income and expense items reported for financial accounting and tax purposes in different periods.
Deferred taxes are classified as current or non-current, depending on the classification of assets and liabilities to which they
relate. Deferred taxes arising from temporary differences that are not related to an asset or liability are classified as current
or non-current depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. 

 The Company applies a more-likely-than-not
recognition threshold for all tax uncertainties. ASC Topic 740 allows the recognition of those tax benefits that have a greater
than 50% likelihood of being sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. As of September 30, 2016 the Company reviewed
its tax positions and determined there were no outstanding or retroactive tax provisions with less than a 50% likelihood of being
sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities. 

 The Company is required to file Federal
and New York state income tax returns. The Company s tax return status will remain open until a tax return has been filed. 

   Advertising costs   

 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.
For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, advertising costs of $1,068 and $16,283, respectively, were included
in general and administrative  expenses. For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015,
advertising costs of $2,502 and $38,792, respectively, were included in general and administrative expenses.

   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

 In May 2014, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 specifies a
comprehensive model to be used in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, and supersedes most of the
current revenue recognition guidance, including industry specific guidance. It applies to all contracts with customers except
those that are specifically within the scope of other FASB topics, and certain of its provisions also apply to transfers of
nonfinancial assets, including in-substance nonfinancial assets that are not an output of an entity's ordinary activities.
The core principal of the model is that revenue is recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the transferring entity expects to be entitled in exchange. To apply the
revenue model, an entity will: 1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, 2) identify the performance obligations in the
contract, 3) determine the transaction price, 4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the
contract, and 5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. For public companies, ASU
2014-09 (updated with ASU 2015-14) is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim reporting periods within
those periods) beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. Upon adoption, entities can choose to use
either a full retrospective or modified approach, as outlined in ASU 2014-09. As compared with current GAAP, ASU 2014-09
requires significantly more disclosures about revenue recognition. The Company has not yet assessed the potential impact of
ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements. 

 In May 2015, the FASB issued amended
guidance on the disclosures for investments in certain equities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). The
amendments remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured
using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures
for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather,
those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient.
The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods within those years. As of
September 30, 2016, the Company does not own any investments in equities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent). 

 In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards update 2016-02,  Leases  ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 requires a lessee to recognize a lease asset representing
its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability for the payments to be made to lessor, on its balance
sheet for all operating leases greater than 12 months. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company has not yet adopted ASU 2016-02 nor assessed its potential impact
on its financial statements.

  NOTE 3   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

 The Company s financial instruments
recorded at fair value have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy. The following
fair value hierarchy tables set forth the Company s recurring fair value measurements at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015.

  NOTE 3   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
(CONTINUED)  

 This hierarchy requires the Company to
use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. For some
products or in certain market conditions, observable inputs used in valuing certain financial assets and liabilities were unavailable.
In situations where there is little, if any, market activity for an asset or liability at the measurement date, the fair value
measurement objective remains to measure the financial asset at the price that would be received by the holder of the financial
asset (or liability) in an orderly transaction that is not a forced liquidation or distressed sale at the measurement date. 

Details of the Company s recurring
fair value measurements are as follow: 

For the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
the Company recorded a net change in unrealized gain on financial instruments of $(501,614) and a net realized gain on financial
instruments of $114,954. For the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a net change in unrealized gain on financial
instruments of $(2,213,158) and a net realized gain on financial instruments of $364,368.

unrealized gain on financial instruments of $(4,069,194) and a net realized loss on financial instruments of $(480,088). 

 During the first quarter of 2014, the
Company purchased shares in a company traded on the OTC Markets for a total of $2,919. The Company currently categorizes these
holdings as Level 3 assets. As of September 30, 2016, this investment is carried at $0.

share and the Call Options expired in August 2015. Such options were immediately exercisable and in February 2015, the
Company exercised 7,244,500 of those options. As of September 30, 2016, the Company owns 1,498,500 of these options to acquire
shares of Twinlab s Common Stock. 

 In September 2014, Twinlab issued
to the Company a Series A Warrant to purchase up to 52,631,579 shares of Twinlab s Common Stock at an exercise price
of $0.76 per share (the  Series A Warrant ) and a Series B Warrant to purchase up to 22,368,421 shares of
Twinlab s Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.76 per share (the  Series B Warrant ). Both the Series A
Warrant and the Series B Warrant were exercisable from October 2014 through October 2017. 

 Twinlab and the Company also entered
into a Common Stock Put Agreement, dated as of September 30, 2014, as amended on December 15, 2014 (the  Put Agreement ).
Pursuant to the Put Agreement, if the Company did not exercise the Series A Warrant by February 16, 2015 and thereafter
at a rate of no less than 1,461,988 shares of Common Stock (the  Minimum Amount ) per month (the  Minimum Rate )
over the term of the Series A Warrant, Twinlab had the right (subject to certain conditions) to require the Company to exercise
the Series A Warrant at the Minimum Rate for the duration of the Series A Warrant. 

 In 2015, the Company sold an aggregate
of 3,976,647 units of Twinlab securities to various unrelated third party accredited investors. Each unit consisted of one share
of (unrestricted) Twinlab common stock and a detachable call option to purchase from the Company, for $1.00 per share, one (restricted)
share of Twinlab common stock. The term of each such call option was three years from the respective unit sale date and the call
option was valued at $0.156 per call option.

 Twinlab and the Company entered into
a Compromise Agreement and Release and an Amendment No. 1 to Series B Warrant, each dated as of May 28, 2015, pursuant
to which, among other things: (a) the Company surrendered the entire remaining-unexercised portion of the Series A Warrant
(51,973,684 warrants) and 4,368,421 of the warrants under the Series B Warrant; (b) the Put Agreement was terminated; (c)
the remaining 18,000,000 warrants under the Series B Warrant were deemed divided into four tranches, each with an associated
date beyond which it would no longer be exercisable: one tranche for 2,000,000 warrant shares (no longer exercisable after November 30,
2015; such tranche of warrants expired mostly unexercised), one for 4,000,000 warrant shares (expired on March 31, 2016), one for
6,000,000 warrant shares (expired on July 31, 2016) and another for 6,000,000 warrant shares (no longer exercisable after November 30,

Company to the extent that upon effective expiration of the second, third and fourth tranches the Company had not exercised the
warrants within such tranches (the  Contingent Call Options ). The three Contingent Call Options would be for a number
of Twinlab shares equal to 25% of such unexercised warrants (i.e., a maximum of 1,000,000 shares if the Company exercised no warrants
from the second tranche, a maximum of 1,500,000 shares if the Company exercised no warrants from the third tranche and a maximum
of 1,500,000 shares if the Company exercised no warrants from the fourth tranche). In addition, Twinlab could not exercise a Contingent
Call Option unless it had satisfied such option s  Liquidity Condition,  namely that for each of the three or
four months before the tranche s effective expiration date Twinlab must have a financial position sufficient to show a 1.15x
fixed charge coverage ratio for a certain trailing period, all as defined by Twinlab s Credit and Security Agreement dated
January 22, 2015. Twinlab also agreed in the Compromise Agreement and Release that, given that the Company has identified,
and may in the future identify, to Twinlab on a confidential basis persons to whom the Company might sell the Company s Twinlab
shares, Twinlab shall not, without the Company s prior written consent, privately place Twinlab equity securities to any
persons theretofore or thereafter first introduced to Twinlab by the Company; provided that Twinlab may, without the Company s
consent, privately place Twinlab equity securities to such a person at any time after the earlier of (a) the date the entire Series B
Warrant has expired and/or been exercised, or (b) the first anniversary of such particular introduction. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company held 6,000,000 warrants under the Series B Warrant. 

 On October 1, 2015, Twinlab and the
Company entered into Amendment No. 1 to Agreement for Limited Waiver of Non-Circumvention Provision and to Compromise Agreement
and Release, pursuant to which a prior agreement calling for contingent payments of cash and equity to the Company was amended
to remove the Company s right to any such contingent payments of cash and equity compensation, and in return the three Contingent
Call Options were immediately cancelled.

11,766 shares, which shares were not issued until the fourth quarter of 2016. 

  NOTE 5   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

   Salary Advance to Related Party    

 In the first quarter of 2016 the Company
paid salary amounts to two of its officers covering the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2016. As a result, the Company recorded
a salary advance - related party of $100,000 at September 30, 2016 in connection with such payments. 

   Short-Term Advances from Related
Party   

 After October 28, 2014 the Company s
controlling stockholder Darin Pastor made advances and direct-payments to assist the Company in covering expenses. In addition,
the amounts of these advances and direct-payments are reimbursable to him upon his demand at any time. At September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the unrepaid balance of such advances and direct-payments was $168,199 and $49,600, respectively. 

   Notes Payable to Related Party   

 On October 28, 2014, the Company entered
into a transaction in which the Company acquired from Darin Pastor certain assets which had been assets of Affluent and assumed
certain liabilities which had been liabilities of Affluent, including liabilities under demand notes in favor of Darin Pastor.
The Company repaid these notes in their entirety on March 11, 2016. On December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal obligation
on such assumed notes was $68,416. The interest rate on the demand notes was 2% per annum. 

  NOTE 6   INCOME TAXES  

 The Company accounts for income taxes
under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted
tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Income tax benefit for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $528,313. Income tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,754,073, which reflected
an effective tax rate of 39.73%, which was greater than the federal statutory rate due to the state income tax expense. 

 The impact of an uncertain income tax
position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit
by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of
being sustained. The Company believes that, as of September 30, 2016, it does not have any uncertain tax positions. 

 The disclosures regarding the Company's
unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 included in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K continue to be relevant
for the period ended September 30, 2016 as to the Company s unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2016.

 FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
forward-looking statements and involves risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, liquidity,
cash flows, and business prospects. Forward-looking statements may appear throughout this report, including without limitation,
the following sections: Part I Item 2  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by words such as  anticipates,   believes,   estimates, 
 expects,   intends,   plans,   predicts,   projects,   will
be,   will continue,   will likely result,  and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements
are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause our actual results
to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences
include, but are not limited to, those discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC) on May 2, 2016, and in particular, the risks discussed under the caption  Risk Factors  in Part I Item 1A thereof,
and those discussed in other documents we file with the SEC. We undertake no obligation to revise or publicly release the results
of any revision to these forward-looking statements, except as required by law. Given these risks and uncertainties, readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. 

  Overview and Outlook  

 We are a diversified company whose primary
business focuses going forward include (a) investing in stock of other companies, (b) identification and pursuit of and capitalization
on opportunities in the minerals and agricultural commodities industries and (c) commercial lending in foreign countries. 

 On August 24, 2016, we entered into an
agreement with a major live animal customer located in Oman to sell that company a total of 10,389,250 hundredweight of
cattle and 3,142,600 hundredweight of sheep at fixed prices. (A  hundredweight  refers to 100 pounds of
livestock.) We would deliver the livestock in 10 equal successive monthly installments with the first delivery to occur on
September 15, 2016. Our customer would make corresponding monthly purchase-price payments. We have matching supply agreements
with suppliers of livestock from Africa, under which we can call upon these suppliers to sell to us these same amounts of
cattle and sheep, also at fixed prices. Accordingly, we occupy a  middleman  arbitrageur position as to this
livestock. 

- 24 - 

There are
significant inherent risks involved in these transactions, including the risks involved with foreign contracts (including the increased
risks of counterparty nonperformance or slow performance, and the possibility of force majeure), the possible need for financing
and the fact that we are inexperienced in transactions in livestock. 

In addition, we and our customer amended our
agreement as of September 25, 2016 to provide that the contractual delivery date for each respective livestock delivery installment
is the 15th of the month  or on such other day or days on or around such 15th day of the month, as may be agreed upon by
the parties , beginning September 2016. In addition, in the amendment we and our customer agreed to reasonably accommodate
each other with regard to the exact day or days of delivery, and we agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to give our customer
at least seven days  notice of our intended actual day or days of delivery (if not the 15th of the month) and of the approximate
hundredweight of cattle and the approximate hundredweight of sheep which we propose to deliver on such day or days (which shall
be within certain livestock quantity ranges). 

So far, deliveries from our supplier and
deliveries to our customer have not been made on time and have not been made in full. Our supplier advised us that due to
drought and famine in the geographic area, it was delayed in fulfilling the livestock quantities ordered pursuant to our
initial option exercise notice. Our ability to meet our timing and delivery undertakings to our customer was correspondingly
impacted. No livestock was delivered to us, and no livestock was delivered by us, until October 26, 2016. We made additional
purchases and resales of livestock against the scheduled September 15, 2016 supply and resale commitments on November 3, 10
and 16, 2016. However, the aggregate quantities in the four deliveries were significantly below the quantities contemplated,
by the original contracts, for September 15, 2016 supply and resale, so additional portions remain to be fulfilled; and no
parts of the scheduled October 15, 2016 supply and resale or of the scheduled November 15, 2016 supply and resale have yet
been fulfilled. It is likely that certain scheduled future delivery and resale dates (e.g., December 15, 2016, etc.) will
also not be achieved during the catch-up process. We have not yet exercised any of our contractual options under our
contracts with our livestock suppliers, for any quantities beyond that needed to fulfill our September 15 resale commitment
to our livestock customer. 

All parties are currently
working cooperatively to fulfill the contracts as soon as practicable. The parties
are at least temporarily not requiring rigorous adherence to the timing and quantity provisions of the contracts, although formal
contractual waivers and forbearances have not been given. On November 17, 2016, we received an $80,000 partial payment from our
livestock customer against the $13,922,192 our customer was obligated to pay us in respect of our actual October 26/November 3/November
10/November 16, 2016 livestock deliveries to the customer. In respect of the four corresponding actual deliveries from our supplier
to us, we were obligated to pay our supplier $2,360,000; of that amount, we have paid our supplier $1,025,000 (including $175,000
which we prepaid in the third quarter of 2016). 

We anticipate that going forward (and especially
during the catch-up process), livestock may be delivered to us at less-than-monthly intervals in such quantities as are available,
and that we would then promptly (i.e., at less-than-monthly intervals) redeliver such available livestock quantities to our customer. 

- 25 - 

As the middleman, it is in our interest to
facilitate informal adjustments and courses of dealing so long as doing so does not unduly prejudice our contractual rights. Investors
are cautioned, however, that the course of performance raises some question regarding whether the total profit ultimately realized
by us will necessarily be as high as initially indicated by the contracts, and regarding whether such profit will necessarily be
realized in the same time periods as initially indicated by the contracts. 

 On September 22, 2016, we entered
into an agreement to sell no less than 50 metric tons of gold (i.e., dor  gold in bar or other form, with the purity
of the gold in said dor  being at least 95.8%) at a fixed price to a privately held trading company located in the
Sydney, Australia metropolitan area. The agreement contemplated such gold would be delivered and purchased in periodic
installments, but specific times and quantities for respective deliveries of gold were not fixed in the agreement. The
contract stated that no gold delivery would be made by us before December 15, 2016, and that deliveries thereafter would be
on dates (through September 30, 2019) and in amounts (each not less than 15 kilograms and not more than 2,500 kilograms) as
may be agreed upon for the parties  mutual convenience. To the extent that through no fault of our customer less than
50 metric tons of gold has been delivered by September 30, 2018, our customer s obligation to purchase any remaining
portion of the 50 metric tons will be relieved on such date. We have not yet established with our customer the dates or
quantities for any particular delivery installments. 

 The agreement provided that our
customer would be responsible to, as a closing condition for any delivery of gold to the customer, provide us in advance with
a letter of credit from Westpac (a major Australian bank) for the entire purchase price amount with respect to the particular
delivery. Our intention is to make arrangements with suppliers of gold on like delivery dates and in like quantities so as to
enable essentially simultaneous resales of gold to our customer, thereby enabling us to occupy a profitable
 middleman  position such as the livestock contracts were structured to do. There can be no assurance that we
will succeed in doing so. We have not yet entered into contracts with any gold suppliers. 

 We may require substantial working capital
resources to fund our purchases of livestock and gold from our suppliers pending our receipt of payment from our customers upon
our resales. 

 We are also working toward other substantial
opportunities in the precious minerals, mining and agricultural commodities industries and energy-related development projects,
as well as other substantial international opportunities. We can give no assurance that such projects will come to fruition or,
if any one or more of them do come to fruition, that they will be successful. 

 Until the second quarter of 2016,
we considered our primary business focus to be investing our own capital to acquire the outstanding equity securities of
other companies. We sought, and seek, to discover, unlock and grow value in privately-held or illiquid companies. We sought,
and seek, to work closely and constructively with the management and boards of the other companies. While we do not manage
the day-to-day operations of these companies, we sought, and seek, to maintain a thorough understanding of how they operate
and evaluate their performance and prospects on an ongoing basis. 

- 26 - 

We may also seek to actively trade in
our strategic investment positions and/or enter into private securities transactions with regard to those positions, to capitalize
on price fluctuations and realize profits or minimize losses. 

 We were initially formed to design and
sell mobile apps for smartphones and other mobile platforms such as tablets. We never launched an active business based on this
focus. 

 During the third quarter of 2013, we
refocused ourselves as a financial services company. 

 On January 15, 2014, in support of our
financial services business focus, we effected a reverse triangular merger whereby Capstone Affluent Strategies, Inc. ( Affluent ),
a California corporation, became our wholly owned subsidiary. Affluent, a financial services company, had been wholly owned by
Darin Pastor. 

 In March 2014, we refocused ourselves
again, to the business model which was our primary focus until the second quarter of 2016. 

 On May 14, 2014, we effectively unwound
the Affluent merger transaction, due to Affluent s inability to produce audited financial statements as required and the
change in our business focus. In October 2014, we acquired from Darin Pastor certain Affluent assets and assumed certain Affluent
liabilities. (Affluent had been dissolved earlier in 2014.) 

 Currently our primary strategic investment
position is in securities of Twinlab Consolidated Holdings, Inc. ( Twinlab ). In August 2014, we purchased 10,987,500
shares of common stock of Twinlab in private transactions from 25 shareholders, for nominal consideration. Additionally, in
August 2014, we purchased options to acquire 8,743,000 currently-outstanding shares of Twinlab s common stock (collectively,
the  2014 Call Options ) from 14 shareholders in a private transaction, for nominal consideration. The 2014 Call Options
exercise price was $0.0001 per share and the 2014 Call Options expiration date was August 2015. (In February 2015, we exercised
the Call Options. Optionors honored the exercise as to 7,244,500 Twinlab shares. Other optionors have not yet honored the exercise,
as to at least 1,498,500 Twinlab shares. We intend, if necessary, to file suit to enforce the exercises as to those shares.) 

 On September 30, 2014, Twinlab issued
to us a Series A Warrant to purchase up to 52,631,579 shares of Twinlab common stock at an exercise price of $0.76 per share (the
 Series A Warrant ), and a Series B Warrant to purchase up to 22,368,421 shares of Twinlab common stock at an exercise
price of $0.76 per share (the  Series B Warrant ). By their original terms, the Series A Warrant and the Series B Warrant
were both exercisable from October 2014 through October 2017. 

- 27 - 

On September 30, 2014, Twinlab and we
also entered into a Common Stock Put Agreement (as amended on December 15, 2014, the  Put Agreement ). Pursuant to
the Put Agreement, if we did not exercise the Series A Warrant by February 16, 2015 and thereafter at a rate of no less than 1,461,988
shares of Twinlab common stock (the  Minimum Amount ) per month (the  Minimum Rate ) over the term of the
Series A Warrant, Twinlab had the right (subject to certain conditions) to require us to exercise the Series A Warrant at the Minimum
Rate for the duration of the Series A Warrant. In the event Twinlab exercised its right to require us to exercise the Series A
Warrant, the purchase price per share of Twinlab common stock thereunder would have been $0.775. We did not exercise the  Minimum
Amount  of shares per the Put Agreement. In April 2015 we exercised the Series A Warrant as to 657,895 Twinlab shares. 

 On October 28, 2014, we entered into
a transaction in which we acquired from Darin Pastor certain assets which had been assets of Affluent and assumed certain liabilities
which had been liabilities of Affluent, including liabilities under notes in favor of Darin Pastor. At December 31, 2015, the outstanding
principal amount of such assumed notes was $68,416. We completed the full repayment of such assumed notes on March 11, 2016. In
a transaction related to the October 28, 2014 transaction, the crossing lines of credit entered into between Affluent and us in
2013 were cancelled. At the time of the cancellation, we had a $1,089,617 net receivable from Darin Pastor (as Affluent s
successor) under the crossing lines of credit; accordingly, this $1,089,617 was applied to reduce the liabilities under the notes
in favor of Darin Pastor, which had been liabilities of Affluent and which we assumed. As a result of such October 28, 2014 and
related transactions, we recorded an expense item of $1,089,617 and we were deemed (for accounting purposes) to have paid a dividend
to Darin Pastor in the amount of $1,484,204. 

 In November 2014, we sold 436,681 of
our Twinlab shares for approximately $1,000,000. 

 During the three months ended March
31, 2015, we sold an aggregate of 3,976,647 units of Twinlab securities to various unrelated third party accredited investors.
Each unit consisted of one share of (unrestricted) Twinlab common stock and a detachable call option ( Third-Party Call Options )
to purchase from us, for $1.00 per share, one (restricted) share of Twinlab common stock. The term of each such call option was
three years from the respective unit sale date. In each case, the sale price per unit was $0.76 and the call option was valued
at $0.156 per call option. (Our references to  unrestricted  shares mean free-trading shares, and our references to
 restricted  shares mean shares that are not free-trading.). 

 In addition, in 2015 we sold 2,078,255
Twinlab shares (without any associated Third-Party Call Options) for $1,579,480. 

 In total, during 2015 we sold Twinlab
securities for $4,601,732. 

- 28 - 

On May 28, 2015, we entered into a Compromise
Agreement and Release and an Amendment No. 1 to Series B Warrant, each between Twinlab and us. Pursuant to these two agreements: 

-  
      The Put Agreement was terminated.   

-  
      We surrendered the entire remaining-unexercised portion of the Series A Warrant (51,973,684 warrants).   

-  
      We surrendered 4,368,421 of the warrants under the Series B Warrant.   

-  
      The remaining 18,000,000 warrants under the Series B Warrant were deemed divided into four tranches, each with an associated date beyond which it would no longer be exercisable: one tranche for 2,000,000 warrant shares (no longer exercisable after November 30, 2015); one for 4,000,000 warrant shares (no longer exercisable after March 31, 2016); one for 6,000,000 warrant shares (no longer exercisable after July 31, 2016); and another for 6,000,000 warrant shares (no longer exercisable after November 30, 2016).   

-  
      We granted Twinlab three contingent call options, at $0.01 per share, to acquire Twinlab shares from us to the extent that upon effective expiration of the second, third and fourth tranches we had not exercised the warrants within such tranches (the  Contingent Call Options ). The three Contingent Call Options would be for a number of Twinlab shares equal to 25% of such unexercised warrants (i.e., a maximum of 1,000,000 shares if we exercised no warrants from the second tranche, a maximum of 1,500,000 shares if we exercised no warrants from the third tranche and a maximum of 1,500,000 shares if we exercised no warrants from the fourth tranche). In addition, Twinlab cannot exercise a Contingent Call Option unless it has satisfied such option s  Liquidity Condition,  namely that for each of the three or four months before the tranche s effective expiration date Twinlab must have a financial position sufficient to show a 1.15x fixed charge coverage ratio for a certain trailing period, all as defined by Twinlab s Credit and Security Agreement dated January 22, 2015..   

-  
      Given that we have identified, and may in the future identify, to Twinlab on a confidential basis persons to whom we might sell our Twinlab shares, Twinlab agreed that it shall not, without our prior written consent, privately place Twinlab equity securities to any persons theretofore or thereafter first introduced to Twinlab by us (the  Noncircumvention Provision ); provided that Twinlab may, without our consent, privately place Twinlab equity securities to such a person at any time after the earlier of (a) the date the entire Series B Warrant has expired and/or been exercised, or (b) the first anniversary of such particular introduction.   

- 29 - 

As a result of these two agreements,
our investment position in Twinlab as of immediately after the two agreements was as follows: 

On July 5, 2015, Twinlab and we entered
into an Agreement for Limited Waiver of Noncircumvention Provision (the  Limited Waiver Agreement ), pursuant to which
we agreed to waive the Noncircumvention Provision as to a particular potential investor (B. Thomas Golisano) whom we had introduced
to Twinlab in June 2015 and to whom the Noncircumvention Provision would otherwise apply, in exchange for substantial compensation
in cash and Twinlab warrants calculated on the basis of the size and pricing of such investor s purchase(s) of Twinlab securities. 

- 30 - 

On October 1, 2015, Twinlab and we entered
into an Amendment No. 1 to Agreement for Limited Waiver of Non-Circumvention Provision and to Compromise Agreement and Release,
pursuant to which the Limited Waiver Agreement was amended to remove our right to any compensation for the waiver of the Noncircumvention
Provision as to B. Thomas Golisano and his affiliates, and the Compromise Agreement and Release was amended to eliminate the three
Contingent Call Options. 

 During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 we sold 2,456,581 Twinlab shares (without any associated Third-Party Call Options) for $1,867,000. 

 As of September 30, 2016, our position
in Twinlab securities was as follows, and we had no contingent liabilities to Twinlab: 

-  
      We held 10,599,626 outstanding Twinlab shares (9,612,784 unrestricted, free-trading Twinlab shares and 986,842 restricted Twinlab shares).   

-  
      We held 6,000,000 warrants under the Series B Warrant, at a $0.76 per share exercise price, with an effective expiration date of November 30, 2016.    

-  
      The Registration Rights Agreement remained in full force and effect to enable the Securities Act registration of all Twinlab shares issued upon prior or future exercises of our Warrants.   

-  
      We had a claim against third-party optionors for delivery to us of 1,498,500 Twinlab shares against the Call Options which they granted to us and which we have exercised.   

-  
      We were contingently obligated to deliver Twinlab shares to our accredited-investor counterparties under the 3,976,647 Third-Party Call options if and when the detachable call options are exercised.   

-  
      We had no actual or potential Put liability or Contingent Call Option liability.   
 
 At September 30, 2016, the fair value
of the liability under the 3,976,647 Third-Party Call Options was recorded on our balance sheet at $462,558.  

 The determination of the fair value
of our Twinlab stock and derivative securities as of September 30, 2016 is highly significant to our balance sheet and our income
statement. In determining the fair value, our Board of Directors relied upon a valuation report dated March 2, 2016 by FFG Valuations,
Inc., an independent third party valuation firm. This valuation report, which we commissioned, values Twinlab common stock at $0.758
per share as of December 31, 2015. Twinlab stock is essentially illiquid; accordingly, valuations such as FFG s are opinions,
and other observers might have valued Twinlab stock differently if they chose to emphasize other factors than FFG did. For example,
Twinlab issued significant numbers of shares in the second half of 2015 at prices well below $0.758 per share. If we used in our
financial statements a valuation of Twinlab stock (as of September 30, 2016) which was well below $0.758 per share, with corresponding
valuations for our Twinlab derivative securities, our net assets as of September 30, 2016 would have been significantly reduced
and we would have had a significantly larger net loss in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016. 

- 31 - 

In July 2015, in exchange for $277,500,
we acquired a 20% interest in privately-held Western New York real estate companies LC Strategic Realty, LLC and LC Strategic Holdings,
LLC, as well as in all other business conducted by the firms  majority holders to the extent such other business has a primary
focus on (a) real estate (subject to the exclusion of certain specified projects), (b) media/entertainment/show business, or (c)
endorsements/advertisements/personal appearances/use of likeness/ monetization of celebrity. 

 On June 17 and 18, 2015, we filed
a Form 4 and an amended Schedule 13D statement to report a June 10, 2015 sale by us of 13,157,895 shares of Twinlab common
stock to a third party. The third party did not timely honor its payment obligation under the sale contract and we have treated
the transaction as a non-event for financial reporting purposes. On December 18, 2015, we terminated the sale contract. 

 We continue to investigate possible
acquisitions of positions in new businesses, securities and assets, and evaluate the retention and disposition of our existing
holdings.  Changes in the mix of our businesses and investments should be expected. We have in the past taken preliminary
steps toward acquisitions and investments in various companies, which transactions were never completed, and we have made an unsuccessful
investment (in Blackcraft Cult, Inc. common stock) which we continue to hold but have written down to a zero valuation. 

  Results of Operations for the Quarterly
Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

   Revenues.    Total
revenues (excluding gain and loss on investment securities) for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $21,624 (sublease
income) and $18,460. The 2015 period included services income of $16,660. Due to our current business focus, we do not expect to
regularly generate material amounts of services income. 

   Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss)
on Financial Instruments  . We recorded a $114,954 realized gain on financial instruments for the quarter ended September
30, 2016, as a result of our sales of Twinlab shares to third parties during the quarter for $115,000. 

 We also recorded a $(501,614) change
in unrealized gain on financial instruments for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the July 31, 2016
expiration of 6,000,000 of our Twinlab common stock warrants, as well as reduction in the valuation of our remaining Twinlab warrants
as the remaining time until their expiration date decreases, and the transformation of unrealized gain into realized gain upon
our sales of Twinlab shares to third parties during the quarter. 

 The overall net loss on financial instruments
for the quarter was $386,660. 

- 32 - 

If our assessments/estimates of the
fair value of our holdings of Twinlab securities change from quarter to quarter, there will be significant changes in our unrealized
gain on such holdings, which in turn would result in significant gain or loss on our statement of operations for the quarter in
question. At December 31, 2014, March 31, 2015 and September 30, 2015, our determination was that the fair value of Twinlab common
stock was $0.76 per Twinlab share. However, at September 30, 2015, our determination was that the fair value of Twinlab common
stock was $0.65 per Twinlab share and at December 31, 2015, March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, our determination
was that the fair value of Twinlab common stock was $0.758 per Twinlab share. We ourselves continued to sell Twinlab shares for
$0.76 in the third quarter of 2016. 

 We first acquired ownership of any Twinlab
securities in the third quarter of 2014. 

   Personnel Expense .   Personnel
expense for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $230,527 and $137,048, respectively; the increase in 2016 was primarily
due to salary payments of $360,000 to Darin Pastor and $40,000 to Tracy Pastor in the first quarter of 2016. These amounts are
attributable to the entire 2016 year, so $100,000 of such amounts were recognized as personnel expense for the third quarter of
2016 and $100,000 of such amounts were recorded at September 30, 2016 as a salary advance - related party asset. Before 2016, we
had held the salaries of our most senior officers at very low levels. 

   Professional Fees .   Professional
fees for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $144,990 and $318,808, respectively, each primarily due to legal fees
for preparing documents for production as required by legal process. 

   General and Administrative.    General
and administrative expenses (excluding personnel expense and professional fees) for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
were $593,677 and $451,862, respectively; the increase in 2016 was primarily due to overseas business development efforts. 

  Results of Operations for the Nine
Month Periods Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

   Revenues.    Total
revenues (excluding gain and loss on investment securities) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $37,224
and $132,922. There was $37,224 of sublease income from two sublessees in the 2016 period. The 2015 period included services income
of $116,662. Due to our current business focus, we do not expect to regularly generate material amounts of services income. 

   Realized and Unrealized Gain (Loss)
on Financial Instruments  . We recorded a $1,866,263 realized gain on financial instruments for the nine month period ended
September 30, 2016, as a result of our sales of Twinlab shares to third parties during the nine month period for $1,867,000. 

 We also recorded a $(3,191,438) change
in unrealized gain on financial instruments for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, primarily as a result of the March
31, 2016 expiration of 4,000,000 of our Twinlab common stock warrants and the July 31, 2016 expiration of 6,000,000 of our Twinlab
common stock warrants. 

 The overall net loss on financial instruments
for the nine month period was $1,325,175. 

- 33 - 

If our assessments/estimates of the
fair value of our holdings of Twinlab securities change from quarter to quarter, there will be significant changes in our net unrealized
gain on such holdings, which in turn would result in significant gain or loss on our statement of operations for the quarter in
question. At December 31, 2014, March 31, 2015 and June 30, 2015, our determination was that the fair value of Twinlab common stock
was $0.76 per Twinlab share. However, at September 30, 2015, our determination was that the fair value of Twinlab common stock
was $0.65 per Twinlab share and at December 31, 2015, March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, our determination was
that the fair value of Twinlab common stock was $0.758 per Twinlab share. We ourselves continued to sell Twinlab shares for $0.76
in the first, second and third quarters of 2016. 

 We first acquired ownership of any Twinlab
securities in the third quarter of 2014. 

   Personnel Expense .   Personnel
expense for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $582,388 and $228,593, respectively; the increase in 2016
was primarily due to salary payments of $360,000 to Darin Pastor and $40,000 to Tracy Pastor in the first quarter of 2016. These
amounts are attributable to the entire 2016 year, so $100,000 of such amounts were recognized as personnel expense for each of
the first, second and third quarters of 2016 and $100,000 of such amounts were recorded at September 30, 2016 as a salary advance
- related party asset. Before 2016, we had held the salaries of our most senior officers at very low levels. 

   Professional Fees .   Professional
fees for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $681,276 and $920,402, respectively, each primarily due
to legal fees for preparing documents for production as required by legal process. The reduction in the 2014 period was primarily
due to a lower amount of accounting fees. 

   General and Administrative.    General
and administrative expenses (excluding personnel expense and professional fees) for the nine month periods ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 were $1,867,125 and $760,187, respectively; the increase in 2016 was primarily due to overseas business development
efforts. 

  Liquidity and Capital Resources  

 As of September 30, 2016, we had $155,319
in cash and cash equivalents, Twinlab and other securities owned which we recorded at a $9,812,979 fair value, and $63,930 of deposits.  There
is no active liquid public market for our Twinlab or other securities. 

 Our contracts for the purchase and resale
of livestock and gold contemplate periodic purchases from our suppliers and essentially simultaneous resales to our customers.
Our experience under our livestock contracts so far has indicated that our purchases and our corresponding resales of livestock
will not necessarily occur on the scheduled delivery dates and will not necessarily include full delivery of the scheduled quantities
of livestock. No deliveries have yet been scheduled under our gold agreement. 

- 34 - 

We may require substantial working capital
resources to fund our purchases of livestock and gold from our suppliers pending our receipt of payment from our customers upon
our resales. Also, any unpredictability in the timing and size of our trading profits would have a positive effect on our working
capital and our ability to make and honor other major commitments. We anticipate obtaining additional financing to fund operations
from our operating profits, if any, and through common stock offerings, sales of Twinlab stock and sales of future-acquired strategic
investment securities, and bank loans, to the extent available. (During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we received a commitment
for a $26,072,891 secured revolving line of credit from a foreign bank; however, this loan facility has not yet been documented
with definitive agreements.) There can be no assurance we will be successful in raising the necessary funds to execute our business
plan. 

 In the third quarter of 2016, we received
$1,674,250 in cash from sales of our newly-issued common stock in a private placement to accredited investors (including $10,000
attributable to subscriptions for which shares were not issued until the fourth quarter of 2016). Additional sales and issuances
in this private placement have been made in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

 The realization of cash proceeds, if
any, from private placements of our own shares and/or on sales of our securities positions would likely be  bunchy, 
unpredictable and irregular. We can make no assurances and therefore we may incur operating losses and/or negative cash flows in
one or more future periods.   

 The September 30, 2016 balance sheet
included a $462,558 liability item arising from the Third-Party Call Options we granted to certain accredited investors in connection
with certain of our 2015 sales of Twinlab common stock to such investors. Our actual risk under the Third-Party Call Options would
be magnified if, due to sales of Twinlab common stock, we do not have as many Twinlab shares as the number of shares we could be
obliged to deliver under the Third-Party Call Options (i.e., to the extent we in effect are  short  Twinlab shares).
If we wish to avoid being  short  Twinlab shares in the manner just described, it may be necessary for us to purchase
and/or hold Twinlab shares through the expiration date of the Third-Party Call Options, which would tie up a large amount of otherwise
available cash. If insufficient cash is available for this purpose, it may be necessary for us to run the risk of having what in
effect is a short position. 

 The $2,797,231 deferred tax liability
item on our September 30, 2016 balance sheet represents the income taxes we would owe if we sold, during tax years in which our
taxable income levels were large enough to support such current income taxes, all the Twinlab securities which we held as of September
30, 2016, at a price resulting in realization of all of the unrealized gain we recorded for such assets on our balance sheet (based
on our fair value assessment as of September 30, 2016). No such taxes would be actually payable unless and until after we sell
the Twinlab securities, and the amount of actual taxes payable would depend on the actual sales prices. 

 From time to time after October 28,
2014 our controlling stockholder Darin Pastor has made advances and direct-payments to assist us in covering expenses; he is not
obligated to make any such advances and direct-payments and there can be no assurance that any such advances and direct-payments
will continue. In addition, the amounts of these advances and direct-payments are reimbursable to him upon his demand at any time.
At September 30, 2016, $168,199 of such advances and direct-payments had not yet been reimbursed. 

- 35 - 

The entire $68,416 remaining balance
on the notes payable to Darin Pastor, which we assumed as part of our October 2014 transaction involving assets and liabilities
of the former Capstone Affluent Strategies, Inc., plus $19 of accrued but unpaid interest, was repaid on March 11, 2016. 

 We remind readers that our prospects
must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by emerging companies. Also, our limited
operating history makes predictions of future operating results and cash needs difficult to ascertain. 

 The following table provides detailed
information about our net cash flow for the respective first nine months of our 2016 and 2015 fiscal years.   

Operating activities   

 Net cash used in operating activities
was $1,705,963 for the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to our $2,665,012 after-tax net loss for that nine month period.
Although our sales of Twinlab securities in the first nine months of 2016 generated $1,867,000 in cash proceeds, the $(3,191,438)
net change in unrealized gain on financial instruments, which was primarily due to the expiration of a total of 10,000,000 of our
Twinlab warrants, was a noncash item. Our determination was that the fair value of Twinlab common stock was $0.758 per share as
of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

 For the first nine month period of 2015,
net cash provided by operating activities was $1,464,930, despite our $3,816,942 after-tax net loss for that nine month period.
Although our sales of Twinlab securities in the first nine months of 2015 generated substantial cash proceeds, we did not record
an overall net gain on financial instruments on such sales to the extent that the sales prices (ranging from $0.60 to $0.76 per
share) were below or equal to the fair value we had determined for our Twinlab stock and at which we were carrying the Twinlab
stock on our books.

Financing activities   

 Net cash provided by financing activities
in the first nine months of 2016 was primarily attributable to $1,674,250 received in the third quarter of 2016 from accredited
investors in a private placement of our newly-issued common stock (including $10,000 attributable to subscriptions for which shares
were not issued until the fourth quarter of 2016). Our final repayment of notes owed to our controlling stockholder Darin Pastor
was more than offset by a net increase in Darin Pastor s advances and direct-payments to us during the nine-month period
to assist us in covering expenses; he is not obligated to make any such advances and direct-payments and there can be no assurance
that any such advances and direct-payments will continue. In addition, the amounts of these advances and direct-payments are reimbursable
to him upon his demand at any time. 

 The net cash used in financing activities
in the first nine months of 2015 was primarily attributable to repayments on notes payable to Darin Pastor. 

  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

 We did not have any off-balance sheet
arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
investors. 

  Critical Accounting Policies and
Estimates  

 The preparation of our financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the accounting and financial reporting conventions
of the investment company industry requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets, liabilities, revenues,
and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base our estimates and judgments on historical
experience and on various other assumptions, we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.  Future events, however,
may differ markedly from our current expectations and assumptions. 

     Item 3.   Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

  This item is not applicable,
as we are classified as a smaller reporting company.  

    Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

 Disclosure controls and procedures are
controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted
under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

- 37 - 

As required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Securities Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2016 we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of our disclosure controls and procedures.  This evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, who concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
The errors which required the restatement of financial statements and the amendments of periodic reports, as reported and summarized
in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on November 13, 2014 (as amended on November 24, 2014) and in such amendments and as further
stated in the following paragraph of this item, were, in their judgment, not due to ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures. 

  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

 Our management is responsible for preparing
our annual consolidated financial statements and for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.
Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as
a process designed by, or under the supervision of, a company s principal executive and principal financial officers and
effected by a company s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: 

Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;   

Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and   

Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.   
 
 All internal control systems, no matter
how well designed, have inherent limitations and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the
control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and
the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect
to financial statement preparation and presentation. 

 Our management assessed the effectiveness
of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making our assessment, we used the framework and
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control-Integrated
Framework in 2014. Based on that assessment, our management has identified certain material weaknesses in our internal control
over financial reporting. 

- 38 - 

Our management concluded that as of
September 30, 2016 our internal control over financial reporting was not effective, and that material weaknesses existed in the
following areas as of September 30, 2016: 

(1)  
       
      we do not employ full time in-house personnel with the technical knowledge to identify and address some of the reporting issues surrounding certain complex or non-routine transactions. With respect to material, complex and non-routine transactions, management has and will continue to seek guidance from third-party experts and/or consultants to gain a thorough understanding of these transactions;   
 
      (2)  
       
      we have inadequate segregation of duties consistent with the control objectives including but not limited to the disbursement process, transaction or account changes, and the performance of account reconciliations and approval;   
 
      (3)  
       
      we have ineffective controls over the period end financial disclosure and reporting process caused by reliance on third-party experts and/or consultants and insufficient accounting staff; and   
 
      (4)  
       
      we do not have a functioning audit committee of the Board of Directors and our Board of Directors, in its performance of the functions generally associated with audit committees, lacks a majority of (indeed, lacks any) independent members and lacks a majority of (indeed, lacks any) outside directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls, approvals and procedures.   
 
 To attempt to remediate these material
weaknesses (which have also been noted during previous quarterly assessments), we have in previous quarters increased (and plan
to enhance in the future) our use of external accounting services, adopted in previous quarters (and plan to further adopt in the
future) policies to improve timely reviews by management and coordination with accounting consultants, and are increasing our use
of experienced corporate and securities legal counsel, and we plan to add financial department employees as our resource priorities
allow. We believe these actions will continue to improve items (1), (2) and (3) noted above. 

  Changes in Internal Control Over
Financial Reporting  

 No substantial changes in our internal
control over financial reporting occurred during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or  are
 reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

- 39 - 

PART II  

    Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

 We are not a party to any material legal proceedings. 

    Item 1A. Risk Factors  

 This item is not applicable,
as we are classified as a smaller reporting company. To better inform the readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, however,
we refer to the Risk Factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on May 2, 2016, and to certain other risks identified within this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 

 In addition, investors should
take note that we carry our strategic investments at market value or, if there is no readily available market value, at fair value
as determined by our board of directors in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
and the accounting and financial reporting conventions of the investment company industry. Typically, there is not a liquid public
market for the securities of the companies in which we intend to invest. Where a liquid public market exists we would simply use
market value, but where there is no public market or where the public market is illiquid (with the result that the reported public
trading is not a reliable indicator of true value), we will value these securities quarterly at fair value as determined in good
faith by our Board of Directors. 

 Because such valuations are inherently
uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates, our determinations of fair value may differ
materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these securities existed. Due to this uncertainty, our
determinations of the fair value of our trading positions on a given date may be materially understated or overstated compared
to the value that we may ultimately realize upon the sale of those positions. Indeed, our determinations might be inaccurate even
as of the determination date. 

 There is no guarantee that we
will be able to realize the fair value as evaluated by our Board of Directors upon disposition of the asset. 

 Given that a large percentage
of our assets and net income are currently based on our fair value figures for Twinlab securities, readers should be especially
aware of the risk. 

 In addition, investors
should be aware that the opportunities we are pursuing in  the livestock trading and minerals industries tend to
be exceptionally high-risk, and investors should also be aware that the initial transactions called for under our
livestock supply and sale agreements have not yet been fully performed.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and
Use of Proceeds   

 In a private placement of our newly-issued
common stock to accredited investors at $0.85 per share, we received an aggregate of $1,074,250 in cash on various dates in the
third quarter of 2016; and in exchange we issued 1,252,063 shares of our common stock in the third quarter of 2016 and 11,766 shares
of our common stock in the fourth quarter of 2016. (In addition, in July 2016, we received $600,000 in cash in respect of 705,882
shares of our common stock which had been subscribed for in this private placement, but not yet paid for, in the second quarter
of 2016. These 705,882 shares were issued in the third quarter of 2016.) 

 These stock issuances were exempt from
the registration requirement of the Securities Act, by virtue of the exemption provided in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. 

    Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities  

 None. 

    Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures  

 Not applicable. 

    Item 5. Other Information  

 Not applicable.

inability due to general industry
wide shortages to obtain fuel, power, raw materials, labor or transportation facilities. If, due to any event of force majeure,
either party shall be unable to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, the affected party shall immediately notify the other
party of such inability and of the period during which such inability is expected to continue, shall use reasonable commercial
efforts to cure and remedy such non-performance and the time for performance shall be extended for a number of days equal to the
duration of the force majeure, and the parties shall meet promptly to determine an equitable solution to the effects of such event. 

   10. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.    

 This Agreement is the entire agreement
between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous negotiations,
understandings, commitments and agreements (whether oral or in writing) with regard to the subject matter hereof. No waivers, changes,
alterations or substitutions shall be permitted unless the same shall be notified in writing and signed by both parties. The English
language version of this Agreement shall be controlling over any version in any other language. 

   11. SEVERABILITY.   

 This Agreement is severable. When
possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law;
but if any provision of this Agreement is determined by a final and binding court or arbitration judgment to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable to any extent, such provision shall not be affected or impaired up to the limits of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability; the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected
or impaired in any way; and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid, illegal and unenforceable provision
(or portion of provision) with a valid, legal and enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this
Agreement, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or portion of provision). 

   12. APPLICABLE LAW AND BINDING
ARBITRATION.    

 Any and all disputes or controversies
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be exclusively and finally resolved by binding arbitration (using the English
language) in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the International Chamber of Commerce then in effect, in New York
City, USA. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted promptly and in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce then in effect. The expenses of any arbitration, including the reasonable attorney fees of the
prevailing party, shall be borne by the party deemed to be at fault or on a pro-rata basis should the arbitration conclude in a
finding of mutual fault. 

 This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles
that require the application of the law of a different state or country). The parties agree that the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall be inapplicable to this Agreement and transactions hereunder and thereunder. 

 Each party recognizes that the
covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this Agreement are necessary and critical to protect
the legitimate interests of the other party, that the other party would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of
such covenants and agreements and the assurance of continued performance as set forth in this Agreement, and that a party s
breach or threatened breach of such covenants and agreements may cause the other 

party irreparable harm and significant
injury, the amount of which will be extremely difficult to estimate and ascertain, thus potentially making any remedy at law or
in damages inadequate. Therefore, each party confirms and agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek on an interim or
permanent basis specific performance, an order restraining any breach or threatened breach of any or all provisions of this Agreement,
and any other equitable relief (including but not limited to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief), all without
need to post any bond or security, and in addition to and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such other party at law
or in equity. 

 Neither party shall commence any
court proceeding or action against the other to resolve any dispute, except to enforce an arbitral award rendered pursuant to this
Section. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located
in New York City, USA. In addition, the party in whose favor an arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Section was granted shall
have the right to enforce such arbitral award in any court of any country which it wishes. 

 To the extent that any of the provisions
of this Section 12 are forbidden by a mandatory provision of an applicable  [***]  6
   law, the mandatory provision of the applicable  [***]  law shall
apply instead of the forbidden portion of this Section 12. 

   13. ELECTRONIC COPIES; COUNTERPARTS.   

 This Agreement may be executed
and delivered in counterparts (portable document format (.pdf)/electronic transmission included), each of which shall constitute
an original document, but both of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of a portable document format (.pdf)
copy of an executed signature page of this Agreement (or of any other notice, report, request, approval or consent required or
permitted to be given under this Agreement) shall be as valid, for all purposes of contract formation and evidence and otherwise,
as delivery of an executed original. 

   14. ASSIGNMENT.   

 Either party may assign its rights
under this Agreement. Either party may assign its duties, liabilities and/or obligations under this Agreement, but the effect of
doing so is that the assignee will become responsible for such duties, liabilities and/or obligations and the assignor will remain
jointly and severally responsible for such duties, liabilities and/or obligations. 

   15. FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES.   

 Each party is responsible for its
own fees, costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. 

   16. BEST EFFORTS; FURTHER
ASSURANCES.   

 The parties hereby covenant and
agree to use their respective best efforts to, without the necessity of any further consideration, execute, acknowledge and deliver
any and all such other documents and instruments and take any such other action as may be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate, make effective, comply with and carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement.

17. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES.

Each of the parties hereto is an
independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be deemed to constitute a partnership, agency, employer-employee
or joint venture relationship between the parties. Neither party shall have the right to, and each party agrees not to purport
to, incur any debts, liabilities or obligation for which the other is or will be responsible, or make any commitments or contracts

Agreement, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or portion of provision).

prevailing party, shall be borne by the party deemed to be at fault or on a pro-rata basis should the arbitration conclude in a
finding of mutual fault. 

 This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles
that require the application of the law of a different state or country). The parties agree that the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall be inapplicable to this Agreement and transactions hereunder and thereunder. 

 Each party recognizes that the
covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this Agreement are necessary and critical to protect
the legitimate interests of the other party, that the other party would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of
such covenants and agreements and the assurance of continued performance as set forth in this Agreement, and that a party s
breach or threatened breach of such covenants and agreements may cause the other 

party irreparable harm and significant
injury, the amount of which will be extremely difficult to estimate and ascertain, thus potentially making any remedy at law or
in damages inadequate. Therefore, each party confirms and agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek on an interim or
permanent basis specific performance, an order restraining any breach or threatened breach of any or all provisions of this Agreement,
and any other equitable relief (including but not limited to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief), all without
need to post any bond or security, and in addition to and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such other party at law
or in equity. 

 Neither party shall commence any
court proceeding or action against the other to resolve any dispute, except to enforce an arbitral award rendered pursuant to this
Section. For all purposes of this Agreement, the parties hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located
in New York City, USA. In addition, the party in whose favor an arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Section was granted shall
have the right to enforce such arbitral award in any court of any country which it wishes. 

   13. ELECTRONIC COPIES; COUNTERPARTS.   

 This Agreement may be executed
and delivered in counterparts (portable document format (.pdf)/electronic transmission included), each of which shall constitute
an original document, but both of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of a portable document format (.pdf)
copy of an executed signature page of this Agreement (or of any other notice, report, request, approval or consent required or
permitted to be given under this Agreement) shall be as valid, for all purposes of contract formation and evidence and otherwise,
as delivery of an executed original. 

   14. ASSIGNMENT.   

 Either party may assign its rights
under this Agreement. Either party may assign its duties, liabilities and/or obligations under this Agreement, but the effect of
doing so is that the assignee will become responsible for such duties, liabilities and/or obligations and the assignor will remain
jointly and severally responsible for such duties, liabilities and/or obligations. 

   15. FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES.   

 Each party is responsible for its
own fees, costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. 

   16. BEST EFFORTS; FURTHER
ASSURANCES.   

 The parties hereby covenant and
agree to use their respective best efforts to, without the necessity of any further consideration, execute, acknowledge and deliver
any and all such other documents and instruments and take any such other action as may be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate, make effective, comply with and carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement. 

   17. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES.

Each of the parties hereto is an
independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be deemed to constitute a partnership, agency, employer-employee
or joint venture relationship between the parties. Neither party shall have the right to, and each party agrees not to purport
to, incur any debts, liabilities or obligation for which the other is or will be responsible, or make any commitments or contracts
for the other. Each party represents and warrants that it has not incurred 

any debts, liabilities or obligations
for which the other is or will be responsible, or made any commitments or contracts for the other. 
 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties
have set their hands to this Agreement for Livestock as of the day and year first above written.

finding of mutual fault.

by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles

Each party recognizes that the
covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this Agreement are necessary and critical to protect
the legitimate interests of the other party, that the other party would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of

any other equitable relief (including but not limited to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief), all without

have the right to enforce such arbitral award in any court of any country which it wishes.

copy of an executed signature page of this Agreement (or of any other notice, report, request, approval or consent required or
permitted to be given under this Agreement) shall be as valid, for all purposes of contract formation and evidence and otherwise,
as delivery of an executed original. 

   14. ASSIGNMENT.

sooner than December 15, 2016,
and thereafter (b) a mutually agreed upon number of kilograms of Gold to be delivered in a single or multiple Shipments on a date
or dates for the parties  mutual convenience (with the quantities and dates of each Shipment to be agreed upon in writing
before delivery, but with the parties  current understanding being that the quantities and dates shall be consistent with
the proposed schedule set forth as Exhibit A to this Agreement). The aggregate total number of kilograms of Gold in all Shipments
combined shall not be less than 50,000, subject to the best efforts of Seller and to Seller's compliance with its obligations under
this Agreement. Any Shipments of Gold in excess of 50,000 kilograms shall be by mutual agreement between the parties. 

 Each such respective purchase
and sale of the stated quantity of the Gold is referred to in this Agreement as a  Closing,  and the Gold actually
delivered by Seller for a particular Closing is referred to in this Agreement as a  Shipment.  

 With respect to any proposed
Closing, Buyer shall have no obligation to purchase any Gold at such proposed Closing and shall have no liability of any kind for
declining to purchase Gold at such Closing, if there has been less than full satisfaction by Seller (separately as to such Closing
as distinct from any other Closings) of all of the conditions stated in this Agreement for Buyer s obligations at such particular
Closing. 

 If at  [***]  2   ,
the aggregate total of Gold in all Shipments combined is less than 50,000 kilograms through no fault of Buyer, including (but
not limited to) Buyer declining to purchase Gold at any Closing or Closings in accordance with provisions of this Agreement which
authorize Buyer to so decline, Buyer is relieved of any obligation under this Agreement to purchase any additional Gold (beyond
that which has already been purchased). Any additional sale and purchase of Gold will be by agreement of the parties.

with more particularity (by country, and mine by mine and with chain of title) by Seller in a writing delivered to Buyer at least three days before each respective Closing with respect to the Shipment delivered for such respective Closing.  The origin country(ies) will not necessarily be the same for each of the Closings.  For the first Closing, the sole country(ies) of origin will be in the Americas.   
 
       ASSAY   
      Directly before each respective Closing, Seller will deliver all the Gold for the Shipment to the Perth Mint gold refinery or a Johnson Matthey or ABC Refinery gold refinery in Australia (to be selected by Buyer in its discretion subject to approval by Seller, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld), where Buyer will cause all such Gold to be weighed and will (using one of the following two methods (to be selected by Buyer in its discretion subject to approval by Seller, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld) assay the Gold in order to determine the overall gold purity percentage of the selected Gold sample, which will then also be conclusively deemed to be the overall gold purity percentage of the entire Shipment (the  Assay ).  The two alternative methods are: (a) Buyer will select in Buyer s discretion a random sample of the Gold (of approximately 50-100 kilograms) to be refined at the refinery; or (b) Buyer will cause the entire Shipment of Gold to be smelted at the refinery and dip samples from each smelting to be taken while the Gold is molten and stirred to ensure an accurate and homologous sample is taken   all metal dip samples collected will then be tested through either ICP, AAS or Fire assay analysis to determine an accurate purity percentage of the entire Shipment.  (The Assay shall be all at Buyer s expense, regardless of the Assay method chosen.)   
 
       PACKING    
      The Gold will be delivered by Seller (to the Delivery Point) in metal containers.   

3. DELIVERY TERMS   

 a. The
Gold shall be delivered by Seller to Buyer CIF (Incoterms 2010 as amended by the terms and conditions of this Agreement) the Delivery
Point. 

 b. Seller
shall notify Buyer via email of the exact date and time Seller will deliver the Shipment to such gold refinery for the Assay process
(such email to be sent at least 48 hours in advance, unless Buyer agrees in writing to a specified Assay process time and date
which entails a shorter notice). 

   4. PRICE TERMS    

 a. The
purchase/sale price for the Gold shall be  [***]  3
   per troy ounce of Gold ( [***]  per metric ton of Gold). The
stated purchase/sale price for the Gold at each respective Closing (calculated from the weight of the Shipment to be delivered
at such Closing) is referred to in this Agreement as the  Purchase Price.  For example, the Purchase Price for a Shipment
of 10 metric tons would be  [***]  (subject to possible adjustment under Section
4.b below). Each Purchase Price is stated in and shall be paid in United States Dollars (US$). The Purchase

AS TO CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THIS DOCUMENT. EACH SUCH PORTION, WHICH HAS BEEN OMITTED HEREIN AND REPLACED WITH A SERIES OF ASTERISKS
[***], HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.  

Price shall be calculated based
on the weight of the Shipment, and shall not be adjusted for deviations in weight or purity except as expressly set forth in Section
4.b below. 

 b. The purity
of the gold in the dor  is to be at least 95.8%. If for any respective Shipment it is determined at the Assay that the indicated
gold content of the dor  is less than 95.8% or the weight of the Shipment is more than 10% lower or 5% higher than advised
by the Seller, then Buyer shall have in its sole discretion the option either to decline to accept delivery (in which case Seller
shall pursuant to Section 6 be liable to make a compensation payment to Buyer of 0.75% of the indicative Purchase Price for that
Shipment, calculated on the basis of the notice delivered by Seller under Section 5) or to accept delivery (in which case Buyer s
responsibility to pay the Purchase Price for the Shipment at the applicable Closing shall be reduced to an amount equal to the
 Adjusted Price  (defined as US$905.15 times WxP, where W = the actual gross Gold weight; and P is the actual purity
determined by  the Assay  defined in Section 2); 

and for avoidance of doubt: if for
any Shipment the Gold is of such high gross weight and/or is determined by the Assay to be of such high purity that the indicated
gold content is more than the contracted-for weight times 95.8% purity, Buyer shall nonetheless be entitled to purchase (and Seller
shall nonetheless be required to deliver and sell) the entire Shipment for the Purchase Price without any immediate or future price
adjustment). 

c. In the absence
of fraud, Seller shall not be responsible for any negative difference in weight and/or purity percentage from those determined
at the Assay. 

d. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that risk and ownership of each respective Shipment remains with Seller until the applicable Closing, and
upon the applicable Closing (i.e., upon satisfaction or express waiver in writing of all the closing conditions as set forth herein)
all title and ownership to and in the applicable Shipment Gold (i.e., including the refined gold resulting from refining the 50-100
kilogram random sample of Gold selected by Buyer, or the dip samples (as the case may be), and also including the remaining Gold
in dor  bar or other form and all other minerals contained in the dor ) shall automatically transfer to Buyer without
any requirement for further instrument of transfer on the part of Seller. 

   5. PAYMENT TERMS    

 It is not required or expected
that Buyer pay the Purchase Price directly to Seller or that the Purchase Price be paid indirectly to Seller at the exact moment
of the applicable Closing. Instead, at least 20 days before the applicable Closing (25 days, in the case of the first Closing),
Seller shall deliver to Buyer a notice in respect of the proposed Shipment detailing the anticipated weight and indicative Purchase
Price of the Shipment and its mine(s) of origin; at least 15 days before the applicable Closing (20 days, in the case of the first
Closing), Buyer shall deliver to Seller an original executed irrevocable commercial letter of credit (the  LC ) issued
by Westpac or another commercial bank in Australia or the United States of equivalent stature and financial strength (the  Issuing
Bank ) and in an amount equal to or greater than the indicative Purchase Price for the applicable Closing. Such LC shall provide
that, upon presentation by Seller to the Issuing Bank of the documentary requirements set forth in such LC (the  Satisfaction
Documents ), the Issuing Bank shall satisfy the full applicable Purchase Price payment obligation to Seller under the LC. 

 In the case of a LC for a Closing
other than the first Closing, such LC shall provide that, upon presentation by Seller to the Issuing Bank from time to time of
the documentary requirements set forth as such applicable other LC s Satisfaction Documents (which shall be of like tenor
as the Satisfaction Documents in the first LC except for the changes in dates and amounts), the 

Issuing Bank shall satisfy
the full applicable Purchase Price payment obligation to Seller under the applicable other LC. 

 Unless Seller provides Buyer
with different wire transfer instructions by written notice to Buyer before the issuance of the applicable LC, the applicable LC
shall provide that upon presentation by Seller to the Issuing Bank of the applicable Satisfaction Documents, the Issuing Bank shall
wire the purchase price as follows: 

6. CLOSING.   

   Obligation of Buyer for
Delivery of Satisfaction Documents  . At each respective Closing, Buyer shall (if the conditions to the closing obligations
of Buyer as set forth below shall have been satisfied at or before such Closing) deliver to Seller the applicable Satisfaction
Documents for such Closing. 

   Refinery Test Leading
to Closing  . Immediately after Seller s delivery of the respective Shipment of Gold to the gold refinery selected
by Buyer, Buyer shall cause the Assay to be performed, and the true purity of the Gold (as Delivered) shall thereby be conclusively
deemed to have been determined as to the entire Shipment. The time for the applicable Closing shall be 24 hours after Buyer has
received the results of the Assay, and Seller shall be deemed to have delivered at such Closing the entire applicable Shipment
of Gold (i.e., including the pure refined gold resulting from refining the 50-100 kilogram sample, or the dip samples (as the case
may be), and also including the remaining Gold in dor  bar or other form and all other minerals contained in the dor ). 

 If a Section 4.b Adjusted Price
is indicated, it shall be applied and shall be determined solely and conclusively based upon the true purity as determined by the
Assay and upon the gross Shipment weight as determined by the refinery. 

   Default in Shipment .
  If a notice is delivered by Seller under Section 5 but the proposed Shipment referred to in the notice does not occur, whether
due to Seller's suppliers of Gold defaulting on their obligations to deliver the indicated amount of Gold for that proposed shipment,
or otherwise, Seller must make a compensation payment to Buyer of 0.75% of the indicative Purchase Price for that Shipment, calculated
on the basis of the notice delivered by Seller under Section 5. 

   Conditions to Closing Obligations
of Buyer  . Buyer s obligations at each respective applicable Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction (or express
waiver in writing by Buyer)

an election whether or not to accept delivery of the Gold in the applicable Shipment. (If Buyer has such an election but does not
expressly notify Seller before the applicable Closing that Buyer has elected not to accept delivery of the Gold in the applicable
Shipment, then it shall be conclusively deemed that Buyer has waived such right to decline such Shipment and has elected to accept
delivery of the Gold in the applicable Shipment, and the Purchase price payable for such Shipment shall be reduced to the Adjusted
Price.)

confirm that a separate and completely compliant (for legal purposes and to comply with the compliance requirements of the Issuing
Bank and the relevant refinery) set of Delivery Documents (and a separate performance of each of the other closing conditions stated
above, in addition to the Delivery Documents) is required for each separate Closing; without a separate and completely compliant
set of Delivery Documents (and a separate performance of each of the other closing conditions stated above, in addition to the

such applicable separate Closing and Buyer shall have no obligation to proceed with the purchase of any Gold at such Closing and
shall have no liability of any kind for declining to proceed with the purchase of any Gold at such Closing. 

   Conditions to Closing Obligations

shall have at least 15 days before such Closing (20 days, in the case of the first Closing) delivered to Seller an original executed
LC for an amount equal to or greater than the applicable indicative Purchase Price (as contemplated by and in accordance with Section
5 of this Agreement). 

 e. Buyer
shall have delivered the Satisfaction Documents to Seller at the Closing. 

   Sequencing  . It
is expressly understood, agreed and expected that the applicable Closing might be completed before Seller has had an opportunity

nonetheless upon the applicable Closing (i.e., upon satisfaction or express waiver in writing of all the closing conditions as
set forth herein) all title and ownership to and in the applicable Shipment Gold (i.e., including the refined gold resulting from
refining the 50-100 kilogram sample of Gold selected by Buyer, or the dip samples (as the case may be), and also including the

notice, report, request, approval or consent required or permitted to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall
be deemed to have been sufficiently given if delivered in person to  [***]    5
   at the address noted at the beginning of this Agreement (if to Buyer) or to 8600
Transit Road, East Amherst, New York 14051, USA, attention: Darin Pastor, Chief Executive Officer (if to Seller) or if emailed
to [***] (if to Buyer) or to dpastor@capstonefg.com (if to Seller). Either party may change its address or email address for all
future notices, reports, requests, approvals and consents by giving, pursuant to this Section 8, written notice of such change

   9. FORCE MAJEURE    

 Neither party shall be liable
for failure to perform, or delay in the performance of, its obligations under this Agreement when such failure or delay is caused
by an event of force majeure. For purposes of this Agreement, an event of force majeure means any event or circumstance beyond
the reasonable control of the affected party and not reasonably preventable using industry standard practices, including but not
limited to, war, insurrection, act of terrorism, riot, fire, flood or other unusual weather condition, explosion, act of God, peril
of the sea, sabotage, accident, embargo, act of governmental authority, compliance with governmental order on national defense
requirements, or inability due to general industry wide shortages to obtain fuel, power, raw materials, labor or transportation
facilities. The source country s governmental acts or orders shall not constitute force majeure as to Seller s obligations.
If, due to any event of force majeure, either party shall be unable to fulfill its obligations under this Agreement, the affected
party shall immediately notify the other party of such inability and of the period during which such inability is expected to continue,
shall use reasonable commercial efforts to cure and remedy such non-performance (including, for example, by substituting other
acceptable Gold for the sourced Gold which is subject to force majeure) and the time for performance shall be extended for a number
of days equal to the duration of the force majeure, and the parties shall meet promptly to determine an equitable solution to the
effects of such event. If such force majeure has continued for at least six months and the affected party has, despite use of reasonable
commercial efforts, been unable to cure and remedy such non-performance, either party may terminate this Agreement by written notice
to the other. 

   10. ETHICS: (NON-CIRCUMVENTION
and NON-DISCLOSURE).    

 Both Buyer and Seller acknowledge
that they are subject to the terms of the Non-Disclosure/Non-Use/Non-Circumvention Agreements dated August 2, 2016 and August 25,
2016 between Buyer and Seller. It is expressly agreed that Seller may, in its discretion, disclose this Agreement to prospective
suppliers of Seller, in order to induce them to enter into and/or proceed with the supply transaction with Seller. 

   11. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.    

 This Agreement is the entire
agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous negotiations,
understandings,

   CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED
AS TO CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THIS DOCUMENT. EACH SUCH PORTION, WHICH HAS BEEN OMITTED HEREIN AND REPLACED WITH A SERIES OF ASTERISKS

commitments and agreements (whether
oral or in writing) with regard to the subject matter hereof. No waivers, changes, alterations or substitutions shall be permitted
unless the same shall be notified in writing and signed by both parties. The English language version of this Agreement shall be
controlling over any version in any other language. 

   12. SEVERABILITY.   

 This Agreement is severable.
When possible, each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
law; but if any provision of this Agreement is determined by a final and binding court or arbitration judgment to be invalid, illegal
or unenforceable to any extent, such provision shall not be affected or impaired up to the limits of such invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability; the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected
or impaired in any way; and the parties agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such invalid, illegal and unenforceable provision
(or portion of provision) with a valid, legal and enforceable provision that achieves, to the greatest lawful extent under this
Agreement, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or portion of provision). 

   13. APPLICABLE LAW AND
BINDING ARBITRATION.    

 Any and all disputes or controversies
arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be exclusively and finally resolved by binding arbitration (using the English
language) in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the International Chamber of Commerce then in effect, in New York
City, USA. The arbitration proceedings shall be conducted promptly and in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the
International Chamber of Commerce then in effect. The expenses of any arbitration, including the reasonable attorney fees of the
prevailing party, shall be borne by the party deemed to be at fault or on a pro-rata basis should the arbitration conclude in a
finding of mutual fault. 

 This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, USA (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles
that require the application of the law of a different state or country). The parties agree that the United Nations Convention
on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall be inapplicable to this Agreement and transactions hereunder and thereunder. 

 Each party recognizes that the
covenants and agreements herein and their continued performance as set forth in this Agreement are necessary and critical to protect
the legitimate interests of the other party, that the other party would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence of
such covenants and agreements and the assurance of continued performance as set forth in this Agreement, and that a party s
breach or threatened breach of such covenants and agreements may cause the other party irreparable harm and significant injury,
the amount of which will be extremely difficult to estimate and ascertain, thus potentially making any remedy at law or in damages
inadequate. Therefore, each party confirms and agrees that the other party shall be entitled to seek on an interim or permanent
basis specific performance, an order restraining any breach or threatened breach of any or all provisions of this Agreement, and
any other equitable relief (including but not limited to temporary, preliminary and/or permanent injunctive relief), all without
need to post any bond or security, and in addition to and not exclusive of any other remedy available to such other party at law
or in equity. 

 Neither party shall commence
any court proceeding or action against the other to resolve any dispute, except to enforce an arbitral award rendered pursuant
to this Section. For all purposes 

of this Agreement, the parties
hereby submit to the jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in New York City, USA. In addition, the party in whose
favor an arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Section was granted shall have the right to enforce such arbitral award in any
court of any country which it wishes. 

   14. ELECTRONIC COPIES;
COUNTERPARTS.   

 This Agreement may be executed
and delivered in counterparts (portable document format (.pdf)/electronic transmission included), each of which shall constitute
an original document, but both of which shall constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of a portable document format (.pdf)
copy of an executed signature page of this Agreement (or of any other notice, report, request, approval or consent required or
permitted to be given under this Agreement) shall be as valid, for all purposes of contract formation and evidence and otherwise,
as delivery of an executed original. 

   15. ASSIGNMENT.   

 Either party may assign its rights
under this Agreement. Either party may assign its duties, liabilities and/or obligations under this Agreement, but the effect of
doing so is that the assignee will become responsible for such duties, liabilities and/or obligations and the assignor will remain
jointly and severally responsible for such duties, liabilities and/or obligations. 

   16. FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES.   

 Each party is responsible for
its own fees, costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement. 

   17. FURTHER ASSURANCES.   

 The parties hereby covenant and
agree to reasonably cooperate and assist to, without the necessity of any further consideration, execute, acknowledge and deliver
any and all such other documents and instruments and take any such other action as may be reasonably necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate, make effective, comply with and carry out the intent and purposes of this Agreement. Each party shall reasonably
assist and facilitate to aid the other party s compliance, and evidence of compliance, with all applicable governmental,
refinery and/or bank requirements and regulations. 

   18. RELATIONSHIP OF PARTIES.

Each of the parties hereto is
an independent contractor and nothing in this Agreement is intended or shall be deemed to constitute a partnership, agency, employer-employee
or joint venture relationship between the parties. Neither party shall have the right to, and each party agrees not to purport
to, incur any debts, liabilities or obligation for which the other is or will be responsible, or make any commitments or contracts
for the other. Each party represents and warrants that it has not incurred any debts, liabilities or obligations for which the
other is or will be responsible, or made any commitments or contracts for the other. 

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have
set their hands to this Sale and Purchase Agreement for Gold as of the day and year first above written.
