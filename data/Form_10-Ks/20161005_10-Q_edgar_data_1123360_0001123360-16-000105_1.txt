NOTE   1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Business, consolidation and presentation    We are a leading worldwide provider of payment technology services delivering innovative solutions to our customers globally. Our technologies, partnerships and employee expertise enable us to provide a broad range of services that allow our customers to accept various payment types. We distribute our services across a variety of channels to merchants and partners in   30   countries throughout North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and in Brazil and operate in   three   reportable segments: North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.  
     
  We were incorporated in Georgia as Global Payments Inc. in   2000   and spun-off from our former parent company in   2001  .  Including our time as part of our former parent company, we have been in the payment technology services business since   1967  . Global Payments Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries are referred to collectively as "Global Payments," the "Company," "we," "our" or "us," unless the context requires otherwise. 
    
  These unaudited consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our majority-owned subsidiaries, and all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. These unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). The consolidated balance sheet as of   May 31, 2016   was derived from the audited financial statements for the year ended   May 31, 2016   included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   May 31, 2016   but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP for annual financial statements. 
    
  In the opinion of our management, all known adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods have been made.  These adjustments consist of normal recurring accruals and estimates that affect the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.  These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   May 31, 2016  . 
    
  On July 27, 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a change in our fiscal year-end from May 31 to December 31. As a result of the change, we will file a Transition Report on Form 10-K for the seven-month transition period ending December 31, 2016 (the "Transition Period"). During the Transition Period, we will continue to file Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q based on our prior year-end. 
    
  Use of estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period.  Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.  
    
  Stock split    Our board of directors declared a   two  -for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend of one additional share of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock (the "Stock Split"), and the stock dividend was paid on   November 2, 2015   to all shareholders of record as of   October 21, 2015  . Common share and per share data for prior periods in the consolidated financial statements and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect the Stock Split, except for authorized common shares, which were not affected. 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-05, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40):   Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  ." The amendments in this update provide guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance does not change GAAP for a customer s accounting for service contracts. We adopted this standard as of June 1, 2016 on a prospective basis, and it was not material to our balance sheet and/or our results of operations or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ," which makes clarifications to how cash receipts and cash payments in certain transactions are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods, and will require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which case we would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements and disclosures.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial instruments  ." The amendments in this update change how companies measure and recognize credit impairment for many financial assets. The new expected credit loss model will require companies to immediately recognize an estimate of credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of the financial assets (including trade receivables) that are in the scope of the update. The update also made amendments to the current impairment model for held-to-maturity and available-for-sale debt securities and certain guarantees. The guidance will be effective for years beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods in years beginning after December 15, 2018. We are evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  " The amendments in this update will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. Entities will be required to recognize the income tax effects of awards in the statement of income when the awards vest or are settled.  This update also changes the guidance on employers  accounting for an employee s use of shares to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation, and permits entities to elect to recognize forfeitures based on actuals or estimates.  Finally, the update eliminates the hypothetical additional paid-in capital pool, permits stock option deductions even if not realized in the current year on a return, requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity and potentially has a dilutive effect on earnings per share ("EPS") to the extent that excess tax benefits have historically been included in the calculation of diluted EPS.  The amendments in this update will be effective for years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "  Leases  ." The amendments in this update require lessees to recognize, on the balance sheet, assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leases. Accounting by lessors will remain largely unchanged. The guidance will be effective for years, including interim periods, beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition where the lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. We are evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10):   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ." The amendments in this update address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments in this update supersede the guidance to classify equity securities with readily determinable fair values into different categories (that is, trading or available-for-sale) and require equity securities (including other ownership interests, such as partnerships, unincorporated joint ventures and limited liability companies) to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through earnings. Equity investments that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting or result in consolidation of an investee are not included within the scope of this update. The amendments allow equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values to be remeasured at fair value either upon the occurrence of an observable price change or upon identification of an impairment. The amendments also require enhanced disclosures about those investments. The guidance will be effective for years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. Except for specific aspects of this pronouncement, early adoption of the amendments in this update is not permitted. We are evaluating the effect of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)." The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

The update requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):   Deferral of the Effective Date  ," is effective for years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted for years beginning after December 15, 2016. We are evaluating the effect of ASU 2014-09, as well as other clarifications and technical guidance issued by the FASB related to this new revenue standard, on our consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE   2   ACQUISITIONS 
    
  Heartland 
    
  On December 15, 2015, we entered into a merger agreement with Heartland, pursuant to which we merged with Heartland in a cash-and-stock transaction that we completed on April 22, 2016 for total purchase consideration of   $3.9 billion  . 
    
  This transaction was accounted for as a business combination, which requires that we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at fair value as of the acquisition date. The initial accounting for these acquisitions was not complete as of August 31, 2016. The fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed have been determined provisionally and are subject to adjustment as we obtain additional information. There were no material measurement-period adjustments during the three months ended   August 31, 2016  . Additional time is needed to refine and review the results of the valuation of assets and liabilities and to evaluate the basis differences for assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes. Also, we are still in the process of assigning goodwill to our reporting units.  
    
  The provisional estimated acquisition-date fair values of major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including a reconciliation to the total purchase consideration, are as follows (in thousands): 

FIS Gaming Business 
    
  On   June 1, 2015  , we acquired certain assets of Certegy Check Services, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of     Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. ("FIS"). Under the purchase agreement, we acquired substantially all of the assets of its gaming business related to licensed gaming operators (the "FIS Gaming Business"), including approximately   260   gaming client locations, for   $237.5 million  , funded from borrowings on our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. We acquired the FIS Gaming Business to expand our direct distribution and service offerings in the gaming industry. This transaction was accounted for as a business combination. We recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Transaction costs associated with this business combination were not material. The revenue and earnings of the FIS Gaming Business for the year ended   May 31, 2016   were not material nor were the historical revenue and earnings of the acquired business material for the purpose of presenting pro forma information.

The estimated acquisition-date fair values of major classes of assets acquired and liabilities assumed including a reconciliation to the total purchase consideration, are as follows (in thousands): 

Goodwill arising from the acquisition, included in the North America segment, was attributable to expected growth opportunities, including cross-selling opportunities at existing and acquired gaming client locations, operating synergies in the gaming business and assembled workforce. Goodwill associated with this acquisition is deductible for income tax purposes. The customer-related intangible assets have an estimated amortization period of   15   years. 

NOTE   3   SETTLEMENT PROCESSING ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS 
    
  As of   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , settlement processing assets and obligations consisted of the following:

NOTE 4 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  As of   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , goodwill and other intangible assets consisted of the following:     

The following table sets forth the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  : 

There was   no   accumulated impairment loss as of   August 31, 2016   or   May 31, 2016  . 

NOTE   5   OTHER ASSETS 
    
  Through certain of our subsidiaries in Europe, we were a member and shareholder of Visa Europe Limited ("Visa Europe"). On   June 21, 2016  , Visa Inc. ("Visa") acquired all of the membership interests in Visa Europe, including ours, upon which we recorded a gain of   $41.2 million   included in interest and other income in our consolidated statement of income for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  . We received up-front consideration comprised of    33.5 million   (  $37.7 million   equivalent at   June 21, 2016  ) in cash and Series B and C convertible preferred shares whose initial conversion rate equates to Visa common shares valued at   $22.9 million   as of   June 21, 2016  . However, the preferred shares, which we account for using the cost method, have been assigned a value of   zero   as of   June 21, 2016  , based on transfer restrictions, Visa's ability to adjust the conversion rate, and the estimation uncertainty associated with those factors. The fair value was determined using inputs classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy due to the absence of quoted market prices, lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management s judgment. The preferred shares will convert into Visa common shares at periodic intervals over a   12  -year period. Based on the outcome of potential litigation involving Visa Europe in the United Kingdom and elsewhere  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

in Europe, the conversion rate of the preferred shares could be adjusted down such that the number of Visa common shares ultimately received could be as low as   zero  , and approximately    25.6 million   (  $28.8 million   equivalent at   June 21, 2016  ) of the up-front cash consideration could be refundable. On the third anniversary of the closing of the acquisition by Visa, we will also receive    3.1 million   (  $3.5 million   at   June 21, 2016  ) of deferred consideration (plus compounded interest at a rate of   4.0%   per annum). 

NOTE   6   LONG-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES 
    
  As of   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , long-term debt consisted of the following: 

Maturity requirements on long-term debt as of   August 31, 2016   are as follows (in thousands): 

July 2015 Refinancing 
    
  On   July 31, 2015  , we entered into a second amended and restated term loan agreement (the "2015 Term Loan Agreement") and a second amended and restated credit agreement (the "2015 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement" and collectively, the "2015 Credit Facility Agreements") to provide for a   $1.75 billion   term loan (the "Term A Loan") and a   $1.25 billion   revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), each with a syndicate of financial institutions. We used the proceeds of approximately   $2.0 billion   to repay the then-outstanding balances on our previously existing term loan and revolving credit facility.  
    
  February 2016 Refinancing 
    
  On   February 26, 2016  , we entered into an amendment to the 2015 Credit Facility Agreements (as amended, the "2016 Credit Facility Agreement") to, among other things, (i) accelerate our repayment schedule for the Term A Loan, effective as of   February 26, 2016  , and (ii) provide security for the Term A Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility and modify the applicable financial covenants and interest rate margins. In addition, the 2016 Credit Facility Agreement provided for a new   $735 million   delayed draw term loan facility (the "Delayed Draw Facility"). 
    
  We also entered into a new     $1.045 billion   term B loan ("Term B Loan"). The Delayed Draw Facility and Term B Loan were issued on April 22, 2016 in connection with our merger with Heartland, resulting in total financing of approximately   $4.78 billion  . The incremental proceeds from the new loans were used, among other things, to repay certain portions of Heartland's existing  
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

indebtedness and to finance, in part, the cash consideration and the merger-related costs. Substantially all of the assets of our domestic subsidiaries are pledged as collateral under the 2016 Credit Facility Agreement. 
    
  The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement provides for an interest rate, at our election, of either London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") or a base rate, in each case plus a leverage-based margin. As of   August 31, 2016  , the interest rates on the Term A Loan, the Term B Loan and the Delayed Draw Facility were   3.02%  ,   4.02%   and   2.94%  , respectively.  
    
  Pursuant to the 2016 Credit Facility Agreement, the Term A Loan must be repaid in equal quarterly installments of   $43.8 million   commencing in November 2016 and ending in May 2020, with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in July 2020. The Delayed Draw Facility must be repaid in quarterly installments of   $1.7 million  , the first installment of which was made in August 2016, increasing to quarterly installments of   $8.6 million   in August 2018 and ending in May 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity in July 2020. The Term B Loan must be repaid in quarterly installments of   $2.6 million  , the first installment of which was made in September 2016, ending in March 2023, with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in April 2023.  
    
  As of   August 31, 2016  , the outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was   $992.5 million  . The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement allows us to issue standby letters of credit of up to   $100 million   in the aggregate under the Revolving Credit Facility. Outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. Borrowings available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility are further limited by the covenants described below under "Compliance with Covenants." At   August 31, 2016   and May 31, 2016, we had outstanding standby letters of credit of   $21.3 million   and   $8.5 million  , respectively. The total available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at   August 31, 2016   and May 31, 2016 were   $236.2 million   and   $204.5 million  , respectively. As of   August 31, 2016  , the interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility was   2.94%  .  In addition, w  e are required to pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in July 2020. 
    
  The 2015 Credit Facility Agreement and the 2016 Credit Facility Agreement were combined in evaluating the accounting treatment for fees and expenses incurred. We incurred fees and expenses associated with the 2015 Credit Facility Agreement and the 2016 Credit Facility Agreement of approximately   $63.4 million  . The portion of the debt issuance costs related to the Revolving Credit Facility is included in other noncurrent assets, and the portion of the debt issuance costs related to the Term A Loan, the Term B Loan and the Delayed Draw Facility is reported as a reduction to the carrying amount of the debt. Debt issuance costs are amortized as an adjustment to interest expense over the terms of the respective facilities. 
    
  Settlement Lines of Credit 
    
  We have lines of credit with banks in various markets where we do business. The lines of credit, which are restricted for use in funding settlement, generally have variable interest rates and are subject to annual review. The credit facilities are generally denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. For certain of our lines of credit, the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender.  Accordingly, the amount of the outstanding line of credit may exceed the stated credit limit. As of   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , a total of   $46.6 million   and   $42.9 million  , respectively, of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit. 
    
  As of   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , respectively, we had   $332.1 million   and   $378.4 million   outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity of   $744.3 million   as of   August 31, 2016   to fund settlement. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was   1.98%   and   1.80%   at   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , respectively.  
    
  During the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , the maximum and average outstanding balances under these lines of credit were   $550.1 million   and   $311.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  Compliance with Covenants 
    
  The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. Financial covenants require a leverage ratio no greater than (i)   5.00   to   1.00   as of the end of any fiscal quarter ended during the period from April 22, 2016 through August 31, 2016, (ii)   4.75   to   1.00   as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period from September 1, 2016 through February 28, 2017, (iii)

4.50    to   1.00   as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period from March 1, 2017 through August 31, 2017, (iv)   4.25    to   1.00   as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending during the period from September 1, 2017 to February 28, 2018 and (v)   4.00    to   1.00   as of the end of any fiscal quarter ending thereafter. The fixed charge coverage ratio is required to be no less than   2.25   to   1.00  . The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement and settlement lines of credit also include various other covenants that are customary in such borrowings. The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement includes covenants, subject in each case to exceptions and qualifications, that may restrict certain payments, including, in certain circumstances, the payment of cash dividends in excess of our current rate of   $0.01   per share per quarter. 
    
  The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement also includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable cure period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations to be immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of and for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  . 
    
  Interest Rate Swap Agreements 
    
  We have interest rate swap agreements with financial institutions to hedge changes in cash flows attributable to interest rate risk on a portion of our variable-rate debt instruments. A   $500 million   notional interest rate swap agreement, which became effective on   October 31, 2014  , effectively converted   $500 million   of our variable-rate debt to a fixed rate of   1.52%   plus a leverage-based margin and will mature on   February 28, 2019  . A   $250 million   notional interest rate swap, which became effective on   August 28, 2015  , effectively converted   $250 million   of our variable-rate debt to a fixed rate of   1.34%   plus a leverage-based margin and will mature on   July 31, 2020  .  
    
  Net amounts to be received or paid under the swap agreements are reflected as adjustments to interest expense. Since we have designated the interest rate swap agreements as portfolio cash flow hedges, unrealized gains or losses resulting from adjusting the swaps to fair value are recorded as components of other comprehensive income, except for any ineffective portion of the change in fair value, which would be immediately recorded in interest expense. During the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  , there was no ineffectiveness. The fair values of the interest rate swaps were determined based on the present value of the estimated future net cash flows using implied rates in the applicable yield curve as of the valuation date. These derivative instruments were classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. 
    
  The table below presents the fair values of our derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges included within accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets:

The table below presents the effects of our interest rate swaps on the consolidated statements of income and other comprehensive loss for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015  : 

At   August 31, 2016  , the amount in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to our interest rate swaps that is expected to be reclassified into interest expense during the next 12 months was approximately   $5.9 million  . 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense was approximately   $43 million   and   $13 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   

NOTE 7 INCOME TAX 
    
  Our effective income tax rates were   23.3%   and   26.0%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively. Our effective income tax rates differ from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to income generated in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 
    
  We conduct business globally and file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions.  In the normal course of business, we are subject to examination by taxing authorities around the world, including, without limitation, the United States and the United Kingdom. We are no longer subject to state income tax examinations for years ended on or before   May 31, 2008  , U.S. federal income tax examinations for fiscal years prior to   2013   and U.K. federal income tax examinations for years ended on or before   May 31, 2013  . 

NOTE 8 SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY 
    
  From time-to-time, we make repurchases of our common stock mainly through the use of open market purchases and accelerated share repurchase programs ("ASR's"). As of   August 31, 2016  , we were authorized to repurchase up to   $199.3 million   of our common stock. 
    
  During the three months ended   August 31, 2016  ,   127,435   shares were delivered to us in connection with the completion of an ASR initiated on April 25, 2016. In addition, through open market repurchase plans, we repurchased and retired   960,716   shares of our common stock at a cost of   $67.6 million  , or an average cost of   $70.39   per share, including commissions. 
    
  During the three months ended August 31, 2015,   324,742   shares were delivered to us in connection with the completion of an ASR initiated on   April 10, 2015  . In addition to the ASR, through open market repurchase plans, we repurchased and retired   694,990   shares of our common stock at a cost of   $37.9 million  , or an average cost of $  54.56   per share, including commissions.

NOTE 9 SHARE-BASED AWARDS AND OPTIONS 
    
  The following table summarizes share-based compensation expense and the related income tax benefit recognized for our share-based awards and stock options:  

Share-Based Awards 
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in unvested share-based awards for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  : 

The total fair value of share-based awards vested during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015   was   $20.9 million   and   $15.7 million  , respectively.   
    
  For these share-based awards, we recognized compensation expense of   $7.0 million   and   $6.1 million   during the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively. As of   August 31, 2016  , there was $  56.6 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested share-based awards that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of   2.3   years. Our share-based award plans provide for accelerated vesting under certain conditions. 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  Stock options are granted with an exercise price equal to   100%   of fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and have a term of   ten   years.  Stock options granted before fiscal 2015 vest in equal installments on each of the first   four   anniversaries of the grant date. Stock options granted during fiscal 2015 and thereafter vest in equal installments on each of the first   three   anniversaries of the grant date. During the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , we granted   72,733   and   72,393   stock options, respectively. Our stock option plans provide for accelerated vesting under certain conditions. 

18 

     Table of Contents  

The following summarizes changes in unvested stock option activity for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  :    

We recognized compensation expense for stock options of   $0.4 million   and   $0.2 million   during the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015   was   $6.1 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively.  As of   August 31, 2016  , we had   $3.7 million   of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options that we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of   2.1   years. 
    
  The weighted-average grant-date fair value of each stock option granted during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015   was   $21.87   and   $15.60  , respectively. Fair value was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model with the following weighted-average assumptions: 

The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a zero coupon U.S. Treasury security with a maturity equal to the expected life of the option from the date of the grant. Our assumption on expected volatility is based on our historical volatility. The dividend yield assumption is calculated using our average stock price over the preceding year and the annualized amount of our most current quarterly dividend per share. We based our assumptions on the expected term of the options on our analysis of the historical exercise patterns of the options and our assumption on the future exercise pattern of options. 

NOTE 10 EARNINGS PER SHARE 
    
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing reported net income attributable to Global Payments by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period. Earnings available to common shareholders is the same as reported net income attributable to Global Payments for all periods presented.  
    
  Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Global Payments by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period, including the effect of share-based awards that would have a dilutive effect on earnings per share. All stock options with an exercise price lower than the average market share price of our common stock for the period are assumed to have a dilutive effect on earnings per share. There were   no   stock options that would have an antidilutive effect on the computation of diluted earnings per share for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  . The diluted share base for the three months ended   August 31, 2015   excludes less than   0.1 million   shares related to stock options that would have an antidilutive effect on earnings per share.

The following table sets forth the computation of diluted weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  : 

NOTE 11 ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS 
    
  The changes in the accumulated balances for each component of other comprehensive loss were as follows for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  :  

Other comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interest, which relates only to foreign currency translation, was approximately   zero   and $  1.9 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively. 

NOTE 12 SEGMENT INFORMATION  
    
  We evaluate performance and allocate resources based on the operating income of each operating segment.  The operating income of each operating segment includes the revenues of the segment less expenses that are directly related to those revenues.  Operating overhead, shared costs and certain compensation costs are included in Corporate in the following table.  Interest and other income, interest and other expense and provision for income taxes are not allocated to the individual operating segments.  We do not evaluate the performance of or allocate resources to our operating segments using asset data.  The accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   May 31, 2016   and our summary of significant accounting policies in "Note   1  -Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies."

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Quarterly Report and the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and consolidated financial statements contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   May 31, 2016  . This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future. Forward-looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward-looking statements. See "Forward-Looking Statements" below for additional information.  
    
  On September 29, 2015, our board of directors declared a   two  -for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend of one additional share of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock (the  Stock Split ), which was paid on   November 2, 2015  . As a result, all share and per share information presented herein for prior periods has been adjusted for the Stock Split. 
    
  Executive Overview 
    
  We are a leading worldwide provider of payment technology services delivering innovative solutions to our customers globally. Our technologies, partnerships and employee expertise enable us to provide a broad range of services that allow our customers to accept various payment types. We distribute our services across a variety of channels to merchants and partners in   30   countries throughout North America, Europe, the Asia-Pacific region and Brazil and operate in three reportable segments: North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific.  
    
  On December 15, 2015, we entered into a merger agreement with Heartland, pursuant to which we merged with Heartland in a cash-and-stock transaction that we completed on April 22, 2016 for total purchase consideration of   $3.9 billion  . See "Note   2   Acquisitions" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our merger with Heartland. 
    
  Highlights related to our financial condition and results of operations for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   are provided below: 

Consolidated revenues increased by   25.5%   to   $939.5 million   in the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to   $748.8 million   for the prior-year period primarily due to the inclusion of Heartland, partially offset by the unfavorable effect of currency fluctuations in foreign markets of   $14.4 million  . 

Consolidated operating income was   $121.1 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to   $137.8 million   for the prior-year period, and our operating margin was   12.9%   compared to   18.4%   for the prior-year period. The contribution of the revenue growth in local currency was more than offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of   $64.4 million   and Heartland integration expenses of   $30.5 million   for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  . 

On   June 21, 2016  , Visa Inc. ("Visa") acquired all of the membership interests in Visa Europe Limited ("Visa Europe"), including ours, and we recorded a gain on the sale of those investments of   $41.2 million  . 

Net income attributable to Global Payments was   $85.1 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to   $86.6 million   in the prior-year period. Diluted earnings per share was   $0.55   compared to   $0.66   in the prior-year period.

Results of Operations 
    
  The following table sets forth key selected financial data for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , this data as a percentage of total revenues, and the changes between the periods in dollars and as a percentage of the prior year amount. 

(1)   Percentage amounts may not sum to the total due to rounding. 
    
  Revenues 
    
  For the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , revenues increased by   25.5%   compared to the prior year to   $939.5 million  , despite the unfavorable effect of currency fluctuations of   $14.4 million  .  
    
  North America Segment  . For the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , revenues from our North America segment increased by   $180.9 million  , or   34.1%  , compared to the prior year to   $711.8 million  , primarily due to the merger with Heartland. 
    
  Europe Segment.   For the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , Europe revenues increased   $1.2 million  , or   0.7%  , compared to the prior year to   $169.6 million  . The increase was primarily due to revenues associated with a joint venture with Erste Group Bank AG ("Erste Group") in Central and Eastern Europe. 
    
  Asia-Pacific Segment.   For the three months ended   August 31, 2016  , Asia-Pacific revenues increased by   $8.6 million  , or   17.3%  , compared to the prior year to   $58.2 million  , primarily due to revenues associated with recent acquisitions.

Operating Expenses 
    
  Cost of Service.   Cost of service increased by   69.7%   to   $462.6 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the prior year. As a percentage of revenue, cost of service increased to   49.2%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   from   36.4%   for the prior year. The increase in cost of service was driven primarily by an increase in the variable costs associated with our revenue growth, including those related to our merger with Heartland, and by additional intangible asset amortization of   $59.7 million   associated with recently acquired businesses.  
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by   5.1%   to   $355.8 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the prior year.  As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to   37.9%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   from   45.2%   for the prior year. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily due to additional costs to support the growth of our business, including incremental expenses associated with the integration of Heartland. 
    
  Operating Income and Operating Margin for Segments 
    
  North America Segment  . Operating income in our North America segment increased by   26.6%   to   $105.7 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the prior year.  Operating margin decreased   0.8   percentage points for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  . The increase in operating income was primarily due to revenue growth in our U.S. business offset by expenses associated with the merger with Heartland, including intangible asset amortization. 
    
  Europe Segment  . Operating income in our Europe segment decreased by   9.9%   to   $65.5 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the prior year, including the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations of   $7.1 million  . The operating margin was   38.7%   and   43.2%   for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by the effect of unfavorable currency fluctuations. The decrease in operating margin was primarily associated with the integration of our new joint venture with Erste Group. 
    
  Asia-Pacific Segment  . Operating income in our Asia-Pacific segment increased by   14.6%   to   $14.0 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the prior year. The operating margin was   24.1%   and   24.7%   for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The increase in operating income was due to revenue growth. 
    
  Corporate.   Corporate expenses increased by   108.9%   to   $64.2 million   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   compared to the prior year, primarily due to the merger with Heartland and expenses of   $30.5 million   associated with integration. 
    
  Other Income/Expense, Net 
    
  Interest and other income increased primarily due to a gain of   $41.2 million   recorded   in connection with the sale of our membership interests in Visa Europe  . See "Note   5   Other Assets" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction. 
    
  Interest and other expense increased   $29.8 million   due primarily to an increase in interest expense resulting from an increase in borrowings under our recently expanded credit facilities to fund the merger with Heartland. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes  
    
  Our effective income tax rates were   23.3%   and   26.0%   for the three months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in our effective income tax rates for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   is primarily due to income generated in international jurisdictions with lower tax rates. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   
    
  In the ordinary course of our business, a significant portion of our liquidity comes from operating cash flows. Cash flow from operations is used to make planned capital investments in our business, to pursue acquisitions that meet our corporate objectives, to  
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

pay dividends and to pay down debt and repurchase shares of our common stock.  Accumulated cash balances are invested in high-quality, marketable short-term instruments. 
    
  Our capital plan objectives are to support our operational needs and strategic plan for long-term growth while maintaining a low cost of capital. We use debt financing, such as our revolving credit facility and our term loans, for general corporate purposes and to fund acquisitions. In addition, specialized lines of credit are also used in certain of our markets to pre-fund settlement. We regularly evaluate our liquidity and capital position relative to cash requirements, and we may elect to raise additional funds in the future, either through the issuance of debt, equity or otherwise. 
    
  At   August 31, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents totaling   $977.8 million  . Of this amount, we consider   $355.2 million   to be available cash. Available cash excludes (1) settlement-related cash reserve balances, (2) funds held for collateral for merchant losses ("Merchant Reserves") and (3) funds held for customers. Settlement-related cash reserve balances represent funds that we hold when the incoming amount from the card networks precedes the funding obligation to the merchant. Settlement-related cash reserve balances are not restricted; however, these funds are generally paid out in satisfaction of settlement processing obligations the following day. At   August 31, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents included   $433.7 million   for settlement-related cash reserve balances. Certain of our funds collected from our merchants serve as collateral to minimize contingent liabilities associated with any losses that may occur under the merchant agreement. At   August 31, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents included   $160.2 million   related to Merchant Reserves. While this cash is not restricted in its use, we believe that designating this cash to collateralize Merchant Reserves strengthens our fiduciary standing with our member sponsors and is in accordance with the guidelines set by the card networks. Funds held for customers and the corresponding liability that we record in customer deposits include amounts collected prior to remittance on our customers' behalf. At   August 31, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents included funds held for customers of   $201.4 million  . 
    
  Our available cash balance includes   $223.3 million   of cash held by foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. These cash balances reflect our capital investments in these subsidiaries and the accumulation of cash flows generated by their operations, net of cash flows used to service debt locally and fund acquisitions outside of the United States. We believe that we are able to maintain a sufficient level of liquidity for our domestic operations and commitments without repatriation of the earnings of these foreign subsidiaries. If we were to repatriate some or all of the cash held by such foreign subsidiaries, we do not believe that the associated income tax liabilities would have a significant effect on our liquidity. 
    
  Operating activities provided net cash of   $155.7 million   and   $513.4 million   for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in cash flows from operating activities of   $357.7 million   was primarily due to a decrease in the change in net settlement processing assets of   $372.3 million  . Fluctuations in settlement processing assets and obligations are largely due to timing of month-end and transaction volume.  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $38.2 million   during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   $258.4 million   in the prior year. During the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively, we invested net cash of   $34.6 million   and   $241.5 million   in the aggregate to complete business acquisitions. We made capital expenditures of   $41.4 million   and   $16.9 million   during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively. During the twelve-month period ending May 31, 2017, we expect capital expenditures to approximate   $140 million  .   
    
  In addition, during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  , we received cash of    33.5 million   (  $37.7 million   equivalent at   June 21, 2016  )   in connection with the sale of our membership interests in Visa Europe to Visa. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $175.1 million   and   $90.1 million   during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively. During the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  , net repayments under long-term debt were   $46.2 million   compared to net borrowings of   $194.5 million   in the prior year, reflecting the July 2015 refinancing described above. 
    
  Net repayments on settlement lines of credit were   $47.3 million   and   $236.0 million   during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively. Fluctuations in our settlement lines of credit balances are largely due to timing of month-end and settlement transaction volume.  
    
  In addition, we used cash of   $67.6 million   and   $34.3 million   during the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016   and   August 31, 2015  , respectively, to repurchase shares of our common stock.

We believe that our current level of cash and borrowing capacity under our debt facilities described below, together with future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the needs of our existing operations and planned requirements for the foreseeable future.  
    
  Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities  
    
  July 2015 Refinancing  . On   July 31, 2015  , we entered into a second amended and restated term loan agreement (the "2015 Term Loan Agreement") and a second amended and restated credit agreement (the "2015 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement" and collectively, the "2015 Credit Facility Agreements") to provide for a   $1.75 billion   term loan (the "Term A Loan") and a   $1.25 billion   revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility"), each with a syndicate of financial institutions. We used the proceeds of approximately   $2.0 billion   to repay the then-outstanding balances on our previously existing term loan and revolving credit facility.  
    
  February 2016 Refinancing  . On   February 26, 2016  , we entered into an amendment to the 2015 Credit Facility Agreement (as amended, the "2016 Credit Facility Agreement") to, among other things, (i) accelerate our repayment schedule for the Term A Loan, effective as of   February 26, 2016  , and (ii) provide security for the Term A Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility and modify the applicable financial covenants and interest rate margins. In addition, the 2016 Credit Facility Agreement provided for a new   $735 million   delayed draw term loan facility (the "Delayed Draw Facility"). 
    
  We also entered into a new     $1.045 billion   term B loan ("Term B Loan"). The Delayed Draw Facility and Term B Loan were issued on April 22, 2016 in connection with our merger with Heartland, resulting in total financing of approximately   $4.78 billion  . The incremental proceeds from the new loans were used, among other things, to repay certain portions of Heartland's existing indebtedness and to finance, in part, the cash consideration and the merger-related costs. 
    
  Pursuant to the 2016 Credit Facility Agreement, the Term A Loan must be repaid in equal quarterly installments of   $43.8 million   commencing in November 2016 and ending in May 2020, with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in July 2020. The Delayed Draw Facility must be repaid in quarterly installments of $1.7 million, the first installment of which was made in August 2016, increasing to quarterly installments of $8.6 million in August 2018 and ending in May 2020, with the remaining balance due upon maturity in July 2020. The Term B Loan must be repaid in quarterly installments of $2.6 million, the first installment of which was made in September 2016,   ending in March 2023, with the remaining principal balance due upon maturity in April 2023.  
    
  As of   August 31, 2016  , the outstanding balance on the Revolving Credit Facility was   $992.5 million  . The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement allows us to issue standby letters of credit of up to   $100 million   in the aggregate under the Revolving Credit Facility. Outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility reduce the amount of borrowings available to us. Borrowings available to us under the Revolving Credit Facility are further limited by the covenants described below under "Compliance with Covenants." At   August 31, 2016   and May 31, 2016, we had outstanding issued standby letters of credit of   $21.3 million   and   $8.5 million  , respectively. The total available commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility at   August 31, 2016   and May 31, 2016 were   $236.2 million   and   $204.5 million  , respectively. The Revolving Credit Facility expires in July 2020. 
    
  Settlement Lines of Credit 
    
  We have lines of credit with banks in various markets where we do business. The lines of credit, which are restricted for use in funding settlement, generally have variable interest rates and are subject to annual review. The credit facilities are generally denominated in local currency but may, in some cases, facilitate borrowings in multiple currencies. For certain of our lines of credit, the available credit is increased by the amount of cash we have on deposit in specific accounts with the lender.  Accordingly, the amount of the outstanding line of credit may exceed the stated credit limit. As of   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , a total of   $46.6 million   and   $42.9 million  , respectively, of cash on deposit was used to determine the available credit. 
    
  As of   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , respectively, we had   $332.1 million   and   $378.4 million   outstanding under these lines of credit with additional capacity of   $744.3 million   as of   August 31, 2016   to fund settlement. The weighted-average interest rate on these borrowings was   1.98%   and   1.80%   at   August 31, 2016   and   May 31, 2016  , respectively.

Compliance with Covenants 
    
  The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement contains customary affirmative and restrictive covenants, including, among others, financial covenants based on our leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios. The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement and settlement lines of credit also include various other covenants that are customary in such borrowings. The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement includes covenants, subject in each case to exceptions and qualifications, that may restrict certain payments, including, in certain circumstances, the payment of cash dividends in excess of our current rate of $0.01 per share per quarter. 
    
  The 2016 Credit Facility Agreement also includes customary events of default, the occurrence of which, following any applicable cure period, would permit the lenders to, among other things, declare the principal, accrued interest and other obligations to be immediately due and payable. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of and for the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  . 
    
  See "Note   6   Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our borrowing arrangements. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have not entered into any transactions with unconsolidated entities whereby we have financial guarantees, subordinated retained interest, derivative instruments, or other contingent arrangements that expose us to material continuing risks, contingent liabilities, or other obligations under a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides us with financing, liquidity, market, or credit risk support other than the guarantee services described in Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   May 31, 2016  . 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which often require the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods. We discuss our critical accounting policies in Item 7, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   May 31, 2016  . During the   three   months ended   August 31, 2016  , we did not adopt any new critical accounting policies, did not change any critical accounting policies and did not change the application of any critical accounting policies from the year ended   May 31, 2016  .  
    
  Effect of New Accounting Pronouncements and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted    
    
  From time-to-time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standards setting bodies that may affect our current and/or future financial statements. See "Note   1   Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting pronouncements and recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted. 

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  Investors are cautioned that some of the statements we use in this report contain forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the "safe-harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties and depend upon future events or conditions. Actual events or results might differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee you that our plans and expectations will be achieved. Such statements may include, but are not limited to, statements about the benefits of our merger with Heartland, including future financial and operating results, the combined company s plans, objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not historical facts. Our forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made and should not be relied upon as representing our plans and expectations as of any subsequent date. We undertake no obligation to revise any of these statements to reflect future circumstances or the occurrence of unanticipated events.  

27 

     Table of Contents  

Important factors that may cause actual events or results to differ materially from those anticipated by our forward-looking statements include our ability to safeguard our data; increased competition from larger companies and non-traditional competitors; our ability to update our services in a timely manner; our ability to maintain Visa and MasterCard registration and financial institution sponsorship; our reliance on financial institutions to provide clearing services in connection with our settlement activities; our potential failure to comply with card network requirements; potential systems interruptions or failures; software defects or undetected errors; increased attrition of merchants, referral partners or independent sales organizations; our ability to increase our share of existing markets and expand into new markets; a decline in the use of cards for payment generally; unanticipated increases in chargeback liability; increases in credit card network fees; changes in laws, regulations or network rules or interpretations thereof; foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks; political, economic and regulatory changes in the foreign countries in which we operate; future performance, integration and conversion of acquired operations, including without limitation difficulties and delays in integrating the Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. business or fully realizing cost savings and other benefits of the acquisition at all or within the expected time period; loss of key personnel; and other risk factors presented in Item 1A - Risk Factors of our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended May 31, 2016. 

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates on our long-term debt and cash investments. We invest our excess cash in securities that we believe are highly liquid and marketable in the short term. These investments earn a floating rate of interest and are not held for trading or other speculative purposes. 
    
  We have term loans and a corporate credit facility that we use for general corporate purposes, as well as various lines of credit that we use to fund settlement in certain of our markets. Interest rates on these debt instruments and settlement lines of credit are based on market rates and fluctuate accordingly. As of   August 31, 2016  , there was $4.9 billion outstanding under these variable-rate debt arrangements and settlement lines of credit.  
    
  The interest earned on our cash investments and the interest paid on our debt are based on variable interest rates; therefore, the exposure of our net income to a change in interest rates is partially mitigated as an increase in rates would increase both interest income and interest expense, and a reduction in rates would decrease both interest income and interest expense. Under our current policies, we may selectively use derivative instruments, such as interest rate swaps or forward rate agreements, to manage all or a portion of our exposure to interest rate changes. We have interest rate swaps that reduce a portion of our exposure to market interest rate risk on our LIBOR-based debt as discussed in "Note   6   - Long-Term Debt and Credit Facilities" in the notes to the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Based on balances outstanding under variable-rate debt agreements and cash investment balances at   August 31, 2016  , a hypothetical increase of 100 basis points in applicable interest rates as of   August 31, 2016   would increase our annual interest expense by approximately   $41.0 million   and increase our annual interest income by approximately   $3.3 million  . 
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
    
  A substantial amount of our operations are conducted in foreign currencies.  Consequently, a portion of our revenues and expenses may be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.  We are also affected by fluctuations in exchange rates on assets and liabilities related to our foreign operations. We have not historically hedged our translation risk on foreign currency exposure, but we may do so in the future. 

ITEM 4 CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of   August 31, 2016  , management carried out, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of   August 31, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in those reports is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

     Table of Contents  

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  In April   2016  , we completed the merger with Heartland, which is being integrated into our North America segment. As part of our ongoing integration activities, we are continuing to apply our controls and procedures to the Heartland business and to augment our company-wide controls to reflect the risks inherent in an acquisition of this magnitude.  Otherwise, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended   August 31, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  We are party to a number of claims and lawsuits incidental to our business. In our opinion, the liabilities, if any, which may ultimately result from the outcome of such matters, individually or in the aggregate, are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Heartland, Heartland s board of directors, Global Payments, Data Merger Sub One, Inc. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Payments, which we refer to as "Data Merger Sub One") and Data Merger Sub Two, LLC (a wholly owned subsidiary of Global Payments, which we refer to as "Data Merger Sub Two") were named as defendants in a putative class action lawsuit challenging the proposed merger with Heartland. The suit was filed on January 8, 2016 in the New Jersey Superior Court, Mercer County, Civil Division, and is captioned Kevin Merchant v. Heartland Payment Systems, et al, L-45-16. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the directors of Heartland breached their fiduciary duties to Heartland stockholders by agreeing to sell Heartland for inadequate consideration, agreeing to improper deal protection terms in the merger agreement, failing to properly value Heartland, and filing a materially incomplete registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, the complaint alleges that Heartland, Global Payments, Merger Sub One, and Merger Sub Two aided and abetted these purported breaches of fiduciary duty. On April 12, 2016, solely to avoid the costs, disruption and distraction of further litigation, and without admitting the validity of any allegations made by the plaintiff, Heartland and Global Payments reached an agreement to settle the suit and entered into a Memorandum of Understanding to document the terms and conditions for settlement of the suit.  The proposed settlement is subject to court approval. If the proposed settlement is approved by the court, it will release all claims that were or could have been brought challenging any aspect of the merger with Heartland or the merger agreement related thereto and any disclosure made in connection therewith, under terms that will be disclosed to stockholders before final approval of the proposed settlement. The settlement, if approved, is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS           
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended May 31, 2016.

No right or interest of Grantee in the Performance Units may be pledged, encumbered, or hypothecated or be made subject to any lien, obligation, or liability of Grantee to any other party other than the Company or an Affiliate.  The Performance Units may not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of by Grantee other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution.  
  6.        Change in Control  .  If a Change in Control occurs during the Performance Period and while Grantee remains employed, then the number of Performance Units earned (each, a  CIC Earned Unit ) shall be the greater of (A) the number of Performance Units that would have been earned based on actual performance as of the effective date of the Change in Control, as determined by the Committee, or (B) the Target Award.  Fifty percent (50%) of any CIC Earned Units will be converted to actual unrestricted shares (one share per CIC Earned Unit) on the effective date of the Change in Control.  The remaining fifty percent (50%) of any CIC Earned Units will be converted to service-based Restricted Stock (one share of Restricted Stock per CIC Earned Unit) on the effective date of the Change in Control.  Such Restricted Stock will be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a Restricted Stock Award Certificate in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit B  .  
  7.      Restrictions on Issuance of Shares  .  If at any time the Committee shall determine, in its discretion, that registration, listing or qualification of the Shares underlying the Performance Units upon any securities exchange or similar self-regulatory organization or under any foreign, federal, or local law or practice, or the consent or approval of any governmental regulatory body, is necessary or desirable as a condition to the settlement of the Performance Units, stock units will not be converted to Shares in whole or in part unless and until such registration, listing, qualification, consent or approval shall have been effected or obtained free of any conditions not acceptable to the Committee.  
  8.      Limitation of Rights  .  The Performance Units do not confer to Grantee or Grantee s beneficiary, executors or administrators any rights of a shareholder of the Company unless and until Shares are in fact issued to such person in connection with the units.  Nothing in this Certificate shall interfere with or limit in any way the right of the Company or any Affiliate to terminate Grantee s employment at any time, nor confer upon Grantee any right to continue in employment of the Company or any Affiliate. 
  9.      No Entitlement to Future Awards  .  The grant of the Performance Units does not entitle Grantee to the grant of any additional units or other awards under the Plan in the future.  Future grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the timing of any grant, the number of units, and vesting provisions.   
  10.      Payment of Taxes  .

The withholding requirement may be satisfied, in whole or in part, at the election of the Company s general counsel, principal financial officer or chief accounting officer, by withholding from the settlement of the stock units Shares having a Fair Market Value on the date of withholding equal to the minimum amount (and not any greater amount) required to be withheld for tax purposes, all in accordance with such procedures as such officer establishes.  The obligations of the Company under this Certificate will be conditional on such payment or arrangements, and the Company and, where applicable, its Affiliates will, to the extent permitted by law, have the right to deduct any such taxes from any payment of any kind otherwise due to Grantee. 
  11.      Amendment  .  The Committee may amend, modify or terminate this Certificate without approval of Grantee; provided, however, that such amendment, modification or termination shall not, without Grantee s consent, reduce or diminish the value of this award determined as if it had been fully vested (i.e., as if all restrictions on the Performance Units hereunder had expired) on the date of such amendment or termination. 
  12.      Plan Controls  .  The terms contained in the Plan shall be and are hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Certificate and this Certificate shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Plan.  Without limiting the foregoing, the terms and conditions of the Performance Units, including the number of shares and the class or series of capital stock which may be delivered upon settlement of the Performance Units, are subject to adjustment as provided in Article 15 of the Plan and are subject to Section 17.3 of the Plan related to Code Section 409A.  In the event of any actual or alleged conflict between the provisions of the Plan and the provisions of this Certificate, the provisions of the Plan shall be controlling and determinative. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Certificate and the terms of a written employment, key position, or change-in-control agreement with Grantee, the provisions of the written employment, key position, or change-in-control agreement shall be controlling and determinative.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Certificate, the Plan, or any employment, key position, or change-in-control agreement with Grantee, the award granted hereunder is subject to the provisions of the following clawback policy established by the Committee prior to the grant of the Performance Units hereunder. The Committee may seek to recoup all or any portion of the value of any annual or long-term incentive awards provided to any current or former executive officers in the event that the Company s financial statements are restated due to the Company s material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under the securities laws (the  Restatement ).  The Committee may seek recoupment from any current or former executive officer who received incentive-based compensation, granted after the date hereof, during the three (3) year period preceding the date that the Company was required to prepare the Restatement.  The Committee may seek to recover the amount by which the individual executive's incentive payments exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results and the Committee may determine whether the Company shall effect such recovery:  (i) by seeking repayment from the executive; (ii) by reducing (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or arrangement) the amount that would otherwise be payable to the executive under any compensatory plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Company; or (iii) a combination of foregoing.

The Committee may seek recoupment from any current or former executive officer who received incentive-based compensation, granted after the date hereof, during the three (3) year period preceding the date that the Company was required to prepare the Restatement.  The Committee may seek to recover the amount by which the individual executive's incentive payments exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results and the Committee may determine whether the Company shall effect such recovery:  (i) by seeking repayment from the executive; (ii) by reducing (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or arrangement) the amount that would otherwise be payable to the executive under any compensatory plan, program or arrangement maintained by the Company; or (iii) a combination of foregoing.

Each Eligible Participant shall be paid a Basic Cash Retainer for service as a director during each Plan Year, payable in advance, on the first business day following each annual meeting of shareholders.

Subject to share availability under the 2011 Incentive Plan, each Eligible Participant shall be granted an award of fully-vested Stock on the day that he or she first becomes an Eligible Participant ( Initial Stock Grant ).  In addition, subject to share availability under the 2011 Incentive Plan, each Eligible Participant in service on the day following an annual shareholders meeting will receive an award of fully-vested Stock ( Annual Stock Grant  and collectively with the Initial Stock Grant, the  Stock Grants ).  Each such day that such awards are to be granted under the Plan is referred to hereinafter as a  Grant Date.   The Stock Grants shall have the following terms and conditions: 
  
   4 

(a)        Number of Initial Stock Grants  .  The number of shares in the Initial Stock Grant to an Eligible Participant shall be determined by multiplying the Proration Factor (as defined below) by the amount determined by (A) dividing the Annual Stock Retainer as in effect for that Plan Year, by the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the Grant Date, and (B) rounding to the nearest whole number.  The Proration Factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of service as a Non-Employee Director between the Grant Date and the next annual shareholders  meeting date, and the denominator of which is 12. 
  (b)        Number of Annual Stock Grants  .  The number of shares in the Annual Stock Grant to an Eligible Participant shall be determined by (A) dividing the Annual Stock Retainer as in effect for that Plan Year, by the Fair Market Value of the Stock on the Grant Date, and (B) rounding to the nearest whole number.   
  (c)        Other Plan Conditions  .  To the extent not specified herein, the Stock Grants shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the 2011 Incentive Plan.       
   
  6.2.        ADJUSTMENTS  .    For the avoidance of doubt, the adjustment provisions of the 2011 Incentive Plan (along with all of the other provisions of the 2011 Incentive Plan) shall apply with respect to all Equity Awards granted pursuant to this Plan.       
   
  6.3.        AWARD CERTIFICATES.    All unvested Equity Awards granted pursuant to this Plan shall be evidenced by a written award certificate, which shall include such provisions, not inconsistent with the Plan or the 2011 Incentive Plan, as may be specified by the Committee.  The form of applicable award certificates (if any) shall be approved by the Committee. 

ARTICLE 7 
  AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION 
    
    7.1.        AMENDMENT, MODIFICATION AND TERMINATION  .   The Committee may, at any time and from time to time, amend, modify or terminate the Plan without shareholder approval; provided, however, that if an amendment to the Plan would, in the reasonable opinion of the Committee, require shareholder approval under applicable laws, policies or regulations or the applicable listing or other requirements of a securities exchange on which the Stock is listed or traded, then such amendment shall be subject to shareholder approval; and provided further, that the Committee  may condition any other amendment or modification on the approval of shareholders of the Company for any reason.  Modification of Equity Awards granted under this Plan shall be subject to the provisions of the 2011 Incentive Plan. 

ARTICLE 8 
  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
    
    8.1.        DURATION OF THE PLAN  .    The Plan shall remain in effect until terminated by the Committee or the earlier termination or expiration of the 2011 Incentive Plan, including any successor plans.
