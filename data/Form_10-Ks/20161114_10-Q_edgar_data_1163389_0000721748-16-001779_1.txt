NEW PEOPLES BANKSHARES, INC.  

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

NOTE 1 NATURE OF OPERATIONS:  

New Peoples Bankshares, Inc. ( The Company )
is a financial holding company whose principal activity is the ownership and management of a community bank. New Peoples Bank,
Inc. ( Bank ) was organized and incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia on December 9, 1997. The
Bank commenced operations on October 28, 1998, after receiving regulatory approval. As a state-chartered member bank, the Bank
is subject to regulation by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal
Reserve Bank. The Bank provides general banking services to individuals, small and medium size businesses and the professional
community of southwestern Virginia, southern West Virginia, and eastern Tennessee. On June 9, 2003, the Company formed two wholly-owned
subsidiaries; NPB Financial Services, Inc. and NPB Web Services, Inc. On July 7, 2004 the Company established NPB Capital Trust
I for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities. On September 27, 2006, the Company established NPB Capital Trust 2 for
the purpose of issuing additional trust preferred securities. NPB Financial Services, Inc. was a subsidiary of the Company until
January 1, 2009 when it became a subsidiary of the Bank. In June 2012 the name of NPB Financial Services, Inc. was changed to
NPB Insurance Services, Inc. which operates solely as an insurance agency. On March 4, 2016 the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond
approved the Company s election to become a financial holding company. In July 2016, the Bank and its wholly-owned subsidiary
NPB Insurance Services, Inc. announced by press release it is teaming up with The Hilb Group of Virginia dba CSE Insurance Services,
a division of the Hilb Group, LLC ( CSE ), located in Abingdon, Virginia, to provide insurance services for its current
and future customers. Effective July 1, 2016, NPB Insurance Services, Inc. sold its existing book of business to CSE. These customers
will be serviced by CSE and the Bank will refer future insurance needs of its bank customers to CSE. 

NOTE 2 ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES:  

These consolidated financial statements conform
to U. S. generally accepted accounting principles and to general industry practices. In the opinion of management, the accompanying
consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring accruals) necessary to present
fairly the Company s financial position at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and the results of operations for the
three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The notes included herein should be read in conjunction with the
notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. 

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
The determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the determination of the deferred tax asset and related
valuation allowance are based on estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes in the economic environment
and market conditions. 

NOTE 3 FORMAL WRITTEN AGREEMENT:  

The Company and the Bank had previously entered into
the Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of
Financial Institutions under which the Company and the Bank were required to take certain actions and implement certain
plans. On February 2, 2016, the Company and the Bank announced that they had successfully complied with all of the
requirements of the Written Agreement and accordingly, effective January 20, 2016, the agreement had been terminated. 

NOTE 4 CAPITAL:  

Capital Requirements and Ratios   

The Bank is subject to various capital requirements
administered by federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and, possibly,
additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Bank s financial
statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific
capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated
under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the
regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 

Quantitative measures established by regulation
to ensure capital adequacy require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the following table) of total
and Tier 1 capital (as defined) to risk-weighted assets (as defined), Tier 1 capital (as defined) to average assets (as defined),
and Common Equity Tier 1 capital (as defined) to risk-weighted assets (as defined). As of September 30, 2016, the Bank meets all
capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject. 

The Company meets eligibility criteria of
a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve Board s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement
issued in February 2015, and is no longer obligated to report consolidated regulatory capital. The Bank continues to be subject
to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies. The Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios are presented
in the following table as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These ratios comply with Federal Reserve
rules to align with the Basel III Capital requirements effective January 1, 2015. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Bank was well
capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, an institution
must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based, Tier 1 leverage, and Common Equity Tier 1 ratios as set forth in the
above tables. There are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the Bank s
category. 

Beginning January 1, 2016, a capital conservation
buffer of 0.625% became effective. The capital conservation buffer will be gradually increased through January 1, 2019 to 2.5%.
Banks will be required to maintain levels that meet the required minimum plus the capital conservation buffer in order to make
distributions, such as dividends, or discretionary bonus payments. 

NOTE 5 INVESTMENT SECURITIES:  

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities
(all available-for-sale ( AFS )) are as follows: 

The following table details unrealized losses
and related fair values in the available-for-sale portfolio. This information is aggregated by the length of time that individual
securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

At September 30, 2016, the available-for-sale portfolio
included forty two investments for which the fair market value was less than amortized cost. At December 31, 2015,
the available-for-sale portfolio included one hundred and thirty four investments for which the fair market value was less
than amortized cost. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis,  or
more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. Consideration is given to (1) the length of time
and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial conditions and near-term prospects of the
issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient
to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value. Based on the Company s analysis, the Company concluded that no
securities had an other-than-temporary impairment. 

Investment securities with a carrying value
of $11.8 million and $15.4 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, were pledged as collateral to secure
public deposits and for other purposes required by law. 

Gross proceeds on the sale of investment securities
were $24.8 million and $7.1 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Gross realized gains
and losses pertaining to the sale of investment securities available for sale are detailed as follows: 

The amortized cost and fair value of investment
securities at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown in the following schedule. Expected maturities will differ
from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment
penalties. 

The Bank, as a member of the Federal Reserve
Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank, is required to hold stock in each. The Bank also owns stock in CBB Financial Corp., which
is a correspondent of the Bank. These equity securities are restricted from trading and are recorded at a cost of $2.6 million
and $2.4 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 6 LOANS:  

Loans receivable outstanding are summarized
as follows: 

Loans receivable on nonaccrual status
are summarized as follows: 

Total interest income not recognized on nonaccrual
loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $397 thousand and $486 thousand, respectively. 

The following table presents information concerning
the Company s investment in loans considered impaired as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The following table presents information concerning
the Company s average impaired loans and interest recognized on those impaired loans, for the periods indicated: 

An age analysis of past due loans receivable
was as follows: 

The
Company categorizes loans receivable into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service
their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and
current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans receivable as to
credit risk. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings:  

Pass
 - Loans in this category are considered to have a low likelihood of loss based on relevant information analyzed about the
ability of the borrowers to service their debt and other factors.  

Special
Mention  - Loans in this category are currently protected but are potentially weak, including adverse trends in borrower s
operations, credit quality or financial strength. Those loans constitute an undue and unwarranted credit risk but not to the point
of justifying a substandard classification. The credit risk may be relatively minor yet constitute an unwarranted risk in light
of the circumstances.  Special mention loans have potential weaknesses which may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the
loan or inadequately protect the Company s credit position at some future date.  

Substandard
 -  A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound net worth and paying capacity
of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans classified as substandard must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses
that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt; they are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain
some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.   

Doubtful
 -   Loans classified Doubtful have all the
weaknesses inherent in loans classified as Substandard, plus the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation
in full on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values highly questionable and improbable.  

Based
on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans receivable was as follows:  

NOTE
7 ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES:   

The
following table details activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment for the period ended September 30, 2016.
Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other
categories.  

The
following table details activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio segment for the period ended December 31, 2015.
Allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other
categories.  

In
determining the amount of our allowance, we rely on an analysis of our loan portfolio, our experience and our evaluation of general
economic conditions, as well as the requirements of the written agreement and other regulatory input. If our assumptions prove
to be incorrect, our current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses and we may experience significant increases
to our provision.  

NOTE
8 TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS:   

At
September 30, 2016 there were $9.4 million in loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings compared to $9.5 million
at December 31, 2015. The following table presents information related to loans modified as troubled debt restructurings during
the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company modified the terms of two loans for which the modification was considered
to be a troubled debt restructuring. On one loan the interest rate and maturity date were not modified; however, the payment terms
were changed. On one loan the interest rate was lowered and the payment terms and maturity date were changed. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, the Company modified the terms of three loans for which the modification was considered to be
a troubled debt restructuring. On two of the loans we modified the terms and lowered the interest rate. On one loan the interest
rate was not modified; however, the maturity date was extended.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company modified no loans that were considered to be a troubled debt restructuring.
During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the Company modified the terms of two loans for which the modification was considered
to be a troubled debt restructuring. On the two loans we modified the terms and lowered the interest rate.  

One commercial real estate loan with a recorded
investment of $302 thousand that had been modified as a troubled debt restructuring defaulted during the nine months ended September
30, 2016, which was within twelve months of the loan s modification date. No loans modified as troubled debt restructurings
defaulted during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. No loans modified as troubled debt restructurings defaulted during the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, which were within twelve months of their modification date. Generally, a troubled
debt restructuring is considered to be in default once it becomes 90 days or more past due following a modification. 

In determination of the allowance for loan
losses, management considers troubled debt restructurings and subsequent defaults in these restructurings in its estimate. The
Company evaluates all troubled debt restructurings for possible further impairment. As a result, the allowance may be increased,
adjustments may be made in the allocation of the allowance, or charge-offs may be taken to further writedown the carrying value
of the loan. 

NOTE
9 OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED:   

The
following table summarizes the activity in other real estate owned for the  nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year
ended December 31, 2015:  

NOTE
10 EARNINGS PER SHARE:    

Basic
earnings per share computations are based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each period. Dilutive earnings
per share reflect the additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued.
Potential common shares that may be issued relate to outstanding options and common stock warrants are determined by the Treasury
method. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, potential common shares of 882,178 and 1,539,877, respectively,
were anti-dilutive and were not included in the calculation. Basic and diluted net income per common share calculations follows:  

NOTE
11 TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES AND DEFERRAL OF INTEREST PAYMENTS:   

On
July 7, 2004, the Company completed the issuance of $11.3 million in floating rate trust preferred securities offered by its wholly
owned subsidiary, NPB Capital Trust I. The proceeds of the funds were used for general corporate purposes which included capital
management for affiliates, retirement of indebtedness and other investments. The securities have a floating rate of 3 month LIBOR
plus 260 basis points, which resets quarterly, with a current rate at September 30, 2016 of 3.28%.  

On
September 27, 2006, the Company completed the issuance of $5.2 million in floating rate trust preferred securities offered by
its wholly owned subsidiary, NPB Capital Trust 2. The proceeds of the funds were used for general corporate purposes, which include
capital management for affiliates and the acquisition of two branch banks. The securities have a floating rate of 3 month LIBOR
plus 177 basis points, which resets quarterly, with a current rate at September 30, 2016 of 2.45%.  

Under
the terms of the subordinated debt transactions, the securities mature in 30 years from the date of issuance and are redeemable,
in whole or in part, without penalty, at the option of the Company after five years. Due to the ability to defer interest and
principal payments for 60 months without being considered in default, the regulatory agencies consider the trust preferred securities
as Tier 1 capital up to certain limits.  

In
October 2009, a restriction to pay dividends from the Bank to the Company was issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.
In July 2010, the Company and the Bank entered into the Written Agreement discussed in Note 3. The Written Agreement prohibited
the payment of interest on the trust preferred securities without prior regulatory approval. As a result, interest on trust preferred
securities was deferred. This deferral was for a period of 60 months, and was set to expire on January 7, 2015. In the fourth
quarter of 2014, the Company requested and received regulatory approval to pay the cumulative deferred interest on the trust preferred
securities due on January 7, 2015 totaling $2.5 million, which the Company paid on December 10, 2014. As a result of this payment
there has been no interest in arrears on the trust preferred securities since that date.  

The
Company is currently not deferring the quarterly interest payments on the trust preferred securities. However, as discussed above,
regulatory approval was needed to pay the interest while the Company was under the formal Written Agreement. In March 2015 the
Company requested and received regulatory approval to pay the $107 thousand in interest on the trust preferred securities due
on April 7, 2015, which the Company paid on April 3, 2015. In June 2015 the Company requested and received regulatory approval
to pay the $109 thousand in interest on the trust preferred securities due on July 7, 2015, which the Company paid on July 2,
2015. In September 2015 the Company requested and received regulatory approval to pay the $111 thousand in interest on the trust
preferred securities due on October 7, 2015, which the Company paid on October 5, 2015. In December 2015 the Company requested
and received regulatory approval to pay the $112 thousand in interest on the trust preferred securities due on January 7, 2016,
which the Company paid on January 5, 2016.  

The
restriction requiring regulatory approval before the payment of interest on the trust preferred securities was lifted when the
Written Agreement was terminated effective January 20, 2016. On April 4, 2016, the Company paid $124 thousand in interest on the
trust preferred securities, which was due on April 7, 2016. On July 6, 2016 the Company paid $124 thousand in interest on the
trust preferred securities, which was due on July 7, 2016. On October 4, 2016 the Company paid $127 thousand in interest on the
trust preferred securities, which was due on October 7, 2016.  

NOTE
12 FAIR VALUES:    

The
financial reporting standard,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  provides a framework for measuring fair value
under generally accepted accounting principles and requires disclosures about the fair value of assets and liabilities recognized
in the balance sheet in periods subsequent to initial recognition, whether the measurements are made on a recurring basis (for
example, available-for-sale investment securities) or on a nonrecurring basis (for example, impaired loans and other real estate
acquired through foreclosure).  

Fair
value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures also establish a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use
of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels
of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity
securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an exchange market, as well as U. S. Treasury, other U. S. Government and
agency mortgage-backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets.  

Level
2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets
that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded
less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with
inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category
generally includes certain derivative contracts and impaired loans.  

Level
3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets
and liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models,
discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires
significant management judgment or estimation. For example, this category generally includes certain private equity investments,
retained residual interests in securitizations, residential mortgage servicing rights, and highly structured or long-term derivative
contracts.  

Investment
Securities Available-for-Sale    Investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis.
Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices. The Company s available-for-sale securities, totaling $74.6 million
and $101.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are the only assets whose fair values are measured
on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs from an independent pricing service.  

Loans
-  The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. Real estate serves as collateral on a substantial
majority of the Company s loans. When a loan is considered impaired a specific reserve may be established. Loans which are
deemed to be impaired and require a reserve are primarily valued on a non-recurring basis at the fair values of the underlying
real estate collateral. Such fair values are obtained using independent appraisals, which management evaluates and determines
whether or not the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market
price, or whether or not an appraised value does not include estimated costs of disposition. The Company records impaired loans
as nonrecurring Level 3 assets. The aggregate carrying amounts of impaired loans carried at fair value were $14.2 million and
$16.3 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Foreclosed
Assets      Foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed assets. 
Foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of the carrying value or fair value.  Fair value is based upon independent observable
market prices or appraised values of the collateral with a third party less an estimate of disposition costs, which the Company
considers to be level 2 inputs. When the appraised value is not available, management determines the fair value of the collateral
if further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, or an appraised value does not include
estimated costs of disposition and management must make an estimate, the Company records the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring
Level 3. The aggregate carrying amounts of foreclosed assets were $13.2 million and $12.4 million at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively.  

Assets
and liabilities measured at fair value are as follows as of September 30, 2016 (for purpose of this table the impaired loans are
shown net of the related allowance):

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair
value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practical to estimate
the value is based upon the characteristics of the instruments and relevant market information. Financial instruments include
cash, evidence of ownership in an entity, or contracts that convey or impose on an entity that contractual right or obligation
to either receive or deliver cash for another financial instrument.  

The
following summary presents the methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the Company s financial
instruments presented below. The information used to determine fair value is highly subjective and judgmental in nature and, therefore,
the results may not be precise. Subjective factors include, among other things, estimates of cash flows, risk characteristics,
credit quality, and interest rates, all of which are subject to change. Since the fair value is estimated as of the balance sheet
date, the amounts that will actually be realized or paid upon settlement or maturity on these various instruments could be significantly
different.  

The
following presents the carrying amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company s financial
instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. This table excludes financial instruments for which the carrying amount
approximates fair value. The carrying value of cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits, deposits
with no stated maturities, trust preferred securities and accrued interest approximates fair value. The remaining financial instruments
were valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at various rates in effect for similar instruments
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

NOTE
13 RECENT ACCOUNTING DEVELOPMENTS:   

The
following is a summary of recent authoritative announcements:  

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued guidance to change the recognition of revenue from
contracts with customers. The core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to reflect the transfer
of goods and services to customers in an amount equal to the consideration the entity receives or expects to receive. The guidance
will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company will apply the guidance
using a modified retrospective approach. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements.  

In
January 2015, the FASB issued guidance to eliminate from U.S. GAAP the concept of an extraordinary item, which is an event or
transaction that is both (1) unusual in nature and (2) infrequently occurring. Under the new guidance, an entity will no longer
(1) segregate an extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations; (2) separately present an extraordinary item on its
income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; or (3) disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data
applicable to an extraordinary item. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning
of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company applied the guidance prospectively. Adoption of these amendments did not have a material
effect on the Company s financial statements.  

In
February 2015, the FASB issued guidance which amends the consolidation requirements and significantly changes the consolidation
analysis required under U.S. GAAP. Although the amendments are expected to result in the deconsolidation of many entities, the
Company will need to reevaluate all its previous consolidation conclusions. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted (including during
an interim period), provided that the guidance is applied as of the beginning of the annual period containing the adoption date.
Adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.  

In
June 2015, the FASB issued amendments to clarify the Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ), correct unintended
application of guidance, and make minor improvements to the ASC that are not expected to have a significant effect on current
accounting practice or create a significant cost to most entities. The amendments were effective upon issuance (June 12, 2015)
for amendments that do not have transition guidance. Amendments that are subject to transition guidance will be effective for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including
adoption in an interim period. Adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.  

In
August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. As a result of the deferral
the guidance in ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company
does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In
August 2015, the FASB issued amendments to the Interest topic of the ASC to clarify the SEC staff s position on presenting
and measuring debt issuance costs incurred in connection with line-of-credit arrangements. The amendments were effective upon
issuance. Adoption of these amendments did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements.  

In
January 2016, the FASB amended the Financial Instruments topic of the ASC to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement,
presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the guidance by means of a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities
without readily determinable fair values will be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption
of the amendments. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB amended the Leases topic of the ASC to revise certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation,
and disclosure of leasing transactions. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of the new standard
will have on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.  

In
March 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of the ASC to clarify the implementation guidance
on principal versus agent considerations and address how an entity should assess whether it is the principal or the agent in contracts
that include three or more parties. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions
including the income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on
the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the guidance simplifies two areas specific to entities other than public business entities
allowing them to apply a practical expedient to estimate the expected term for all awards with performance or service conditions
that have certain characteristics and also allowing them to make a one-time election to switch from measuring all liability-classified
awards at fair value to measuring them at intrinsic value. The amendments will be effective for the Company for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect these amendments
to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of the ASC to clarify guidance related to identifying
performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The amendments will be effective for the Company
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect
on its financial statements.  

In
May 2016, the FASB amended the Revenue from Contracts with Customers topic of the ASC to clarify guidance related to collectability,
noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its financial
statements.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued guidance to change the accounting for credit losses and modify the impairment model for certain debt
securities. The amendments will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company
is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of the new standard will have on its financial position, results of operations,
and cash flows.  

In
August 2016, the FASB amended the Statement of Cash Flows topic of the ASC to clarify how certain cash receipts and cash payments
are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments will be effective for the Company for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2017 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect these amendments
to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have
a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Caution
About Forward Looking Statements   

We
make forward looking statements in this quarterly report that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward looking statements
include statements regarding our profitability, liquidity, allowance for loan losses, interest rate sensitivity, market risk,
business strategy, and financial and other goals. The words  believes,   expects,   may, 
 will,   should,   projects,   contemplates,   anticipates,   forecasts, 
 intends,  or other similar words or terms are intended to identify forward looking statements.  

Certain
information contained in this discussion may include  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking
statements contain the Company s expectations, plans, future financial performance, and other statements that are not historical
facts. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by phrases such as  the Company expects,   the
Company believes  or words of similar importance. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks including,
but not limited to, changes in general economic and business conditions, interest rate fluctuations, competition within and from
outside the banking industry, new products and services in the banking industry, risk inherent in making loans such as repayment
risks and fluctuating collateral values, problems with technology utilized by the Company, changing trends in customer profiles
and changes in laws and regulations applicable to the Company. Although the Company believes that its expectations with respect
to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of its knowledge of its business and
operations, there can be no assurance that actual results, performance or achievements of the Company will not differ materially
from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  

Because
of these uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward looking
statements. In addition, our past results of operations do not necessarily indicate our future results.  

Written
Agreement   

The
Company and the Bank had previously entered into the Written Agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and the
Virginia State Corporation Commission Bureau of Financial Institutions under which the Company and the Bank were required to take certain actions and implement certain
plans.. On February 2, 2016, the Company and the Bank
announced that they had successfully complied with all of the requirements of the Written Agreement and accordingly,
effective January 20, 2016, the agreement had been terminated.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

For
discussion of our significant accounting policies see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain
critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.
Our most critical accounting policies relate to our provision for loan losses and the calculation of our deferred tax asset and
related valuation allowance.  

The
provision for loan losses reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments.
If the financial condition of our borrowers were to further deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments,
our estimates would be updated, and additional provisions could be required.  

Our
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method. Under this method, the
net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences between the book and tax
bases of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in tax rates and laws. If all
or a portion of the net deferred tax asset is determined to be unlikely to be realized in the foreseeable future, a valuation
allowance is established to reduce the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. For further
discussion of the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance, we refer you to the section on  Deferred Tax Asset and Income
Taxes  below.  

Overview   

The Company had net income for the quarter
ended September 30, 2016 of $346 thousand, or basic net income per share of $0.01, as compared to a net income of $2.3 million,
or basic net income per share of $0.10, for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. This is a decrease of $1.9 million, or 84.91%.
The decrease was mainly driven by a negative provision for loan losses of $1.2 million during the third quarter 2015 compared to
no provision for loans losses during the third quarter 2016. Also we had a $415 thousand decrease in net interest income and an
$817 thousand increase in noninterest expenses during the quarter, which was offset somewhat by a $266 increase in noninterest
income. The Company had net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1.9 million, or basic net income per share
of $0.08, as compared to the nine months ending September 30, 2015 whereby the Company had net income of $3.4 million, or $0.15
basic net income per share. This is a decrease $1.5 million, or $0.07 per share. 

Quarter-to-Date
Results    

Highlights
from the third quarter of 2016 include:  

The
                                         Bank is considered well-capitalized under regulatory standards;     

The
                                         Bank opened a loan production office in Jonesborough, Tennessee; and,    

In the third quarter of 2016, our net interest
margin was 3.92%, as compared to 3.99% for the same period in 2015, a decrease of 7 basis points. The Company s primary source
of income, net interest income, decreased $215 thousand, or 3.79%, to $5.5 million for the third quarter of 2016 from $5.7 million
for the same period in 2015. Loan interest income decreased $157 thousand, or 2.67%, from $5.9 million for the third quarter of
2015 to $5.7 million for the third quarter of 2016. While we have been successful in our strategy to conservatively grow the loan
portfolio, renewed loans are repricing at lower rates and new loans are being booked at lower interest rates due to competitive
pressures. Investment interest income decreased $123 thousand to $334 thousand for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $457
thousand for the third quarter of 2015 due to liquidation of the investment portfolio used to fund loan growth. Interest expense
decreased $57 thousand, or 7.83%, from $728 thousand for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 to $671 thousand for the same quarter
of 2016 as a result of time deposits re-pricing at lower interest rates at maturity, as well as a favorable shift in the deposit
mix whereby our higher-cost time deposits were replaced with lower-cost deposit products. 

No provision for loan losses was recorded in
the third quarter of 2016 as we continue to see improved loan quality. A negative provision of $1.2 million was recorded during
the third quarter of 2015. See  Asset Quality  below for further discussion of $1.2 million negative provision for
third quarter 2015. 

Noninterest income for the third quarter of
2016 was $2.0 million, which is an increase of $266 thousand when compared to the $1.8 million for the same period in 2015. In
June 2016, we began offering the Optional Overdraft Protection Service and Optional Overdraft Protection Service Plus products
to our deposit customers. As a result our nonsufficient funds income and overdraft income increased by $287 thousand during the
quarter when compared to the same quarter in 2015. We expect nonsufficient funds income and overdraft income to increase in the
future as customers utilize these new services. 

Noninterest expense increased $817 thousand,
or 12.89%, to $7.2 million for the third quarter 2016 as compared to $6.3 million for the third quarter of 2015. Salaries and employee
benefits increased $413 thousand, or 13.80% in the quarter-to-quarter comparison from $3.0 million at September 30, 2015 to $3.4
million for the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily the result of seasoned commercial bankers hired during the fourth
quarter of 2015 and first nine months of 2016 as a part of our strategy to grow the loan portfolio, the opening of a loan production
office in Jonesborough, Tennessee, as well as staff added to operate the newly implemented Interactive Teller Machines ( ITMs ).
Occupancy and equipment expenses increased $216 thousand from $905 thousand for the third quarter of 2015 to $1.1 million for the
third quarter of 2016. The increase in occupancy and equipment expenses was mainly due to the rollout of the ITMs during the first
nine months quarter of 2016. The ITMs, a new, state-of-the-art technology which replaced the Bank s ATMs, will help provide
additional convenience by providing teller services from 7 AM to 7 PM Monday thru Saturday. The anticipate the addition of the
ITMs will create efficiencies in the future. Other real estate owned and repossessed asset expenses increased $15 thousand, or
4.52%, to $347 thousand for the third quarter of 2016 as compared to $332 thousand for the same period in 2015. 

Year-to-Date Results   

Highlights from the first nine months of 2016
include: 

Net interest income year-to-date for September
30, 2016 was $16.3 million, which was a decline of $373 thousand, or 2.24%, when compared to the same period in 2015. Loan interest
income for the first nine months of 2016 decreased $685 thousand, or 3.89%, from $17.6 million as of September 30, 2015 to $16.9
million as of September 30, 2016. 

This decrease is primarily related to continued
high level of nonaccrual loans, and new and renewal loans being booked at lower interest rates. Mostly offsetting the decline in
interest income from loans was the decline in interest paid on deposits. Interest expense on deposits declined $507 thousand, for
the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, when comparing it to the same period in 2015. The main driver in the decline in interest
expense on deposits is the 6.86%, or $18.2 million, decline in time deposits when comparing the balances at September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. Also aiding in the decline in deposit expense is the favorable shift in the deposit mix of higher-costing
time deposits to lower-costing non-time deposits. 

A
negative provision of $500 thousand was recorded in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to a $1.2 million negative provision
for the same period in 2015. The $500 thousand negative provision was made as a result of improved loan quality. See  Asset
Quality  below for further discussion.  

Year-to-date September 30, 2016, noninterest
income increased to $5.4 million from $4.8 million in 2015, an increase of $620 thousand or 13.02%. This increase was primarily
due to the $240 thousand gain on the sale of investment securities during the first nine months, compared to the $35 thousand gain
on the sale of investment securities for the same period in 2015. In addition our nonsufficient funds / overdraft income increased
by $308 thousand during the first nine months of 2016 as a result of the new optional overdraft protection services we began offering
to our deposit customers in June 2016. 

Noninterest expense increased $1.1 million,
or 5.30%, for the first nine months of 2016 from $19.2 million as of September 30, 2015 to $20.3 million as of September 30, 2016.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, salaries and employee benefits increased $1.2 million, or 12.91%, to $10.0 million
as compared to $8.8 million for the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily the result of seasoned commercial bankers
hired during the fourth quarter of 2015 and first nine months of 2016 as a part of our strategy to grow the loan portfolio, expand
our market presence in the Tri-Cities, Tennessee area, as well as staff added to operate the ITMs. Total full time equivalent employees
have increased to 258 at September 30, 2016 from 247 at September 30, 2015, an increase of 11, or 4.45%. Other real estate owned
and repossessed asset expenses decreased $799 thousand, or 57.15%, to $599 thousand for the first nine months of 2016 as compared
to $1.4 million for the same period in 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, we had net gains on the sale of other real estate
owned of $290 thousand as compared to a net gain on the sale of other real estate owned of $10 thousand for the same period in
2015. Net writedowns on other real estate owned were $165 thousand for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to net writedowns
of $784 thousand for the same period in 2015. 

Balance
Sheet    

Total assets increased $8.0 million, or 1.27%,
to $633.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $625.9 million at December 31, 2015. Loans showed an increase of $23.5 million as
a result of our efforts to conservatively grow the loan portfolio, which was funded by selling investment securities during the
first nine months of 2016. 

Total investments decreased $27.0 million,
or 26.64%, to $74.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $101.6 million at December 31, 2015. We sold $24.8 million in investment
securities during the first nine months of 2016. These sales resulted in net realized gains of $240 thousand. These sales were
executed to provide liquidity to fund loan growth and to take advantage of gains in the investment portfolio as deemed appropriate.
Interest bearing deposits with banks increased $4.5 million, or 4.02%, in the first nine months of 2016 to $15.8 million from $11.3
million at December 31, 2015. 

Total loans increased $23.5 million, or 5.34%, to $464.7
million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $441.2 million at December 31, 2015. Our strategy is to conservatively grow
assets, namely the loan portfolio. To assist in these efforts, we have added several commercial lenders, during the latter
part of 2015 and first nine months of 2016, mostly focused in the Tri-Cities market of Bristol, VA and TN, Kingsport, TN, and
Johnson City, TN. We expect the trend in total loan growth we have experienced in the first nine months of 2016 to continue
at least in the near term, subject to economic conditions, customer demand, and competition in our markets. During the
third quarter of 2016, we introduced new lending products that we anticipate will help us further service our customers,
generate loan growth and enhance earnings. These include secondary market mortgage loans, Small Business Administration
loans and credit cards. 

Total
deposits decreased $1.5 million from $558.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $556.5 million at September 30, 2016. Noninterest
bearing deposits increased 2.15%, or $3.2 million, from $149.7 million at December 31, 2015 to $152.9 million at September 30,
2016. We experienced an increase of $10.3 million, or 34.29%, in interest-bearing demand deposits during the first nine months
of 2016. We have experienced a $6.1 million, or 5.01%, decrease in non-maturity deposits. Time deposits decreased by $9.0 million,
or 3.51%, from $257.0 million at December 31, 2015 to $248.0 million at September 30, 2016. Overall, we continue to maintain core
deposits through attractive consumer and commercial deposit products and strong ties with our customer base and communities. The
shift from higher-costing time deposits to lower-costing deposit products represents a favorable repositioning of the Company s
deposit mix. We have recently increased our interest rates on time deposits in an effort to stop shrinking the bank, to help provide
funds for loan growth, and to increase deposit market share. Existing higher cost deposits should continue to reprice at lower
interest rates, but the level of these higher yielding deposits is decreasing; thus, the opportunity to continue decreasing interest
expense will diminish.  

Total
borrowings increased to $9.1 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $6.1 million from the $3.0 million outstanding balance
at December 31, 2015. Borrowings decreased $900 thousand during the first nine months of 2016 due to regularly scheduled principal
payments on the $3.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2015. In June 2016, we borrowed $7.0 million in advances from the Federal
Home Loan Bank to take advantage of lower interest rates to also help fund our loan growth as we work to grow our deposits and
loans.  

Total
equity at September 30, 2016 was $48.8 million. That represents an increase of $2.7 million, or 5.85%, when compared to the December
31, 2015 balance of $46.1 million. Net income of $1.9 million and the $772 thousand increase in other comprehensive income resulting
from an increase in net unrealized gains in the investment portfolio during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were the
drivers of the increase in equity.  

Asset
Quality    

We
continue to make progress in reducing the levels of non-performing assets. However, as asset quality improves, the level of nonperforming
assets remains elevated as a result of the prolonged deteriorated residential and commercial real estate markets, as well as the
sluggish economy. Loans rated substandard decreased $3.5 million, or 17.47%, to $16.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $19.7
million at December 31, 2015.  

The
ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets lowered to 4.20% at September 30, 2016 as compared to 4.35% at December 31, 2015.
Nonperforming assets, which include nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned and past due loans greater than 90 days still accruing
interest, decreased to $26.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $27.2 million at December 31, 2015, a reduction of $603 thousand,
or 2.21%. We continue undertaking extensive and more aggressive measures to work out problem credits and liquidate foreclosed
properties in an effort to accelerate a reduction of nonperforming assets. Our goal is to reduce the nonperforming assets being
mindful of the impact to earnings and capital; however, we may recognize some losses and reductions in the allowance for loan
loss as we expedite the resolution of these problem assets. Delinquencies decreased in the first nine months of 2016 as total
past due loans decreased to $12.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $13.4 million at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $1.2 million,
or 8.64%.  

Other
real estate owned ( OREO ) increased $796 thousand to $13.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $12.4 million at
December 31, 2015. All properties are available for sale by commercial and residential realtors under the direction of our
Special Assets division. During the first nine months of 2016, OREO increased by $3.9 million as a result of settlement of
foreclosed loans, which was offset by sales of $3.1 million of our properties with gains of $290 thousand realized as a
result of the sales. Future sales of these properties are contingent upon an economic recovery; consequently, it is difficult
to estimate the duration of our ownership of these assets. We do have lease agreements on certain other real estate owned
properties which are generating rental income at market rates. Rental income on OREO properties was $182 thousand for the
first nine months of 2016 and 2015. We anticipate liquidating properties that we have had for a long period in the fourth
quarter of 2016, which could result in losses but reduce future carrying costs.  

Our
allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 was $6.4 million, or 1.37% of total loans as compared to $7.5 million, or 1.70%
of total loans at December 31, 2015. Impaired loans decreased $2.4 million, or 13.83%, to $14.9 million with an estimated related
allowance of $719 thousand for potential losses at September 30, 2016 as compared to $17.3 million in impaired loans with an estimated
related allowance of $983 thousand at the end of 2015. No provision for loan losses was recorded during first nine months of 2016,
while a negative provision of $500 thousand was recorded in the second quarter of 2016. In the first nine months of 2016, net
charge offs were $635 thousand, or 0.19% of average loans, as compared to $50 thousand, or 0.01% of average loans, in the same
period of 2015. Included in the net charge offs in 2015 is a recovery of $1.2 million, which was due to the receipt in August
2015 of death benefits on a life insurance policy on which the Bank was the beneficiary. The policy was acquired in 2010 as part
of a settlement with a former borrower on several defaulted loans. As a result of this $1.2 million recovery a negative provision
for loan losses of $1.2 million was made in the third quarter of 2015. The allowance for loan losses is being maintained at a
level that management deems appropriate to absorb any potential future losses and known impairments within the loan portfolio
whether or not the losses are actually ever realized. We continue to adjust the allowance for loan loss model to best reflect
the risks in the portfolio and the improvements made in our internal policies and procedures; however, future provisions may be
deemed necessary.  

Capital
Ratios    

The
Company meets eligibility criteria of a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve Board s Small
Bank Holding Company Policy Statement issued in February 2015, and is no longer obligated to report consolidated regulatory capital.
The Bank continues to be subject to various capital requirements administered by banking agencies.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Bank remains well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. The following
ratios existed at September 30, 2016 for the Bank: Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.00%, Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of 15.72%,
Total risk based capital ratio of 16.98%, and Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 15.72%. The ratios were as follows at December 31,
2015: Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.67%, Tier 1 risk based capital ratio of 16.29%, Total risk based capital ratio of 17.55%, and
Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.29%.  

The
ratios mentioned above for the Bank comply with the Federal Reserve rules to align with the Basel III Capital requirements effective
January 1, 2015. As a result of these new rules the Bank is now subject to a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio set out above.  

Deferred
Tax Asset and Income Taxes   

Due
to timing differences between book and tax treatment of several income and expense items, a net deferred tax asset of $4.8 million
existed at September 30, 2016 as compared to a net deferred tax asset of $5.1 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016
we had a valuation allowance of $5.1 million as compared to a valuation allowance of $5.7 million at December 31, 2015. During
the first nine months of 2016 we reversed $561 thousand of our deferred tax valuation allowance. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company had $16.3 million of net operating loss carryforwards which will expire in 2031 thru 2035. Management expects to utilize
all of these carryforwards prior to expiration. Direct charge-offs contributed to a reduction of the tax asset and are permitted
as tax deductions. In addition, writedowns on other real estate owned property are expensed for book purposes but are not deductible
for tax purposes until disposition of the property. Goodwill expense also was realized for book purposes in 2011 but continues
to only be tax deductible based on the statutory requirements; thus, creating a deferred tax asset. When, and if, taxable income
increases in the future and during the net operating loss carryforward period, this valuation allowance may be reversed and used
to decrease tax obligations in the future. Our income tax expense was computed at the normal corporate income tax rate of 34%
of taxable income included in net income. We do not have significant nontaxable income or nondeductible expenses.  

Capital
Resources   

Our
total capital at the end of the third quarter 2016 was $48.8 million compared to $46.1 million at December 31, 2015. The increase
was $2.7 million, or 5.85%. New Peoples equity as a percentage of total assets was 7.70% at September 30, 2016 compared to 7.36%
at December 31, 2015. The tangible book value per common share was $2.09 at September 30, 2016 compared to $1.97 at December 31,
2015.  

Total
assets increased during the first nine months of 2016 and we anticipate asset levels to increase in the future due to an
emphasis on growing the loan portfolio and the core deposit base of the Bank. Our primary source of capital comes from
earnings. Under current economic conditions, we believe it is prudent to continue to increase capital to support planned
asset growth while being able to absorb potential losses that may occur if asset quality deteriorates further. Based upon
projections, we believe retained earnings will be sufficient to support the Bank s planned asset growth. As part of our
initiative to maintain well capitalized status as defined by regulatory guidelines, we are working to further replace our
nonperforming assets with high-quality interest-earning assets. We are also focused on improving earnings by maintaining a
strong net interest margin and decreasing overhead expenses. However, these efforts alone may not provide us adequate capital
if further losses related to OREO or loans are realized.  

No
cash dividends have been paid historically and we do not anticipate paying a cash dividend in the foreseeable future as the Company
continues to have a retained deficit. Earnings will continue to be retained to build capital and position the Company to pay a
dividend to its shareholders as soon as practicable.  

Liquidity

We
closely monitor our liquidity and our liquid assets which consist of cash, due from banks, federal funds sold, and unpledged available
for sale investments. Collectively, those balances were $95.2 million at September 30, 2016, down from $112.6 million at December
31, 2015. A surplus of short-term assets are maintained at levels management deems adequate to meet potential liquidity needs.  

At
September 30, 2016, all of our investments are classified as available-for-sale. These investments provide an additional source
of liquidity in the amount of $62.8 million, which is net of the $11.8 million of securities pledged as collateral. Investment
securities available for sale serve as a source of liquidity while yielding a higher return versus other short term investment
options, such as federal funds sold and overnight deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank. Due to maturities, paydowns, and sales
of securities to fund loan growth our investment portfolio has declined from $101.6 million at December 31, 2015 to $74.6 million
at September 30, 2016. A $1.2 million increase in the fair market value of the investment portfolio during the first nine months
of 2016 resulted in a net unrealized gain of $673 thousand at September 30, 2016 compared to the net unrealized loss of $496 thousand
at December 31, 2015.  

Available
third-party sources of liquidity at September 30, 2016 include the following: a line of credit with the Federal Home Loan Bank
of Atlanta, access to brokered certificates of deposit markets and internet certificates of deposit, and the discount window at
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. In May 2015, we received notification that a $3.0 million unsecured federal funds line of
credit facility with a correspondent bank had been reinstated. In February 2016, we received notification that this facility had
been increased to $5.0 million. In March 2016, we received notification that another correspondent bank had reinstated an unsecured
federal funds line of credit facility in the amount of $5.0 million. As a result we had the ability to borrow $10.0 million in
unsecured federal funds as of September 30, 2016, which gives us an additional source of liquidity.  

At
September 30, 2016, we had borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) totaling $9.1 million as compared to
$3.0 million at December 31, 2015. None of the FHLB advances are overnight borrowings and therefore none of the advances are subject
to daily interest rate changes. $2.1 million of the borrowings have a maturity date in the year 2018, but are amortizing monthly
or quarterly. These borrowings decreased $900 thousand during the first nine months of 2016 due to regularly scheduled principal
payments. In June 2016 the Bank borrowed an additional $2.0 million with a maturity date in the year 2019 and an additional $5.0
million borrowing with a maturity date in the year 2021. These borrowings were done to take advantage of lower interest rates
to also help fund our loan growth as we work to grow our deposits and loans. We also used our line of credit with the Federal
Home Loan Bank to issue letters of credit for $7.0 million in 2013 and $5.0 million in 2015 to the Treasury Board of Virginia
for collateral on public funds. An additional $123.8 million was available on September 30, 2016 on the $144.8 million line of
credit, which is secured by a blanket lien on our residential real estate loans.  

We have access to the brokered deposits market.
Currently we have $2.7 million in 10-year term time deposits comprised of $3 thousand incremental deposits which yield an interest
rate of 4.10%. With the exception of Certificate of Deposit Registry Service ( CDARS ) time deposits, we have no other
brokered deposits. Though this has not been a strategy in the past, we may utilize this source in the future as a lower cost source
of funds. In February 2016, our ability to participate in CDARS one way buys was reinstated. As of September 30, 2016 we had $1.6
million in CDARS one way buys outstanding. 

We
are a member of an internet certificate of deposit network whereby we may purchase funds from other financial institutions at
auction. We may invest funds through this network as well. Currently, we only intend to use this source of liquidity in a liquidity
crisis event.  

The
Bank has access to additional liquidity through the Federal Reserve Bank discount window for overnight funding needs. We may collateralize
this line with investment securities and loans at our discretion; however, we do not anticipate using this funding source except
as a last resort.  

Additional liquidity is expected to be provided
by loan repayments and core deposit growth that will result from an increase in market share in our targeted trade area. During
the first nine months of 2016, interest rates paid on time deposits were increased in an effort to slow down the trend of declining
time deposit balances. 

With
the increased asset liquidity and other external sources of funding, we believe we have adequate liquidity and capital resources
to meet our requirements and needs for the foreseeable future. However, liquidity can be further affected by a number of factors
such as counterparty willingness or ability to extend credit, regulatory actions and customer preferences, etc.  

The
bank holding company has $967 thousand in cash on deposit at the Bank as of September 30, 2016. These funds will be used to pay
operating expenses, trust preferred interest payments, and provide additional capital injections to the Bank, if needed.  

The
Company is making quarterly interest payments on the trust preferred securities. The restriction requiring regulatory approval
before the payment of interest on the trust preferred securities was lifted when the Written Agreement was terminated effective
January 20, 2016.  

During
the capital raise in 2012, common stock warrants were issued to investors. The warrants are immediately exercisable through December
2017 at a price of $1.75 per share. 175 warrants were exercised during the first nine months of 2016 and the number of warrants
outstanding at September 30, 2016 was 882,178. If these warrants are exercised, additional funds may be received by the Company,
which provides potentially up to $1.5 million in additional liquidity and capital to the holding company. Additional contingent
funding sources will be explored as available.  

Off
Balance Sheet Items and Contractual Obligations   

There
have been no material changes during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 to the off-balance sheet items and the contractual obligations
disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

We
have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our President and
Chief Executive Officer (our  CEO ) and our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (our  CFO ),
of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon
that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were operating effectively in providing
reasonable assurance that (a) the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms, and (b) such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There
were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange
Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the
Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

Part
II Other Information   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

On
June 24, 2015 New Peoples Bank filed an Amended Complaint in the Circuit Court of Russell County Virginia against Arthur Wayne
Bostic, Michael W. Bostic, Sr. and Jeffrey C. Bostic to enforce guarantees of loans made to Bostic Ford Sales, Inc. and seeking
judgment against the guarantors for $1,427,709.76 with interest and legal fees. On July 24, 2015 Arthur Bostic filed a counterclaim
against New Peoples Bank. On March 8, 2016 Michael Bostic, Sr. and Jeffrey Bostic filed their counterclaims against the Bank.
The counterclaims assert lender liability theories of recovery and arise from the refusal of the Bank to continue to extend credit
to Bostic Ford Sales, Inc. in 2008-2009. The defendants seek a judgment against the Bank of at least $3 million.
