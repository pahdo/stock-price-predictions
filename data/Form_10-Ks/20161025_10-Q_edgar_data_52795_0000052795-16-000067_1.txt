  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Basis of presentation:   The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Anixter International Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as "Anixter" or the "Company"), sometimes referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as "we", "our", "us", or "ourselves," have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Therefore, certain information and disclosures normally included in financial statements and related notes prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted. Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to confirm to the current period presentation. The results as discussed in the financial statements reflect continuing operations only, unless otherwise noted. 
    These financial statements should be read in conjunction with, and have been prepared in conformity with, the accounting principles reflected in the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Anixter's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 2016 ("2015 Form 10-K").  The condensed consolidated financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals), which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for the periods shown. 
  The Company maintains its financial records on the basis of a fiscal year ending on the Friday nearest December 31, with the fiscal quarters spanning thirteen weeks, with the first quarter ending on the Friday of the first thirteen-week period. The third quarter of fiscal year 2016 ended on September 30, 2016 and the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 ended on October 2, 2015. 
  Recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements:   In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which makes eight targeted changes to how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The update provides specific guidance on cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by GAAP and thereby reduces the current diversity in practice.  The standard is effective for our financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We adopted ASU 2016-15 as of September 30, 2016 on a retrospective basis for all cash flow statement periods presented.  The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's previously reported cash flows. 
  Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted:    In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which provides guidance for revenue recognition. The update s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance. Examples of the use of judgments and estimates may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The update also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  The update provides for two transition methods to the new guidance: a retrospective approach and a modified retrospective approach.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date  , as a revision to ASU 2014-09, which revised the effective date to fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted but not prior to periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (i.e. the original adoption date per ASU 2014-09).  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations  , which clarifies certain aspects of the principal-versus-agent guidance, including how an entity should identify the unit of accounting for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements, such as service transactions. The amendments also reframe the indicators to focus on evidence that an entity is acting as a principal rather than as an agent. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which clarifies how an entity should evaluate the nature of its promise in granting a license of intellectual property, which will determine whether it recognizes revenue over time or at a point in time. The amendments also clarify when a promised good or service is separately identifiable (i.e., distinct within the context of the contract) and allow entities to disregard items that are immaterial in the context of a contract. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , which amends the new revenue recognition guidance on transition, collectibility, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. The amendments also clarify how an entity should evaluate the collectibility threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard's contract criteria. We are currently evaluating the transition methods and the impact of adoption of these ASUs on our consolidated financial statements.

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which requires lessees to put most leases on their balance sheets but recognize expenses on their income statements and also eliminates the current real estate-specific provisions. The guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases for lessors. The standard is effective for our financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled, allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares than previously allowed for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting, allows a company to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur, and eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them. The new guidance also requires excess tax benefits and tax shortfalls to be presented on the cash flow statement as an operating activity rather than as a financing activity, and clarifies that cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation are to be presented as a financing activity. The standard is effective for our financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses  , which requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable forecasts. The main objective of this ASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.  The standard is effective for our financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  We are currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements. 
  We do not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. 
  Other, net:   The following represents the components of "Other, net" as reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss):   

In the first quarter of 2015, the Venezuelan government changed its policy regarding the bolivar, which required us to use the Sistema Marginal de Divisas or Marginal Exchange System ("SIMADI") a "completely free floating" rate.  In the first nine months of 2015, the Venezuelan bolivar was devalued from approximately   52.0   bolivars to one US dollar ("USD") to approximately   200.0   bolivars to one USD. As a result of this devaluation, we recorded a foreign exchange loss of   $0.7 million   in the nine months ended October 2, 2015.  During the first nine months of 2016, the Venezuelan bolivar was devalued from approximately   200.0   bolivars to one USD to approximately   655.0   bolivars to one USD, which we believe will be the rate available to us in the event we repatriate cash from Venezuela. This devaluation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we have significantly less exposure in Venezuela in 2016.

Several of our subsidiaries conduct business in a currency other than the legal entity s functional currency. Transactions may produce receivables or payables that are fixed in terms of the amount of foreign currency that will be received or paid. A change in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated increases or decreases the expected amount of functional currency cash flows upon settlement of the transaction.  The increase or decrease in expected functional currency cash flows is a foreign currency transaction gain or loss that is included in "Other, net" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). 
  We purchase foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currency-denominated accounts on our reported income. The foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. Our strategy is to negotiate terms for our derivatives and other financial instruments to be highly effective, such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item (e.g., various foreign currency-denominated accounts). Our counterparties to foreign currency forward contracts have investment-grade credit ratings. We expect the creditworthiness of our counterparties to remain intact through the term of the transactions. We regularly monitor the creditworthiness of our counterparties to ensure no issues exist which could affect the value of the derivatives.   
  We do not hedge   100%   of our foreign currency-denominated accounts. In addition, the results of hedging can vary significantly based on various factors, such as the timing of executing the foreign currency forward contracts versus the movement of the currencies as well as the fluctuations in the account balances throughout each reporting period. The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on the difference between the contract rate and the current exchange rate. The fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts is measured using observable market information. These inputs would be considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. At   September 30, 2016   and   January 1, 2016  , foreign currency forward contracts were revalued at then-current foreign exchange rates with the changes in valuation reflected directly in "Other, net" in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) offsetting the transaction gain/loss recorded on the foreign currency-denominated accounts. At   September 30, 2016   and   January 1, 2016  , the gross notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was approximately   $122.1 million   and   $196.1 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   January 1, 2016  , the net notional amount of the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding was approximately   $99.5 million   and   $132.8 million  , respectively.  While all of our foreign currency forward contracts are subject to master netting arrangements with our counterparties, we present our assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments on a gross basis within the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The gross fair value of our derivative assets and liabilities are immaterial.   
  The combined effect of changes in both the equity and bond markets resulted in changes in the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance policies associated with our sponsored deferred compensation program.  
  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss):   We accumulate unrealized gains and losses in "Accumulated other comprehensive loss" ("AOCI").  These changes are also reported in "Other comprehensive income (loss)" on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).  These include unrealized gains and losses related to our defined benefit obligations, certain immaterial derivative transactions that have been designated as cash flow hedges and foreign currency translation.  See   Note 8. "Pension Plans"   for pension related amounts reclassified into net income.  
  Our investments in several subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the USD. As these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at the end of each period during consolidation using period-end exchange rates, fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the USD increase or decrease the value of those investments. These fluctuations and the results of operations for foreign subsidiaries, where the functional currency is not the USD, are translated into USD using the average exchange rates during the periods reported, while the assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates. The assets and liabilities-related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of AOCI, "Foreign currency translation." In addition, as our subsidiaries maintain investments denominated in currencies other than local currencies, exchange rate fluctuations will occur.  Borrowings are raised in certain foreign currencies to minimize the exchange rate translation adjustment risk.

NOTE 2.     DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS    
       
  On February 9, 2015, our Board of Directors approved the disposition of the OEM Supply - Fasteners ("Fasteners") business.  On February 11, 2015, through our wholly-owned subsidiary Anixter Inc., we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with American Industrial Partners ("AIP") to sell the Fasteners business for   $380.0 million   in cash, subject to certain post-closing adjustments.  We closed the sale of the Fasteners business to AIP, excluding certain foreign locations, on June 1, 2015 and settled all net working capital adjustments relating to these entities in the fourth quarter of 2015. We received cash of   $371.8 million   on the sale of the Fasteners business.  Including transaction related costs of   $16.4 million  , the sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of   $40.3 million   (  $23.3 million  , net of tax).  
    
  The assets and liabilities and operating results of the Fasteners business are presented as "discontinued operations" in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  Current assets of discontinued operations are presented within "Other current assets" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Current and long-term liabilities of discontinued operations are presented within "Accrued Expenses" and "Other liabilities," respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The components of the results from discontinued operations reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows were immaterial.   
    
  We allocated interest costs to discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the Fasteners business.  There was   no   allocated interest cost in 2016 or the three months ended October 2, 2015. The allocated interest cost was   $1.1 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  . This represents the amount of interest costs not directly attributable to our other operations that would not have been incurred if we had the proceeds from the sale of the Fasteners business at the beginning of the period. 
    
  The following represents the components of the results from discontinued operations as reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss):  

As reflected on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   January 1, 2016  , the components of assets and liabilities of the Fasteners businesses classified as "discontinued operations" are as follows:

NOTE 3.     BUSINESS COMBINATION    
  On October 5, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the Power Solutions business ("Power Solutions") from HD Supply, Inc. in exchange for   $829.4 million   (net of cash and outstanding checks of   $11.7 million  ).  The acquisition was financed using borrowings under new financing arrangements and cash on hand. 
  Power Solutions was a compelling strategic acquisition for us that significantly enhances our competitive position in the electrical wire and cable business and further strengthens our customer and supplier value proposition. In addition to transforming our existing utility business into a leading North American distributor to the utility sector, this acquisition enables us to provide a full line electrical solution to our existing customers and provides us with broader access to the mid-size electrical construction market.  The high voltage business of Power Solutions forms the Utility Power Solutions ("UPS") segment within our realigned reportable segments.  The low voltage business of Power Solutions was combined into our historical Electrical and Electronic Wire and Cable ("W C") segment to form the Electrical   Electronic Solutions ("EES") segment. 
  The following table sets forth the purchase price allocation, as of the acquisition date, for Power Solutions. The purchase price allocation, including the valuation of the acquired leases, intangible assets and related deferred tax liabilities was completed in the third quarter of 2016.  

Power Solutions goodwill of   $35.4 million   and   $159.6 million   was recorded in the EES and UPS reportable segments, respectively.  The goodwill resulting from the acquisition largely consists of our expected future product sales and synergies from combining Power Solutions products with our existing product offerings.  Other than   $81.1 million  , the remaining goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.  The following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired and their estimated useful lives as of the date of the acquisition:  

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Power Solutions acquisition added   $497.0 million   of revenue and   $15.7 million   in operating income to our consolidated results. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Power Solutions acquisition added   $1,501.9 million   of revenue and   $43.3 million   in operating income to our consolidated results.  Since the date of acquisition, the Power Solutions results are reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

The following unaudited pro forma information shows our results of operations as if the acquisition of Power Solutions had been completed as of the beginning of fiscal 2015.  Adjustments have been made for the pro forma effects of interest expense and deferred financing costs related to the financing for the acquisition, depreciation and amortization of tangible and intangible assets recognized as part of the business combinations, related income taxes and various other costs which would not have been incurred had we and Power Solutions operated as a combined entity. 

NOTE 4.      RESTRUCTURING CHARGES    
  We consider restructuring activities to be programs whereby we fundamentally change our operations, such as closing and consolidating facilities, reducing headcount and realigning operations in response to changing market conditions.  The following table summarizes activity related to liabilities associated with our restructuring activities:   

(a) 
    Employee-related costs primarily consist of severance benefits provided to employees who have been involuntarily terminated. 
              (b) 
    Facility exit and other costs primarily consist of lease termination costs.  
     Q2 2016 Restructuring Plan 
  In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded a pre-tax charge of   $2.1 million  ,   $1.4 million  , and   $2.2 million   in our NSS, EES, and UPS segments, respectively, and an additional   $0.1 million   at our corporate headquarters, primarily for severance-related expenses associated with a reduction of approximately   150   positions.  The   $5.8 million   charge primarily reflects actions we are taking to improve efficiencies in our Canada and Latin America regions.  This charge was included in "Operating expenses" in our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the second quarter of 2016.  The majority of the remaining charge included in accrued expenses of   $4.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   is expected to be paid by the second quarter of 2017.    
  Q4 2015 Restructuring Plan  
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a pre-tax charge of   $1.0 million  ,   $2.3 million   and   $0.1 million   in our NSS, EES, and UPS segments, respectively, primarily for severance-related expenses associated with a reduction of approximately   80   positions.  The   $3.4 million   charge primarily reflects actions we are taking to improve efficiencies in conjunction with the acquisition of Power Solutions.  This charge was included in "Operating expenses" in our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal year 2015.  The majority of the remaining charge included in accrued expenses of   $1.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   is expected to be paid by the second quarter of 2017.

Q2 2015 Restructuring Plan 
  In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a pre-tax charge of   $3.0 million   and   $2.2 million   in our NSS and EES segments, respectively, and an additional    $0.1 million   at our corporate headquarters for severance-related expenses associated with a reduction of approximately   100   positions.  The   $5.3 million   charge reflects actions we took to improve efficiencies and eliminate the stranded costs in conjunction with the sale of the Fasteners business.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we reduced the charge by   $0.5 million  , primarily in our EES segment, due to a reduction in estimated future obligations under the plan. This charge was included in "Operating expenses" in our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for fiscal year 2015.  The majority of the remaining charge included in accrued expenses of   $0.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   is expected to be paid by the fourth quarter of 2016.  
  Q4 2012 Restructuring Plan 
  In the fourth quarter of 2012, recognizing the ongoing challenging global economic conditions, we took aggressive actions to restructure our costs across all segments and geographies, resulting in a pre-tax charge of   $4.1 million   and   $2.8 million   in our NSS and EES segments, respectively.  The   $6.9 million   restructuring charge primarily consisted of severance-related expenses associated with a reduction of over   200   positions.  This charge was included in "Operating expenses" in our Consolidated Statement of Income for fiscal year 2012.  At   September 30, 2016  , the majority of the remaining charge included in accrued expenses of   $0.3 million   is expected to be paid by the fourth quarter of 2016.  

NOTE 5.      DEBT     
  Debt is summarized below: 

Retirement of Debt 
  In the first quarter of 2015, we retired our   5.95%   Senior notes due 2015 upon maturity for   $200.0 million  .  Available borrowings under existing long-term financing agreements were used to settle the maturity value.  
  Fair Value of Debt 
  The fair value of our debt instruments is measured using observable market information which would be considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in accounting guidance on fair value measurements. Our fixed-rate debt consists of the Senior notes due 2023, Senior notes due 2021 and Senior notes due 2019. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our total carrying value and estimated fair value of debt outstanding was   $1,428.5 million   and   $1,496.4 million  , respectively. This compares to a carrying value and estimated fair value of debt outstanding at   January 1, 2016   of   $1,642.9 million   and   $1,669.5 million  , respectively. The decrease in the carrying value and estimated fair value is primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings under our revolving lines of credit and partial repayment of our Canadian term loan.

NOTE 6.      LEGAL CONTINGENCIES         
  From time to time, we are party to legal proceedings and matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. As of   September 30, 2016  , we do not believe there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these proceedings and matters has been incurred. However, the ultimate resolutions of these proceedings and matters are inherently unpredictable. As such, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings or matters. 

NOTE 7.      INCOME TAXES    
  Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the   third   quarter of 2016 was   38.4%  , which included a   $2.1 million   net tax benefit related to prior year tax positions, compared to   37.8%   in the prior year quarter.  Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   39.3%   compared to   37.5%   in the prior year period. Year over year, the increase was attributable to a change in the country mix of earnings, offset by a   $2.1 million   net tax benefit from prior year tax positions.  
  As of January 2, 2015, we asserted permanent reinvestment of all non-U.S. earnings, including the non-U.S. earnings of the Fasteners business.  As a result of our Board of Directors  approval of the disposition of the Fasteners business during February 2015, we were no longer permanently reinvested with respect to the non-U.S. earnings of the Fasteners business, because, following the disposition, we intended to repatriate to the U.S. most of the net proceeds attributable to the sale of the non-U.S. Fasteners business via intercompany debt repayment, dividend or other means.  During the second quarter of 2015, we refined the anticipated repatriation amount and the estimated tax impact of the change in the reinvestment assertion, and we reduced the first quarter estimate by   $4.9 million  .  Therefore, our nine months ended October 2, 2015 results included, as a component of discontinued operations,   $10.3 million   of expense for U.S. federal and state, and foreign income taxes and withholding taxes related to this change in our reinvestment assertion.  We consider the remaining undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, along with future earnings, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes or any withholding taxes has been recorded. 

NOTE 8.      PENSION PLANS    
  Our defined benefit pension plans are the plans in the United States, which consist of the Anixter Inc. Pension Plan, the Executive Benefit Plan and the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ("SERP") (together the "Domestic Plans") and various defined benefit pension plans covering employees of foreign subsidiaries in Canada and Europe (together the "Foreign Plans"). The majority of our defined benefit pension plans are non-contributory and cover substantially all full-time domestic employees and certain employees in other countries. Retirement benefits are provided based on compensation as defined in both the Domestic Plans and the Foreign Plans. Our policy is to fund all Domestic Plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA") and the IRS and all Foreign Plans as required by applicable foreign laws. The Executive Benefit Plan and SERP are the only two plans that are unfunded. Assets in the various plans consist primarily of equity securities and fixed income investments. 
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we commenced settlement of the liabilities of one of our Europe pension plans. At that time, we entered into a buy-in policy with an insurance carrier for that plan. In the second quarter of 2016, we terminated the buy-in policy and entered into an agreement for issuance of a buy-out policy and settled the pension obligation. Accumulated other comprehensive losses of approximately   $9.6 million   (   6.9 million  ) were realized as a result of the settlement and are reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).

NOTE 9.      STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY    
  At the end of the   third   quarter of 2016, there were   1.2 million   shares reserved for issuance under all incentive plans. Under the current stock incentive plans, we pay non-employee directors annual retainer fees, a portion of which are in the form of stock units. Employee and director stock units are included in common stock outstanding on the date of vesting, and stock options are included in common stock outstanding upon exercise by the participant. The fair value of employee stock options and units is amortized over the respective vesting period representing the requisite service period, generally   three  ,   four   or   six   years for stock units and   four   years for stock options. Director stock units are expensed in the period in which they are granted, as these vest immediately. 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we initiated a performance-based restricted stock unit ("performance units") program that will vest in one-third tranches to be evaluated on the anniversary of the first, second and third performance cycles.  Each evaluation period will be based on the achievement of our total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to the TSR of the S P Mid Cap 400 index.  The issuance of the vested shares will be on the final vesting date of year three.  The granted units will be adjusted based on the specific payout percentage of the grant agreement.  The fair value of each tranche related to the performance units were estimated at the grant date using the Monte Carlo Simulation pricing model. 
  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we did not grant stock units or performance units to employees.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we granted    405,628   stock units to employees with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of   $17.8 million  .  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we granted   85,839   performance units to employees with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of    $1.8 million  .  During the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we did not grant stock units to our directors.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we granted directors   23,167   stock units, with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of    $1.2 million  . We exclude antidilutive stock options and units from the calculation of weighted-average shares for diluted earnings per share.  For the   third   quarter of 2016 and 2015, the antidilutive stock options and units were immaterial.

NOTE 10.     BUSINESS SEGMENTS     
  We are a leading distributor of enterprise cabling and security solutions, electrical and electronic wire and cable products and utility power solutions.  We have identified Network   Security Solutions ("NSS"), Electrical and Electronic Solutions ("EES") and Utility Power Solutions ("UPS") as reportable segments.   
  We incur corporate expenses to obtain and coordinate financing, tax, information technology, legal and other related services, certain of which were rebilled to subsidiaries.  These corporate expenses were historically allocated to our business segments based primarily on projected sales and estimated use of time.  A portion of these corporate expenses were reported in corporate as they historically had been allocated to the Fasteners segment but were not considered directly related to the discontinued operations. Beginning in the first quarter of 2016, we no longer allocate corporate expenses to our business segments.  We also have various corporate assets which are reported in corporate. Segment assets may not include jointly used assets, but segment results include depreciation expense or other allocations related to those assets as such allocation is made for internal reporting. Interest expense and other non-operating items are not allocated to the segments or reviewed on a segment basis, except as previously discussed in Note 2. "Discontinued Operations."   
  The categorization of net sales by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristic of the product, the "sold to" customer information, the "ship to" customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated. We also have largely specialized our sales organization by segment.  As data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve, the categorization of products by end market can vary over time. When this occurs, we reclassify net sales by end market for prior periods. Such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of, or the underlying trends of results within, each end market.  
  Segment Financial Information   
  Segment information for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015   are as follows:   

Net sales and operating income in our UPS segment for the nine months ended October 2, 2015 were previously reported in our EES segment.

Goodwill Assigned to Segments  
  The following table presents the changes in goodwill allocated to our reporting units during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  :    

(a) 
    In the first, second and third quarters of 2016, we recorded an immaterial increase in goodwill primarily related to determining the fair value of inventory and fixed assets relating to the Power Solutions acquisition. 
     We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually at the beginning of the third quarter and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of these assets might exceed their current fair values. We assess goodwill for impairment by first performing a qualitative assessment, which considers specific factors, based on the weight of evidence, and the significance of all identified events and circumstances in the context of determining whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount.  If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using the qualitative assessment, we perform the two-step impairment test.  From time to time, we may also bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the two-step impairment test.  The first step of the impairment test is to identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. The estimates of fair value of a reporting unit are determined using the income approach and/or the market approach as described below. If step one of the test indicates a carrying value above the estimated fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. The implied residual value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination.  
  As a result of the reclassification of net sales of various product categories between our segments during the first half of 2016, we reassigned the carrying amount of goodwill based on the relative fair value of our reporting units.  We then performed the quantitative two-step impairment test of goodwill for all reporting units before and after the change in composition of our segments utilizing a combination of the income and market approaches, both of which are broadly defined below.  We concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed and the carrying amount of goodwill to be fully recoverable. 
  In connection with our annual assessment of goodwill at the beginning of the third quarter of 2016, we bypassed the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative test for all reporting units and utilized a combination of the income and market approaches, both of which are broadly defined below.  As a result of this assessment, we concluded that no impairment existed and the carrying amount of goodwill to be fully recoverable. 
  The income approach is a quantitative evaluation to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the income approach we determine the fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital plus a forecast risk, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return a market participant would expect to earn. The inputs used for the income approach were significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as described in the accounting fair value hierarchy. Estimated future cash flows were based on our internal projection models, industry projections and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. 
  The market approach measures the fair value of a reporting unit through the analysis of recent sales, offerings, and financial multiples (sales or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA")) of comparable businesses. Consideration is given to the financial conditions and operating performance of the reporting unit being valued relative to those publicly-traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business. 
  Although all of our reporting units have fair values that currently exceed the underlying carrying values, the margin of fair value over carrying value of our NSS and UPS reporting units were greater than   10%  , while the fair value of our EES reporting unit was approximately   1%   greater than its carrying value  due to the combined effects of the weaker industrial economy and lower commodity prices on a year over year basis. As a result, this unit is more susceptible to impairment risk from further adverse macroeconomic conditions. Any such adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that could trigger future impairment charges relating to the EES reporting unit.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 
  The following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, set forth in this report under "Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements" and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 1, 2016. 
  Third   Quarter and Year-to-Date 2016 and 2015 Consolidated Results of Operations 

Executive Overview 
  Third   Quarter Highlights 
  Reflecting the continued underlying strength in our network infrastructure business, we delivered sales growth of 0.3% and organic sales growth of   0.7%   in our Network and Security Solutions ("NSS") segment, driven by sales growth in our North America geography.  In our Electrical and Electronic Solutions ("EES") and Utility Power Solutions ("UPS") segments, the combined effects of the weaker industrial economy and lower commodity prices on a year-over-year basis continue to be headwinds.  
    
  Additional highlights of the quarter included: 
    
     Record   third   quarter sales of   $1,956.3 million  , up   31.4%  , driven by the Power Solutions acquisition; 
     Generated   $238.4 million   in cash from operations in the first nine months of 2016, further improving liquidity. 
  Strategy Update and Business Outlook 
  Our NSS segment continues to experience positive momentum in all regions except Central and Latin America ("CALA"), driven by strength in projects with global customers.  While our EES segment continues to experience weakness related to industrial and manufacturing end market exposure, recent daily sales trends are improving in all regions except CALA.  Our UPS segment continues to experience soft trends related to its exposure to oil and gas end markets in the US and Canada, combined with the timing impact of major capital projects for investor-owned utilities.  Reflecting on the diverging trends across our business and across the broad economy, we remain cautious regarding prospects for a recovery in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Items Impacting Comparability of Results 
  In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") above, this report includes certain financial measures computed using non-GAAP components as defined by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Specifically, net sales comparisons to the prior corresponding period, both worldwide and in relevant segments, are discussed in this report both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. We believe that by providing non-GAAP organic growth, which adjusts for the impact of acquisitions (when applicable), foreign exchange fluctuations, copper prices and the number of billing days, both management and investors are provided with meaningful supplemental sales information to understand and analyze our underlying trends and other aspects of our financial performance. We calculate the year over year organic sales growth and operating expenses impact relating to the Power Solutions acquisition by including its 2015 comparable period results prior to the acquisition with our results (on a "pro forma" basis) as we believe this represents the most accurate representation of organic growth, considering the nature of the company we acquired and the synergistic revenues that have been or will be achieved.  Historically and from time to time, we may also exclude other items from reported financial results (e.g., impairment charges, inventory adjustments, restructuring charges, tax items, currency devaluations, pension settlements, etc.) in presenting adjusted operating expense, adjusted operating income, adjusted income taxes and adjusted net income so that both management and financial statement users can use these non-GAAP financial measures to better understand and evaluate our performance period over period and to analyze the underlying trends of our business.  As a result of the recent acquisitions, we have also excluded amortization of intangible assets associated with purchase accounting from acquisitions from the adjusted amounts for comparison of the non-GAAP financial measures period over period. 
  EBITDA is defined as net income from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA before foreign exchange and other non-operating expense and non-cash stock-based compensation, excluding the other items from reported financial results, as defined above. We believe that adjusted operating income, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide relevant and useful information, which is widely used by analysts, investors and competitors in our industry as well as by our management in assessing both consolidated and business segment performance.  Adjusted operating income provides an understanding of the results from the primary operations of our business by excluding the effects of certain items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations.  We use adjusted operating income to evaluate our period over period operating performance because we believe this provides a more comparable measure of our continuing business excluding certain items that are not reflective of  expected ongoing operations.  This measure may be useful to an investor in evaluating the underlying performance of our business. EBITDA provides us with an understanding of earnings before the impact of investing and financing charges and income taxes.  Adjusted EBITDA further excludes the effects of foreign exchange and other non-cash stock-based compensation, and certain items that do not reflect the ordinary earnings of our operations and that are also excluded for purposes of calculating adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share and adjusted operating income.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are used by our management for various purposes including as measures of performance of our operating entities and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting. Adjusted EBITDA may be useful to an investor because this measure is widely used to evaluate a company s operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending on the accounting methods, book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which the assets were acquired, among other factors.  They are not, however, intended as an alternative measure of operating results or cash flow from operations as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  
  Non-GAAP financial measures provide insight into selected financial information and should be evaluated in the context in which they are presented. These non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information presented in compliance with GAAP, and non-GAAP financial measures as reported by us may not be comparable to similarly titled amounts reported by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, including the related notes, and Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this report. Management does not use these non-GAAP financial measures for any purpose other than the reasons stated above. 
  Our operating results can be affected by changes in prices of commodities, primarily copper, which are components in some of the electrical wire and cable products sold. Generally, as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices, our mark-up percentage to customers remains relatively constant, resulting in higher sales revenue and gross profit. In addition, existing inventory purchased at previously lower prices and sold as prices increase may result in a higher gross profit margin. Conversely, a decrease in commodity prices in a short period of time would have the opposite effect, negatively affecting financial results. The degree to which spot market copper prices change affects product prices and the amount of gross profit earned will be affected by end market demand and overall economic conditions. Importantly, however, there is no exact measure of the impact of changes in copper prices, as there are thousands of transactions in any given year, each of which has various factors involved in the individual pricing decisions. Therefore, all references to the effect of copper prices are estimates.

In 2016, we changed the composition of our reportable segments and we no longer allocate certain corporate costs. Accordingly, prior period segment financial information has been revised to reflect these changes.   
  In the third quarter of 2016, we recorded   $9.4 million   of intangible asset amortization expense,   $0.7 million   of acquisition and integration costs, and a restructuring charge reversal of   $0.2 million  .  In the second quarter of 2016, we recorded $9.5 million of intangible asset amortization expense, $9.6 million related to a settlement of pension obligations in the UK, $7.6 million of Latin America bad debt provision, $5.6 million of restructuring costs, and $1.4 million of acquisition and integration costs.  In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded $9.7 million of intangible asset amortization expense and $2.2 million of acquisition and integration costs. 
  In the third quarter of 2015, we recorded   $5.0 million   of intangible asset amortization expense and acquisition and integration costs of   $8.1 million  .  In the second quarter of 2015, we recorded $5.2 million of intangible asset amortization expense, $5.3 million of restructuring costs, a $3.1 million write-off of capitalized software that has no ongoing economic benefit to continuing operations, $2.6 million of Latin America bad debt provision, a $1.7 million dilapidation provision related to our leasehold properties, acquisition and integration costs of $1.0 million, and $0.4 million related to the pension obligations in the UK.  In the first quarter of 2015, we recorded $5.1 million of intangible asset amortization expense and $0.7 million of foreign exchange losses due to the devaluation of the Venezuela bolivar.

  The Power Solutions acquisition was accounted for as a purchase and its results of operations are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of the acquisition (October 5, 2015).  Had the acquisition of Power Solutions been completed as of the beginning of fiscal 2015, our pro forma net sales, net income from continuing operations and diluted income per share from continuing operations would have been the following as compared to our reported results. 

Excluding the unfavorable impact of items impacting net income from continuing operations of   $8.2 million   and   $23.9 million   in the three and   nine months ended October 2, 2015  , respectively, as described above, the pro forma diluted earnings per share from continuing operations would have been the following as compared to our non-GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations.

Net Sales 

*   Revised due to change in composition of our reportable segments. 
  NSS     Sales of   $1,049.9 million   increased   0.3%   from   $1,046.9 million   in the prior year period. NSS organic sales increased   0.7%  , adjusting for the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, reflecting growth in our North America geography, driven by global accounts and projects with multi-national companies, partially offset by macro-economic challenges in our Latin America region combined with non-recurring projects in Brazil and Asia in the prior year quarter. In addition, NSS sales were higher due to the growth of security product sales in the   third   quarter of 2016 of   $417.7 million  , which represents   39.8%   of total segment sales, increased   2.6%   from the prior year quarter.  Adjusted for the   $1.9 million   negative currency impact, organic security sales growth was   3.1%   compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
  EES     Sales of   $535.1 million   increased   26.3%   from   $423.6 million   in the prior year period due to the low voltage business of the Power Solutions acquisition, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts from copper and foreign exchange. EES organic sales decreased by   3.1%  , reflecting weak trends with industrial customers along with weakness in Latin America. 
  UPS         Sales were   $371.3 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016, a decrease of   8.8%   on an organic basis. During the   third   quarter of 2016, sales in this segment continue to be negatively impacted by lower sales in Canada due to weakness in oil and gas regions along with the timing of utility customers' major project spend.

NSS security sales in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $1,211.3 million  , which represents   39.8%   of total segment sales, increased   0.9%   from the prior year period.  Adjusted for the   $17.1 million   negative currency impact, organic security sales growth was   2.4%   compared to the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  . 
  EES     Sales of   $1,596.2 million   increased   21.5%   from   $1,313.9 million   in the prior year period due to the low voltage business of the Power Solutions acquisition, partially offset by the unfavorable impacts from copper and foreign exchange. EES organic sales decreased by   4.0%  , with declines across all of our geographies, reflecting weakness with industrial customers and relatively flat performance with OEM customers, along with the weakness in Latin America. 
  UPS         Sales were   $1,088.3 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   6.4%   on an organic basis.  
  Gross Margin 
  Gross margin of   20.3%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compares to   22.2%   in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Gross margin of   20.3%   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compares to   22.3%   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  . As expected, the decrease is primarily due to the lower margin sales attributed to the Power Solutions acquisition.

Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses were   $309.4 million   and   $252.7 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The   third   quarter of 2016 includes   $9.4 million   of intangible asset amortization expense,   $0.7 million   of acquisition and integration costs, and a restructuring charge reversal of   $0.2 million  .  The   third   quarter of 2015 includes   $5.0 million   of intangible asset amortization expense and acquisition and integration costs of   $8.1 million  .  Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses in the third quarter of 2016 of   $299.5 million  , or   15.3%   of sales, compares to prior year adjusted operating expense of   $239.6 million  , or   16.1%   of sales.  Further adjusting operating expenses for a favorable   $2.3 million   impact of foreign currency in the   third   quarter of 2016, and including   $68.5 million   of pro forma Power Solutions expenses in the prior year quarter, adjusted operating expenses would have decreased by   2.0%  . 
  Operating expenses were   $956.6 million   and   $767.1 million   in the   nine months ended   2016 and 2015, respectively.  The   nine months ended   2016 includes   $28.6 million   of intangible asset amortization expense,   $9.6 million   related to the UK pension pension settlement,   $5.4 million   of restructuring costs,   $7.6 million   of Latin America bad debt provision and   $4.3 million   of acquisition and integration costs.  The   nine months ended   2015 includes   $15.3 million   of intangible asset amortization expense, acquisition and integration costs of   $9.1 million  ,    $5.3 million   of restructuring costs, a   $3.1 million   write-off of capitalized software that has no ongoing economic benefit to continuing operations,   $2.6 million   of Latin America bad debt provision, a   $1.7 million   dilapidation provision related to our leasehold properties, and   $0.4 million   related to the pension obligations in the UK.  Excluding these items, adjusted operating expenses in 2016 of   $901.1 million  , or   15.7%   of sales, compares to prior year adjusted operating expense of   $729.6 million  , or   16.8%   of sales.  Further adjusting operating expenses for a favorable   $11.3 million   impact of foreign currency in the   nine months ended   2016, and including   $190.5 million   of pro forma Power Solutions expenses in the prior year, adjusted operating expenses would have decreased by   0.8%  .

NSS     Operating income was   $74.9 million  , or   7.1%   of sales, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $74.1 million  , or   7.1%   of sales, in the   third   quarter of 2015.  The increase in operating income was primarily due to an increase in net sales, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.  NSS delivered adjusted operating income of   $78.1 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016, resulting in adjusted operating margin of   7.4%  . NSS delivered adjusted operating income of   $77.8 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015, resulting in adjusted operating margin of   7.4%  .  
    
  EES     Operating income was   $28.7 million  , or   5.4%   of sales, in the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   $32.5 million  , or   7.7%   of sales, in the   third   quarter of   2015  . The decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to an unfavorable change in product mix, including net sales to industrial customers, partially offset by operating income contributed by the low voltage business of the Power Solutions acquisition. EES delivered adjusted operating income of   $30.7 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016, resulting in adjusted operating margin of   5.7%  .  EES delivered adjusted operating income of   $33.8 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015, resulting in adjusted operating margin of   8.0%  .

EES     Operating income was   $75.1 million  , or   4.7%   of sales, in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $101.9 million  , or   7.8%   of sales, in the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  .  The decrease in operating income is primarily attributable to negative copper prices, currency impact and weaker demand in oil and gas as well as the broader industries, partially offset by operating income contributed by the low voltage business of the Power Solutions acquisition.  EES delivered adjusted operating income of   $86.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , resulting in adjusted operating margin of   5.4%  .  EES delivered adjusted operating income of   $107.9 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  , resulting in adjusted operating margin of   8.2%  .  
    
  UPS     Operating income was   $42.1 million  , or   3.9%   of sales, with adjusted operating income of   $56.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Interest Expense and Other 
  Interest expense was   $19.8 million   and   $15.8 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Interest expense was   $59.7 million   and   $42.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015  , respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2016 results from the issuance of incremental debt used to finance the Power Solutions acquisition, partially offset by the repayment of the 5.95% Senior notes due 2015 in the first quarter of 2015. 
  Foreign exchange and other expense of   $2.1 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 compares to   $5.5 million   in the   third   quarter of 2015. Foreign exchange and other expense of   $5.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compares to   $13.0 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  .  
  We recorded foreign exchange losses of   $3.5 million   and   $4.5 million   in the   third   quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We recorded foreign exchange losses of   $8.0 million   and    $10.5 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015, respectively.  In the first quarter of 2015, the Venezuelan government changed its policy regarding the bolivar, which required us to use the Sistema Marginal de Divisas or Marginal Exchange System ("SIMADI") a "completely free floating" rate.  In the first nine months of 2015, the Venezuelan bolivar was devalued from approximately   52.0   bolivars to one USD to approximately   200.0   bolivars to one USD. As a result of this devaluation, we recorded an additional foreign exchange loss of   $0.7 million   in the nine months ended October 2, 2015.  During the first nine months of 2016, the Venezuelan bolivar was devalued from approximately   200.0   bolivars to one USD to approximately   655.0   bolivars to one USD, which we believe will be the rate available to us in the event we repatriate cash from Venezuela. This devaluation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we have significantly less exposure in Venezuela in 2016. 
  The combined effect of changes in both the equity and bond markets resulted in changes in the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance policies associated with our sponsored deferred compensation program. We recorded   $0.5 million   of gains and   $0.5 million   of losses on the cash surrender value of life insurance policies in the   third   quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recorded   $1.7 million   of gains on the cash surrender value of life insurance policies in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and losses of   $0.5 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  . 
  Income Taxes 
  Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the   third   quarter of 2016 was   38.4%  , which included a $2.1 million net tax benefit related to prior year tax positions, compared to   37.8%   in the prior year quarter.  Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   39.3%   compared to   37.5%   in the prior year period. Year over year, the increase was attributable to the change in the country mix of earnings since many of the current year operating expense charges of   $55.5 million   in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were incurred in countries with low income tax rates or have valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets offset by the $2.1 million net tax benefit from prior year tax positions.  Excluding the net tax benefit, our projected full year effective tax rate is 40.8%. 
  As of January 2, 2015, we asserted permanent reinvestment of all non-U.S. earnings, including the non-U.S. earnings of the Fasteners business.  As a result of the disposition of the Fasteners business during February 2015, we were no longer permanently reinvested with respect to the non-U.S. earnings of the Fasteners business, because we repatriated to the U.S. most of the net proceeds attributable to the sale of the non-U.S. Fasteners business via intercompany debt repayment, dividend or other means.  During the second quarter of 2015, we refined the anticipated repatriation amount and the estimated tax impact of the change in the reinvestment assertion, and we reduced the first quarter estimate by   $4.9 million  .  Therefore, our   nine months ended October 2, 2015   results included, as a component of discontinued operations,   $10.3 million   of expense for U.S. federal and state, and foreign income taxes and withholding taxes related to this change in our reinvestment assertion.  We consider the remaining undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, along with future earnings, to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes or any withholding taxes has been recorded.

The corresponding Adjusted EBITDA margin of   5.9%   compares to   8.1%   in the prior year quarter. Approximately two-thirds of the decline in Adjusted EBITDA margin was caused by lower copper pricing and weakness in the industrial sector, with the balance due to the acquisition of the low voltage Power Solutions business. 
    
  UPS     UPS Adjusted EBITDA in the   third   quarter of 2016 was   $21.1 million  , or   5.7%   of sales.

The following table represents the components of the results from discontinued operations as reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  . There was no material activity related to discontinued operations reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

Financial Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash Flow 
  As a distributor, our use of capital is largely for working capital to support our revenue growth. Capital commitments for property and equipment are limited to information technology assets, warehouse equipment, office furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements, since we operate almost entirely from leased facilities. Therefore, in any given reporting period, the amount of cash consumed or generated by operations other than from net earnings will primarily be due to changes in working capital as a result of the rate of increases or decreases in sales. 
    
  In periods when sales are increasing, the expanded working capital needs will be funded first by cash from operations, then from additional borrowings and lastly from additional equity offerings. In periods when sales are decreasing, we will have improved cash flows due to reduced working capital requirements. During such periods, we will use the expanded cash flow to reduce the amount of leverage in our capital structure until such time as economic conditions improve and growth resumes. Also, we will, from time to time, issue or retire borrowings or equity in an effort to maintain a cost-effective capital structure consistent with our anticipated capital requirements. 
  Net cash provided by operations was   $238.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   versus   $93.7 million   in the prior year period. The increase reflects an improvement in working capital efficiencies.   
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $29.6 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily related to capital expenditures.  This compares to net cash provided by investing activities of   $354.0 million   in the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  , which included   $381.0 million   of initial cash proceeds from the sale of the Fasteners business, partially offset by   $29.2 million   for capital expenditures.  Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $35 - $40 million in 2016 as we continue to invest in warehouse equipment, information system upgrades and integration of acquired businesses, and new software to support our infrastructure. 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $227.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $77.4 million   provided in the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  .  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had net repayments from our revolving lines of credit of   $169.0 million   and a repayment of our Canadian term loan of   $58.5 million  .  During the   nine months ended October 2, 2015  , we received net proceeds of $345.6 million from the issuance of the Notes due 2023.  We also repaid our Senior notes due 2015 at a maturity value of   $200.0 million   and repaid $63.9 million from our revolving lines of credit.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our primary liquidity source was the Receivables Facility in an aggregate committed amount of $600.0 million and the Inventory Facility in an aggregate committed amount of $150.0 million.  At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $221.0 million   of borrowings under the Receivables Facility, and there were no borrowings under the Inventory Facility. 
  We continue to have a strong focus on improving our margin, cost structure and working capital efficiency. Our capital allocation priorities include achieving our debt-to-capital target range of 45 - 50% by the second half of 2017, funded out of the strong free cash flow we expect to generate from our repositioned platform as evidenced by this debt-to-capital ratio decreasing from 58.2% at January 1, 2016 to 52.7% at September 30, 2016.

We are in compliance with all of our covenant ratios and believe that there is adequate margin between the covenant ratios and the actual ratios given the current trends of the business. For further information, including information regarding our credit arrangements, see   Note 5. "Debt"   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  In connection with our annual assessment of goodwill at the beginning of the third quarter of 2016, we bypassed the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative test for all reporting units and utilized a combination of the income and market approaches to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit, both of which are broadly defined below.  As a result of this assessment, we concluded that no impairment existed and the carrying amount of goodwill to be fully recoverable. 
  The income approach is a quantitative evaluation to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. Under the income approach we determine the fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted-average cost of capital plus a forecast risk, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return a market participant would expect to earn. The inputs used for the income approach were significant unobservable inputs, or Level 3 inputs, as described in the accounting fair value hierarchy. Estimated future cash flows were based on our internal projection models, industry projections and other assumptions deemed reasonable by management. 
  The market approach measures the fair value of a reporting unit through the analysis of recent sales, offerings, and financial multiples (sales or earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA")) of comparable businesses. Consideration is given to the financial conditions and operating performance of the reporting unit being valued relative to those publicly-traded companies operating in the same or similar lines of business. 
  The estimated fair values of our NSS and UPS reporting units were at least 10% greater than their respective carrying values.  Our EES reporting unit with goodwill of   $181.3 million   had a fair value that was approximately 1% greater than its carrying value. In performing our quantitative assessment for this reporting unit, under the income approach, we used revenue growth rates of 3.0% to 5.7%, a terminal growth rate of 3.0% and a discount rate of 9.47%. Management believes that the terminal growth rate is supported by our historical growth rate, near-term projections and long-term expected market growth. The discount rate reflects marketplace participants' cost of capital. Had we used a discount rate that was 20 basis points higher or a terminal growth rate that was 20 basis points lower than those assumed, the fair value of this reporting unit would have continued to exceed its carrying amount.  Had we more heavily weighed the market approach in estimating the fair value of this reporting unit, the excess fair value over the carrying amount would have increased.  
  A possible indicator of goodwill impairment is the relationship of a company s market capitalization to its book value. As of September 30, 2016, our market capitalization exceeded our book value and there were no impairment losses identified as a result of our annual test. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of future results.  
  There were no material changes in our critical accounting policies since the filing of our 2015 Form 10-K. For further information about recently issued accounting pronouncements, see   Note 1. "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"   in the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. As discussed in the 2015 Form 10-K, the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of reported assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

  PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER CERTIFICATION 
  I, Robert J. Eck, certify that: 
           (1) 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Anixter International Inc.; 
              (2) 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              (3) 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              (4) 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              (5) 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
