NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

NATURE OF OPERATIONS 

Digital Donations Technologies, Inc. (formerly
Fishing Ridge Acquisition Corporation) (the  Company ) was incorporated on May 21, 2015 under the laws of the state of
Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company
has been in the developmental stage since inception and its operations to date have been limited to issuing shares to its original
shareholders, filing a registration statement on Form 10 and effecting a change in control. 

On January 7, 2016, the Company effected
a change in control by effecting the following transactions: 

The Company redeemed an aggregate of 19,500,000
of the then 20,000,000 shares of outstanding common. 

James M. Cassidy resigned as the Company's
president, secretary and director and James McKillop resigned as the Company's vice president and director. 

Keith Orlean and Jeffrey Marder were named
directors of the Company and Mr. Orlean was appointed Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer of the Company and Mr. Marder was appointed
President of the Company. 

On January 8, 2016 the Company issued an
aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of its common stock as follows: 

The Company entered  into  a business
combination with, Digital Donations, Inc. ( DDI ), which has resulted in the combination of DDI with the Company through
the issuance of 79,084,807 shares of Company common stock to the shareholders of DDI on a one-for-one basis in exchange for their
shares in DDI. See further in Note 5   Subsequent Events below. 

Through its subsidiary, DDI, the Company
intends to develop and distribute creative and innovative fund raising technology and provide payment processing solutions connecting
charities and foundations with the consumer and corporate America. The Registrant anticipates developing fund raising solutions
that will expand and enhance the way charities and foundations reach donors. The Registrant perceives that through the process
of integrating a donation request as part of a financial transaction, retailers, e-tailers, ATM owners and service providers will
have the ability to create new, or enhance existing, cause marketing programs.  

BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

The summary of significant accounting policies presented below
is designed to assist in understanding the Company's unaudited condensed financial statements. Such unaudited condensed financial
statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company's management, who are responsible for their integrity
and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ) in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements. 

The accompanying unaudited financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with the condensing rules for interim financial information and with the instructions
for Form 10-Q and Article 210 8-03 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes
required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management,
all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  All such adjustments are of a normal
recurring nature.  Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative
of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016.  For further information, refer to
the financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 13, 2016. 

USE OF ESTIMATES 

The preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

CASH 

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit
at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid short-term investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Company
did not have cash or cash equivalents as of June 30, 2016.

DIGITAL DONATIONS TECHNOLOGIES, INC. 

 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

INCOME TAXES 

Under ASC 740,  Income Taxes,  deferred tax assets
and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement
carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured
using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. As of June 30, 2016 there were no deferred tax assets recorded due to the uncertainty of the realization
of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration. 

LOSS PER COMMON SHARE 

Basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed
by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted loss per common share
reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted
into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity. As of June 30, 2016,
there were no outstanding dilutive securities. 

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13), Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments. ASU 2016-13 amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the
currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result in the more timely recognition of losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective
for public entities with fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early
adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. We are
currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2016-09 (ASU 2016-09), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment award transactions including a) income tax consequences; b) classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities; and c) classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for public entities in the fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact the
adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02), Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability
in the balance sheet for all leases, including operating leases, with terms of more than twelve months. Recognition, measurement
and presentation of expenses and cash flows from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed from previous guidance. The
principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases should
be recognized in the balance sheet. The amendments also require qualitative disclosures along with specific quantitative disclosures.
The new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years,
with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our financial
statements. 

On November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-Income Taxes.
The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification Initiative).
The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted accounting principles
(GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to
users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities and assets into current
and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes,
the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement
of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position.
The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented
as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update
are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within
those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.
The Company is still in the process of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

 Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements 

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN 

The Company has not yet generated any revenue since inception
to date and has sustained operating loss of $1,975 during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The Company had a working capital
deficit of $1,118 and an accumulated deficit of $3,037 as of June 30, 2016. The Company's continuation as a going concern is dependent
on its ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing
from its members or other sources, as may be required. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have
been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the above condition raises substantial doubt
about the Company's ability to do so. The unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the
possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that
may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

In order to maintain its current level of operations, the Company
will require additional working capital from either cash flow from operations or from the sale of its equity. However, the Company
currently has no commitments from any third parties for the purchase of its equity. If the Company is unable to acquire additional
working capital, it will be required to significantly reduce its current level of operations. 

NOTE 3 - ACCRUED LIABILITIES 

As of June 30, 2016, the Company had an
accrued professional fee of $1,118. 

NOTE 4 - STOCKHOLDERS' DEFICIT 

On May 21, 2015, the Company issued 20,000,000
founders common stock to two directors and officers. The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and
20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. 

On January 7, 2016, the Company redeemed
an aggregate of 19,500,000 of the then 20,000,000 shares of outstanding stock at a redemption price of $.0001 per share for an
aggregate redemption price of $1,950. 

On January 8, 2016 the Company issued an
aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of its common stock pro rata to Keith Orlean and Jeffrey Marder. 

NOTE 5 - SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 

On October 17, 2016, the Company entered
into an Acquisition Agreement with Digital Donations, Inc. ( DDI ), in which the Company will issue 79,084,807 of its
common shares to the shareholders of DDI in exchange for 100% of the then issued and outstanding shares of DDI s common stock,
and at which time DDI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. At the time of the transaction, the Company was a reporting
public shell corporation as defined by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The effect of this transaction will be that the
financials of DDI will become those of the Company from the date of the transaction forward. In addition, the merger resulted in
the cancellation of DDI s status with the Internal Revenue Service as an S Corporation and DDI is now a C corporation, which
means that on a go-forward basis, income earned by DDI will be taxed at the corporation level and not passed through to shareholders. 

In October and November
2016, the Company issued to one shareholder an aggregate of 629,987 common shares for a total of $45,000. 

In December, the Company received
$50,000 for 699,986 common shares. Those shares have not yet been issued.

ITEM 2.  
      MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

The following discussion is intended
to assist you in understanding our business and the results of our operations. It should be read in conjunction with the Condensed
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report as well as our Report on Form 10K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 13, 2016. Certain statements made in our discussion may be forward looking.
Forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and a number of factors could cause actual results or outcomes to differ
materially from our expectations. These risks, uncertainties, and other factors include, among others, the risks described in our
Annual Report on Form 10K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as other risks described in this Quarterly
Report. Unless the context requires otherwise, when we refer to  we,   us  and  our,  we are
describing Digital Donations Technologies, Inc.  

Digital Donations Technologies, Inc. (formerly
Fishing Ridge Acquisition Corporation) (the  Company ) was incorporated on May 21, 2015 under the laws of the State of
Delaware to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions. The Company
qualifies as an  emerging growth company  as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act which became law in April,
2012. 

On January 7, 2016, the Company effected
a change in control by effecting the following transactions: 

The Company redeemed an aggregate of 19,500,000
of the then 20,000,000 shares of outstanding stock at a redemption price of $.0001 per share for an aggregate redemption price
of $1,950. 

James M. Cassidy resigned as the Company's
president, secretary and director and James McKillop resigned as the Company's vice president and director. 

Messrs. Keith Orlean and Jeffrey Marder
were named directors of the Company and Mr. Orlean was appointed its Chief Executive Officer and Treasurer and Mr. Marder its President. 

On January 8, 2016 the Company issued an
aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of its common stock pro rata to Messrs. Keith Orlean and Jeffrey Marder. 

The Company changed its name to Digital
Donations Technologies, Inc. 

On October 17, 2016, the Company entered
into an Acquisition Agreement with Digital Donations, Inc. ( DDI  or  Digital Donations ), in which the
Company will issue 79,084,807 of its common shares to the shareholders of DDI in exchange for 100% of the then issued and outstanding
shares of DDI s common stock, and at which time DDI became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. 

Plan of Operations  

Upon our acquisition of Digital Donations,
Inc. in October 2016 we entered the business of providing alternative fundraising solutions for the non-profit organization industry. 

Digital Donations is a provider of alternative
fundraising solutions for non-profit organizations ( NPOs ) that allow consumers to make charitable donations as part
of a financial transaction. The cornerstone of the business is the Digital Donations fundraising platform that allows charities
to present requests for support to potential donors as the potential donors pay for goods and services purchased from participating
merchants, at ATMs, mobile devices (MYGIV) or online through the CROWDGIV platform. These requests are for amounts called micro
donations (under $10) and have the ability to reach large segments of the population. 

The Digital Donations software automates
the solicitation, collection, payment and reporting of these donations for non profit organizations. The software can be
integrated into new or existing payment processing platforms or can operate as a standalone solution for companies who have a corporate
giving program in place or intend to develop a new one. 

- 8 -  

The Digital Donations suite of fundraising
solutions and services are tailored for the special philanthropic business needs of clients. Digital Donations provides what it
believes to be a unique approach to providing transaction processing services and credit card processing for many industries, such
as retail, specialty retail, travel and hospitality, professional sports and fund raising events, health care, e-commerce, not-for-profit,
municipalities, utilities, online bill payments, and many more. (Most consumers are familiar with this form of fundraising technology
having experienced being solicited at check-out either by a cashier or automatically through the credit card processing terminal). 

Revenue is derived directly from the funds
received by the charity from the use of the Digital Donations technology. Once the donation is made, regardless of the fundraising
platform, the donations is collected and 100% is paid directly to the charity. The Digital Donation s fundraising fees are
billed directly to the NPO. This eliminates any up-front cost to the charity or impact on its personnel, and in most cases, the
service fee is well within non-profit industry parameters, as it directly relates to the cost of the funds raised. 

The Company registered its common stock
on a Form 10 registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ) and Rule
12(g) thereof. The Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission periodic and current reports under Rule 13(a) of the
Exchange Act, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports Form 10-K. 

Subsequent to the merger, the Company has
two employees and two officers and directors. 

The Company's independent auditors have
issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. At present, the Company has
minimal operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders
and / or its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations. 

As of June 30, 2016 the Company had not
generated revenues and had no income or cash flows from operations since inception. The Company had sustained net loss of $1,975
and had an accumulated deficit of $3,037 for the six months ended and as of June 30, 2016, respectively.

Smaller reporting companies. 

ITEM 4.  
      Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosures and Procedures 

Pursuant to Rules adopted by the Securities
and Exchange Commission, the Company carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules. This evaluation was done as of the end of the period covered by this report
under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's principal executive officer (who is also the principal financial
officer). 

Based upon that evaluation, he believes
that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in gathering, analyzing and disclosing information needed
to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in its periodic reports is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports
that it files or submits under the Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

- 9 -  

This Quarterly Report does not include an
attestation report of the Company's registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's
report was not subject to attestation by the Company's registered public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the Securities
and Exchange Commission that permit the Company to provide only management's report in this Quarterly Report. 

Changes in Internal Controls 

There was no change in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting that was identified in connection with such evaluation that occurred during the period covered
by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

There are no legal proceedings against the
Company and the Company is unaware of such proceedings contemplated against it.
