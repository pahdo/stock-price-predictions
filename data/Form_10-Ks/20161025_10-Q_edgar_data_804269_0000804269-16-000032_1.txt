NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
  Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation     The condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of our consolidated subsidiaries, including certain special-purpose financing entities utilized in secured financing transactions, which are considered variable interest entities ("VIEs"). All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The interim period consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, are condensed and do not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America. These interim period condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements that are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 3, 2016 ("Form 10-K"). Except as otherwise specified, dollar amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements at   September 30, 2016  , and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , are unaudited and, in management s opinion, include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for such interim periods. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. 
  Segment Information   We are the wholly-owned captive finance subsidiary of General Motors Company ("GM"). We offer substantially similar products and services throughout many different regions, subject to local regulations and market conditions. We evaluate our business in   two   operating segments. The North America Segment includes our operations in the U.S. and Canada. The International Segment includes our operations in all other countries.  
  Recently  Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted     In February 2016 the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-02,  Leases  (ASU 2016-02), which requires the lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet thereby resulting in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for those leases currently classified as operating leases. The accounting for lessors is largely unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016 the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), which requires entities to use a current expected credit loss ("CECL") model which is a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under this model an entity would recognize an impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of all contractual cash flows that the entity does not expect to collect from financial assets measured at amortized cost. The entity's estimate would consider relevant information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which will result in recognition of lifetime expected credit losses upon loan origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently assessing the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  
   
  Note 2. Related Party Transactions  
  We offer loan and lease finance products through GM-franchised dealers to customers purchasing new and certain used vehicles manufactured by GM and make commercial loans directly to GM-franchised dealers and their affiliates. We also offer commercial loans to dealers that are consolidated by GM and those balances are included in our finance receivables, net. 
  Under subvention programs, GM makes cash payments to us for offering incentivized rates and structures on retail loan and lease finance products.  In addition, GM makes payments to us to cover certain interest payments on commercial loans. We also provide funding under lines of credit to GM, which are included in our net funding of commercial finance receivables on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 

We have related party payables due to GM, primarily for commercial finance receivables originated but not yet funded. These payables typically settle within   30 days  . The following tables present related party transactions: 

_________________  
           (a) 
    Included in finance receivables, net. 
              (b) 
    Included in related party receivables.  
               (d) 
    Included in related party payables. 
              (e) 
    Included in unsecured debt. 
              (f) 
    Included in finance charge income. 
              (g) 
    Included as a reduction to leased vehicle expenses. 
     Under our support agreement with GM (the  Support Agreement ), if our earning assets leverage ratio at the end of any calendar quarter exceeds the applicable threshold set in the Support Agreement, we may require GM to provide funding sufficient to bring our earning assets leverage ratio to within the applicable threshold. In determining our earning assets leverage ratio (net earning assets divided by adjusted equity) under the Support Agreement, net earning assets means our finance receivables, net, plus leased vehicles, net, and adjusted equity means our equity, net of goodwill and inclusive of outstanding junior subordinated debt, as each may be adjusted for derivative accounting from time to time.  
  Additionally, the Support Agreement provides that GM will own all of our outstanding voting shares as long as we have any unsecured debt securities outstanding and that GM will use its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that we will continue to be designated as a subsidiary borrower of up to   $4.0 billion   under GM s corporate revolving credit facilities, which were amended in May 2016. These amendments increased GM's borrowing capacity on its corporate revolving credit facilities from   $12.5 billion   to   $14.5 billion  . We have the ability to borrow up to   $1.0 billion   under GM's   three  -year,   $4.0 billion   unsecured revolving credit facility and   $3.0 billion   under GM's   five  -year,   $10.5 billion   unsecured revolving credit facility, subject to available capacity. GM also agreed to certain provisions in the Support Agreement intended to ensure that we maintain adequate access to liquidity. Pursuant to these provisions, GM provided us with a   $1.0 billion   junior subordinated unsecured intercompany revolving credit facility (the "Junior Subordinated Revolving Credit Facility").  
  Since October 1, 2010, we have been included in GM's consolidated U.S. federal income tax returns. For taxable income we recognize in any period beginning on or after October 1, 2010, we are obligated to pay GM for our share of the consolidated U.S. federal and certain state tax liabilities. Amounts owed to GM for income taxes are accrued and recorded as a related party payable.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there are   no   related party taxes payable to GM due to our taxable loss position.

Note 3. Finance Receivables 
   
 ________________  
  (a)  Includes   $1.3 billion   and   $1.1 billion     of direct-financing leases at     September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  . 
  (b)   Net of unearned income, unamortized premiums and discounts, and deferred fees and costs o  f   $200 million   and   $179 million   at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  . 
    
  We estimate the fair value of retail finance receivables using observable and unobservable Level 3 inputs within a cash flow model. The inputs reflect assumptions regarding expected prepayments, deferrals, delinquencies, recoveries and charge-offs of the loans within the portfolio. The cash flow model produces an estimated amortization schedule of the finance receivables.  The projected cash flows are then discounted to derive the fair value of the portfolio. Macroeconomic factors could affect the credit performance of the portfolio and, therefore, could potentially affect the assumptions used in our cash flow model. A substantial majority of our commercial finance receivables have variable interest rates and maturities of one year or less. Therefore, the carrying amount, a  Level 2 input, is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.

Retail Credit Quality   We use proprietary scoring systems in the underwriting process that measure the credit quality of the receivables using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores (e.g. FICO score), and contract characteristics. We also consider other factors, such as employment history, financial stability and capacity to pay. At the time of loan origination, substantially all of our international customers have the equivalent of prime credit scores. In the North America Segment, while we historically focused on consumers with lower than prime credit scores, we have expanded our prime lending programs. A summary of the credit risk profile by FICO score band or equivalent scores, determined at origination, of the retail finance receivables in the North America Segment is as follows: 

In addition, we review the credit quality of our retail finance receivables based on customer payment activity. A retail account is considered delinquent if a substantial portion of a scheduled payment has not been received by the date such payment was contractually due. Retail finance receivables are collateralized by vehicle titles and, subject to local laws, we generally have the right to repossess the vehicle in the event the customer defaults on the payment terms of the contract.  
  The following is a consolidated summary of the contractual amounts of retail finance receivables, which is not significantly different than recorded investment, that are (i) more than 30 days delinquent, but not yet in repossession, and (ii) in repossession, but not yet charged off:  

The accrual of finance charge income has been suspended on   $816 million   and   $778 million   of retail finance receivables (based on contractual amount due) at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  .  
  Impaired Retail Finance Receivables - TDRs   Retail finance receivables that become classified as troubled debt restructurings ("TDRs") are separately assessed for impairment. A specific allowance is estimated based on the present value of the expected future cash flows of the receivable discounted at the loan's original effective interest rate. Accounts that become classified as TDRs because of a payment deferral accrue interest at the contractual rate and an additional fee is collected (where permitted) at each time of deferral and recorded as a reduction of accrued interest. No interest or fees are forgiven on a payment deferral to a customer; therefore, there are no additional financial effects of deferred loans becoming classified as TDRs. Accounts in the U.S. in Chapter 13 bankruptcy would have already been placed on non-accrual; therefore, there are no additional financial effects from these loans becoming classified as TDRs. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 

At   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the outstanding balance of retail finance receivables in the International Segment determined to be TDRs was   insignificant  ; therefore, the following information is presented with regard to the TDRs in the North America Segment only. The outstanding recorded investment for retail finance receivables that are considered to be TDRs and the related allowance is presented below: 

Additional information about loans classified as TDRs is presented below: 

A redefault is when an account meets the requirements for evaluation under our charge-off policy. The unpaid principal balance, net of recoveries, of loans that redefaulted during the reporting period and were within 12 months of being modified as a TDR was   insignificant   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

Commercial Credit Quality   We extend wholesale credit to dealers primarily in the form of approved lines of credit to purchase new vehicles as well as used vehicles. Each commercial lending request is evaluated, taking into consideration the borrower's financial condition and the underlying collateral for the loan. We use proprietary models to assign each dealer a risk rating. These models use historical performance data to identify key factors about a dealer that we consider significant in predicting a dealer's ability to meet its financial obligations. We also consider numerous other financial and qualitative factors including, but not limited to, capitalization and leverage, liquidity and cash flow, profitability and credit history.  
  We regularly review our models to confirm the continued business significance and statistical predictability of the factors and update the models to incorporate new factors or other information that improves statistical predictability. In addition, we verify the existence of the assets collateralizing the receivables by physical audits of vehicle inventories, which are performed with increased frequency for higher risk (i.e., Groups III, IV, V and VI) dealers. We perform a credit review of each dealer at least annually and adjust the dealer's risk rating, if necessary. Dealers in Group VI are subject to additional funding restrictions including suspension of lines of credit and liquidation of assets.

Performance of our commercial finance receivables is evaluated based on our internal dealer risk rating analysis, as payment for wholesale receivables is generally not required until the dealer has sold or leased the vehicle inventory. All receivables from the same dealer customer share the same risk rating. A summary of the credit risk profile by dealer risk rating of the commercial finance receivables is as follows:    

At   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   substantially all of our commercial finance receivables were current with respect to payment status and none were classified as TDRs. Activity in the allowance for commercial loan losses was   insignificant   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
   
  Note 4. Leased Vehicles 

The following table summarizes minimum rental payments due to us as lessor under operating leases:   

Note 5. Restricted Cash 

Most of the restricted cash is held in variable interest entities, as further discussed in    Note 8    - "Variable Interest Entities." Restricted cash for securitization notes payable and revolving credit facilities includes collections from borrowers that have not yet been used for repayment of debt. In addition, this cash includes funds deposited in restricted cash accounts as collateral required to support securitization transactions or to provide additional collateral for borrowings under revolving credit facilities.  
   
  Note 6. Equity in Net Assets of Non-consolidated Affiliates 
  We use the equity method to account for our equity interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited ("SAIC-GMAC"), a joint venture that conducts auto finance operations in China. The income of SAIC-GMAC is not consolidated into our financial statements; rather, our proportionate share of the earnings is reflected as equity income.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 

We received cash dividends from SAIC-GMAC of   $129 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had undistributed earnings of   $100 million   related to SAIC-GMAC. 
   
  Note 7. Debt   

The fair value of our debt measured utilizing Level 2 inputs was based on quoted market prices for identical instruments and if unavailable, quoted market prices of similar instruments. For debt that has terms of one year or less or has been priced within the last six months, the carrying amount or par value is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of our debt measured utilizing Level 3 inputs was based on the discounted future net cash flows expected to be settled using current risk-adjusted rates. 
  Secured Debt   Most of the secured debt was issued by variable interest entities, as further discussed in    Note 8    - "Variable Interest Entities." This debt is repayable only from proceeds related to the underlying pledged finance receivables and leasing related assets.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we entered into new credit facilities or renewed credit facilities with a total additional net borrowing capacity of   $3.1 billion  , and we issued securitization notes payable of   $11.8 billion  . 
  Unsecured Debt     In March 2016, our top-tier holding company issued   $2.75 billion   in senior notes comprised of   $1.5 billion   of   4.20%   notes due in   March 2021   and   $1.25 billion   of   5.25%   notes due in   March 2026  . All of these notes are guaranteed solely by AmeriCredit Financial Services, Inc. ("AFSI").  
  In May 2016, our top-tier holding company issued   $3.0 billion   in senior notes comprised of   $1.4 billion   of   2.40%   notes due in   May 2019  ,   $1.2 billion   of   3.70%   notes due in   May 2023   and   $400 million   of floating rate notes due in   May 2019  . All of these notes are guaranteed solely by AFSI.  
  Also in May 2016, one of our European subsidiaries issued    500 million   of   1.168%   notes under our Euro medium term notes program. These notes are due in May 2020 and are guaranteed by our top-tier holding company and AFSI. 
  In July 2016, our top-tier holding company issued   $2.0 billion   of   3.20%   senior notes due in   July 2021  . These notes are guaranteed solely by AFSI. 
  In September 2016, our top-tier holding company issued    750 million   of   0.955%   notes under our Euro medium term notes program. These notes are due in September 2023 and are guaranteed solely by AFSI. 
  Subsequent to September 30, 2016, our top-tier holding company issued   $1.75 billion   in senior notes comprised of   $750 million   of   2.35%   notes due in   October 2019  ,   $750 million   of   4.00%   notes due in   October 2026   and   $250 million   of floating rate notes due in   October 2019  . All of these notes are guaranteed solely by AFSI.

During 2015, we began accepting deposits from retail banking customers in Germany. Following is summarized information for our deposits at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  : 

Compliance with Debt Covenants     Several of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders, including providing certain subsidiary financial statements. Certain of our secured debt agreements also contain various covenants, including maintaining portfolio performance ratios as well as limits on deferment levels. Our unsecured senior notes contain covenants including limitations on our ability to incur certain liens. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with these debt covenants. 
   
  Note 8. Variable Interest Entities  

These amounts are related to securitization and credit facilities held by consolidated VIEs. Our continuing involvement with these VIEs consists of servicing assets held by the entities and holding residual interests in the entities. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of each VIE because we hold both (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the VIEs' economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses from and the right to receive benefits of the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs. We are not required, and do not currently intend, to provide any additional financial support to these VIEs. Liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating these entities generally do not represent claims against us or our other subsidiaries and assets recognized generally are for the benefit of these entities operations and cannot be used to satisfy our or our subsidiaries obligations. 
  Other VIEs     We consolidate certain operating entities that provide auto finance and financial services, which we do not control through a majority voting interest. We manage these entities and maintain a controlling financial interest in them and are exposed to the risks of ownership through contractual arrangements. The majority voting interests in these entities are indirectly wholly-owned by our parent, GM. The amounts presented below are stated prior to intercompany eliminations and include amounts related to securitizations and credit facilities held by consolidated VIEs. The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities of these VIEs:

The following table summarizes the revenue and net income of these VIEs: 

Other transfers of finance receivables     Under certain debt agreements, we transfer finance receivables to entities which we do not control through majority voting interest or through contractual arrangements. These transfers do not meet the criteria to be considered sales under U.S. GAAP; therefore, the finance receivables and the related debt are included in our consolidated financial statements, similar to the treatment of finance receivables and related debt of our consolidated VIEs. Any collections received on the transferred receivables are available only for the repayment of the related debt. At   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  ,   $1.2 billion   and   $1.5 billion   in finance receivables had been transferred in secured funding arrangements to third-party banks, to which   $1.1 billion   and   $1.4 billion   in secured debt was outstanding.

    Activity is substantially offset by translation activity (included in operating expenses) related to foreign currency-denominated loans. 
     The activity for interest rate swap agreements measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) was   insignificant   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
   
  Note 10. Commitments and Contingencies 
  Guarantees of Indebtedness   The payments of principal and interest on senior notes issued by our top-tier holding company, our primary Canadian operating subsidiary and a European subsidiary are guaranteed by our primary U.S. operating subsidiary, AFSI. At   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , the par value of these senior notes was   $27.3 billion   and   $19.1 billion  . See    Note 15    - "Guarantor  Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements" for further discussion.  
  Legal Proceedings     As a retail finance company, we are subject to various customer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties, based upon, among other things, usury, disclosure inaccuracies, wrongful repossession, violations of bankruptcy stay provisions, certificate of title disputes, fraud, breach of contract and discriminatory treatment of credit applicants. Some

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued) 

litigation against us could take the form of class action complaints by customers and certain legal actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We establish reserves for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the payments can be reasonably estimated. Given the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation and regulatory matters, it is generally very difficult to predict what the eventual outcome will be, and when the matter will be resolved. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be higher or lower than any amounts reserved for the claims. At   September 30, 2016  , we estimated our reasonably possible legal exposure for unfavorable outcomes of up to   $96 million   and have accrued   $35 million  . 
  In July 2014, we were served with a subpoena by the U.S. Department of Justice directing us to produce certain documents relating to our and our subsidiaries  and affiliates  origination and securitization of sub-prime automobile loans since 2007 in connection with an investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice in contemplation of a civil proceeding for potential violations of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. Among other matters, the subpoena requests information relating to the underwriting criteria used to originate these automobile loans and the representations and warranties relating to those underwriting criteria that were made in connection with the securitization of the automobile loans. We have subsequently been served with additional investigative subpoenas to produce documents from state attorneys general and other governmental offices relating to our retail auto loan business and securitization of auto loans. These investigations are ongoing and could in the future result in the imposition of damages, fines or civil or criminal claims and/or penalties. No assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of the investigations or any resulting proceedings would not materially and adversely affect us or any of our subsidiaries and affiliates. 
  Other Administrative Tax Matters     We accrue non-income tax liabilities for contingencies when management believes that a loss is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, while contingent gains are recognized only when realized. In the event any losses are sustained in excess of accruals, they will be charged against income at that time.  
  In evaluating indirect tax matters, we take into consideration factors such as our historical experience with matters of similar nature, specific facts and circumstances, and the likelihood of prevailing. We reevaluate and update our accruals as matters progress over time. Where there is a reasonable possibility that losses exceeding amounts already recognized may be incurred, our estimate of the additional range of loss is up to   $44 million  . 
   
  Note 11. Income Taxes  
    
  For interim income tax reporting we estimate our annual effective tax rate and apply it to our year-to-date ordinary income. Tax jurisdictions with a projected or year-to-date loss for which a tax benefit cannot be realized are excluded from the annualized effective tax rate. The tax effects of unusual or infrequently occurring items, including changes in judgment about valuation allowances and effects of changes in tax laws or rates, are reported in the interim period in which they occur.  
    
  In the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , income tax expense of   $81 million   and   $219 million   primarily resulted from tax expense attributable to entities included in our effective rate calculation. In the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , income tax expense of   $52 million   and   $155 million   primarily resulted from tax expense attributable to entities included in our effective tax rate calculation. The increase in tax expense is due primarily to differences in U.S. taxation on foreign earnings. 
    
  We are included in GM s consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and for certain states  income tax returns. Net operating losses and certain tax credits generated by us  have been utilized by GM; however, income tax expense and deferred tax balances are presented in these financial statements as if we filed our own tax returns in each jurisdiction.  
   
  Note 12. Segment Reporting  
    
  We offer substantially similar products and services throughout many different regions, subject to local regulations and market conditions. We evaluate our business in   two   operating segments: the North America Segment (consisting of operations in the U.S. and Canada) and the International Segment (consisting of operations in all other countries). Our chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our business based on these operating segments. The management of each segment is responsible for executing our strategies.

For segment reporting purposes only, interest expense related to the senior notes has been allocated based on targeted leverage for each segment. Interest expense in excess of the targeted overall leverage is reflected in the "Corporate" column below. In addition, the interest income on intercompany loans provided to the international operations is presented in the "Corporate" column as revenue. Key financial data for our operating segments were as follows:

Note 13. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss   

Note 14. Regulatory Capital  
  We are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations. Our International Segment includes the operations of certain stand-alone entities that operate in local markets as either banks or regulated finance companies that are subject to regulatory restrictions. These regulatory restrictions, among other things, require that these entities meet certain minimum capital requirements and may restrict dividend distributions and ownership of certain assets. We were in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements as most recently reported.  
  Total assets of our regulated international banks and finance companies were approximately   $12.6 billion   and   $11.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  .

Note 15. Guarantor Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements  
  The payment of principal and interest on senior notes issued by our top-tier holding company is currently guaranteed solely by AFSI (the "Guarantor") and none of our other subsidiaries (the "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries"). The Guarantor is a 100% owned consolidated subsidiary and is unconditionally liable for the obligations represented by the senior notes.  The Guarantor s guarantee may be released only upon customary circumstances, the terms of which vary by issuance.  Customary circumstances include the sale or disposition of all of the Guarantor s assets or capital stock, the achievement of investment grade rating of the senior notes and legal or covenant defeasance. 
  The condensed consolidating financial statements present consolidating financial data for (i) General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (on a parent-only basis), (ii) the Guarantor, (iii) the combined Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries and (iv) the parent company and our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis at   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   (after the elimination of intercompany balances and transactions).  
  Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for by the parent company using the equity method for purposes of this presentation. Results of operations of subsidiaries are therefore reflected in the parent company's investment accounts and earnings. The principal elimination entries set forth below eliminate investments in subsidiaries and intercompany balances and transactions. 
  We determined that a revision was required to correct the classification of certain intercompany amounts between General Motors Financial Company, Inc. and Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries that were previously being presented net within the change in the due from/due to affiliates line item in the condensed consolidating balance sheet in the financing activities section of the condensed consolidating statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . As a result, correcting adjustments have been made from what was previously reported to (1) reclassify   $6.1 billion   of the net change in the due from affiliates for General Motors Financial Company, Inc. within the condensed consolidating statements of cash flows to the investing activities section; and (2) reclassify   $3.9 billion   of the net change in the due from affiliates for the Guarantor within the condensed consolidating statements of cash flows to the investing activities section. In addition, reclassifications have been made solely within the investing activities section of the condensed consolidating statements of cash flows to separately present cash flow activities related to repurchases by the Guarantor of receivables that had previously been transferred to Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries of   $945 million  . These adjustments had no effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements at or for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  Basis of Presentation   This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Form 10-K.  
    
  Forward-looking statements in this MD A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD A and the "Risk Factors" section of our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Except as otherwise specified, dollar amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. 
  Retail   Our automobile finance programs in the North America Segment include full credit spectrum lending and leasing offered through GM-franchised dealers under the "GM Financial" brand. We also offer a sub-prime lending product through non-GM franchised and select independent dealers under the "AmeriCredit" brand. Our sub-prime lending program is designed to serve customers who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions. Therefore, we generally charge higher rates than those charged by banks and credit unions and expect to sustain a higher level of credit losses than on prime lending. We finance new GM vehicles, moderately-priced new vehicles from other manufacturers, and later-model, low mileage used vehicles. 
  The retail lending and leasing programs in our International Segment focus on financing new GM vehicles and select used vehicles, predominantly for customers with prime credit scores. We also offer finance-related insurance products through third parties, such as credit life, gap and extended warranty coverage.    
  We have expanded our leasing and prime lending programs through GM-franchised dealerships in North America; therefore, leasing and prime lending have become a larger percentage of our originations and retail portfolio balance. We have been the exclusive subvented lease provider for GM in the U.S. since April 2015 and the exclusive subvented loan provider for GM in the U.S. since January 2016. We define prime lending as lending to customers with FICO scores or equivalents of 680 and greater, near-prime lending as lending to customers with FICO scores or equivalents of 620 to 679, and sub-prime lending as lending to customers with FICO scores or equivalents of less than 620. The following table presents our retail loan and lease originations in North America by FICO score band or equivalents:  

The following table summarizes the number of vehicles, by type that are included in    Note 4    - "Leased Vehicles" to the condensed consolidated financial statements, of which the North America Segment accounted for approximately   99%   at   September 30, 2016 and 2015  :

The following table summarizes additional information for North America operating leases: 

________________  
           (a) 
    Operating leases originated represents the number of operating leases we purchase during a given period. Since early 2015, operating leases originated increased due to the implementation of our exclusive subvention arrangement with GM. 
              (b) 
    Operating leases terminated represents the number of vehicles for which the lease has ended during a given period. Operating leases terminated increased due to the growth of the lease portfolio.  
              (c) 
    Operating lease vehicles returned represents the number of vehicles returned to us at the end of the lease term. Operating lease vehicles returned increased due to the growth of the lease portfolio. 
              (d) 
    Return rates are calculated as the number of operating leased vehicles returned divided by the number of operating leases terminated. Due to the age and size of our lease portfolio, the current return rates are lower than we expect them to become as our lease portfolio grows and matures. 
     Commercial   Our commercial lending program is offered primarily to our GM-franchised dealer customers and their affiliates. Commercial lending products consist of floorplan financing, also known as wholesale or inventory financing, which is lending to finance vehicle inventory, as well as dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, and to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Other commercial products include primarily parts and accessories, dealer fleet financing and storage center financing. 
  We establish new and used vehicle inventory credit lines at the time of dealer account acquisition, subject to revision as part of subsequent credit reviews. The maximum availability on these credit lines is based upon a dealer s monthly vehicle sales rate and financial strength at the time of account acquisition or periodic review, as applicable. At times, a dealer s vehicle inventory needs may exceed its credit line availability for a number of reasons, such as seasonal factory build-out, planned marketing events, reductions in sales, or other business and seasonal factors. When a dealer's needs require that its outstanding balance be allowed to exceed the maximum availability under its credit line(s), we may accept a temporary overline situation, reallocate credit amounts among existing lines, temporarily or permanently increase the dealer's credit line(s), or suspend the dealer's credit lines(s). The action we take depends on communications with the dealer, analysis of the dealer's financial condition and the underlying cause of the need for the overline. 
  Financing     We primarily finance our loan, lease and commercial originations through the use of our secured and unsecured credit facilities, through public and private securitization transactions where such markets are developed, through the issuance of unsecured debt in the public markets and by accepting deposits from retail banking customers in Germany. Generally, we seek to fund our operations through local sources of funding to minimize currency and country risk. We may issue debt globally in order to enhance investor diversification and support financing needs for North America. As such, the mix of funding sources varies from country to country, based on the characteristics of our earning assets and the relative development of the capital markets in each country.  
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  In our tabular presentation of the changes in results between financial periods, we provide the following information:  (i) the amount of change excluding the impact of foreign currency translation ( FX  (ii) the amount of the impact of foreign currency translation; and (iii) the total change. The amount of the impact of foreign currency translation was derived by translating current year results at the average of prior year exchange rates, and was driven by the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the currencies used by our foreign operations. We believe the amount of change excluding the foreign currency translation impact facilitates a better comparison of results. In our discussion below, we discuss changes in relevant items excluding any foreign currency translation impact.  
  In June 2016, the United Kingdom ("U.K.") completed its referendum on continued membership in the European Union and voted to leave. This result did not have a material impact on the results of operations for the   three or nine months ended September 30, 2016  ; however, this result has adversely impacted the British Pound and the uncertainty has put strain on the U.K. automotive industry. If current post-referendum market conditions are sustained for an extended period of time, it could have an impact on the results of our operations, which we do not expect to be material for the remainder of 2016.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Average Earning Assets: 

_________________  
           (a) 
    Average balances for the International Segment are calculated using the monthly ending balances. 
     Average earning assets   increased   in the North America Segment as a result of the continued   increase   of our share of GM's business in that segment. The   increase   in average leased vehicles, net primarily resulted from our exclusive lease subvention arrangement in the U.S. with GM, which was implemented on a brand-by-brand basis between February and April 2015. 
  In the North America Segment, the average annual percentage rate for retail finance receivables purchased during the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   to   6.2%   from   6.7%   during the prior period, and the average new retail loan size   increased  . These changes are due primarily to the expansion of our prime lending program and our exclusive loan subvention arrangement in the U.S. with GM, resulting in higher volumes of originations of loans for new vehicles, which typically are for higher amounts and have lower contractual rates due to the rate subvention support provided by GM. 
  Revenue:    

  In the North America Segment, finance charge income on retail finance receivables   remained flat   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , as the   growth   in the portfolio was substantially

offset by a   decrease   in effective yield. The effective yield on our retail finance receivables   decreased   due primarily to a decrease in the average annual percentage rate on new originations as we have increased our prime lending. The effective yield represents finance charges and fees recorded in earnings during the period as a percentage of average retail finance receivables. The effective yield, as a percentage of average retail finance receivables, is higher than the contractual rates of our auto finance contracts primarily because the effective yield includes, in addition to the contractual rates and fees, the impact of rate subvention provided by GM. 
  The   increase   in leased vehicle income reflects the   increase   in the size of the leased asset portfolio.  
  Costs and Expenses: 

(a) Amounts do not reflect allocation of senior note interest expense, and therefore may not agree with amounts presented in    Note 12    - "Segment Reporting" in our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Operating Expenses   The   increase   in operating expenses relates to the   growth   in earning assets and investments to support the prime lending program and enhance lease origination and servicing capabilities in the North America Segment. Operating expenses as an annualized percentage of average earning assets were   2.2%   and   2.5%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
    
  Leased Vehicle Expenses   Leased vehicle expenses, which are primarily comprised of depreciation of leased vehicles,   increased   due to the   growth   of the leased asset portfolio. 
    
  Provision for Loan Losses   The provision for retail loan losses   increased   due primarily to the   growth   in the retail finance receivables portfolio. As an annualized percentage of average retail finance receivables, the provision for retail loan losses was   2.1%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . The provision for commercial loan losses was   insignificant   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
  Interest Expense   Interest expense   increased   due primarily to an   increase   in the average debt outstanding resulting from   growth   in the loan and lease portfolios, partially offset by a   decrease   in the effective rate of interest on debt. 
  Taxes   Our consolidated effective income tax rate was   42.2%   and   25.7%   of income before income taxes and equity income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . The   increase   in the effective tax rate is due primarily to differences in U.S. taxation on foreign earnings. 
  Other Comprehensive Income: 
  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment   Foreign currency translation adjustments included in other comprehensive (loss) income were   $(10) million   and   $(282) million   for   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . Most of the international operations use functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Translation adjustments result from changes in the values of our international currency-denominated assets and liabilities as the value of the U.S. Dollar changes in relation to international currencies.

In the North America Segment, finance charge income on retail finance receivables increased slightly for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as the   growth   in the portfolio was substantially

offset by a   decrease   in effective yield. The effective yield on our retail finance receivables   decreased   due primarily to a decrease in the average annual percentage rate on new originations as we have increased our prime lending. The effective yield represents finance charges and fees recorded in earnings during the period as a percentage of average retail finance receivables. The effective yield, as a percentage of average retail finance receivables, is higher than the contractual rates of our auto finance contracts primarily because the effective yield includes, in addition to the contractual rates and fees, the impact of rate subvention provided by GM.   
  In the International Segment, the effective yield on our retail finance receivables decreased primarily due to asset mix. Assets in higher-yield markets have decreased while assets in lower-yield markets have increased.  
  The   increase   in leased vehicle income reflects the   increase   in the size of the leased asset portfolio.  
  Costs and Expenses: 

(a) Amounts do not reflect allocation of senior note interest expense, and therefore may not agree with amounts presented in    Note 12    - "Segment Reporting" in our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Operating Expenses   The   increase   in operating expenses relates to the   growth   in earning assets and investments to support the prime lending program and enhance lease origination and servicing capabilities in the North America Segment. Operating expenses as an annualized percentage of average earning assets were   2.2%   and   2.8%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
    
  Leased Vehicle Expenses   Leased vehicle expenses, which are primarily comprised of depreciation of leased vehicles,   increased   due to the   growth   of the leased asset portfolio. 
    
  Provision for Loan Losses   The provision for retail loan losses   increased   due primarily to the   growth   in the retail finance receivables portfolio. As an annualized percentage of average retail finance receivables, the provision for retail loan losses was   2.3%   and   2.2%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . The provision for commercial loan losses was   insignificant   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
  Interest Expense   Interest expense   increased   due primarily to an   increase   in the average debt outstanding resulting from   growth   in the loan and lease portfolios, partially offset by a   decrease   in the effective rate of interest on debt. 
  Taxes   Our consolidated effective income tax rate was   35.9%   and   26.5%   of income before income taxes and equity income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . The   increase   in the effective tax rate is due primarily to differences in U.S. taxation on foreign earnings. 
  Other Comprehensive Income: 
  Foreign Currency Translation Adjustment   Foreign currency translation adjustments included in other comprehensive (loss) income were   $60 million   and   $(524) million   for   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . Most of the international operations use functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Translation adjustments result from changes in the values of our international currency-denominated assets and liabilities as the value of the U.S. Dollar changes in relation to international currencies.

CREDIT QUALITY 

_________________  
           (a)   
    Average amount of outstanding contracts consists of retail finance receivables, net of fees, divided by number of outstanding contracts.  
       
  Delinquency   The following is a summary of the contractual amounts of delinquent retail finance receivables, which is not materially different than recorded investment that are (i) more than 30 days delinquent, but not yet in repossession and (ii) in repossession, but not yet charged off:  

Deferrals   In accordance with our policies and guidelines in the North America Segment, we, at times, offer payment deferrals to retail customers, whereby the borrower is allowed to move up to two delinquent payments to the end of the loan generally by paying a fee (approximately the interest portion of the payment deferred, except where state law provides for a lesser amount). Our policies and guidelines limit the number and frequency of deferments that may be granted. Additionally, we generally limit the granting of deferments on new accounts until a requisite number of payments have been received. Contracts receiving a payment deferral as an average quarterly percentage of average retail finance receivables outstanding were   5.1%   and   5.9%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   and   5.1%   and   5.9%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . Deferrals in the International Segment are insignificant.  
  Troubled Debt Restructurings   See    Note 3    - "Finance Receivables" to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for further discussion of TDRs.

Net Charge-offs   The following table presents charge-off data with respect to our retail finance receivables portfolio: 

_________________  
           (a) 
    Net annualized charge-off percentage is calculated as a percentage of average retail finance receivables.  
              (b) 
    Recovery percentage is a percentage of gross repossession charge-offs.   Charge-offs for the International Segment primarily include the write-down of receivables to net realizable value. As a result, a calculation of recoveries as a percentage of gross charge-offs is not meaningful.      

There     were   insignificant   charge-offs of commercial finance receivables during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . At   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015  , substantially all of our commercial finance receivables were current with respect to payment status and none were classified as TDRs. 
  Leased Vehicles     At   September 30, 2016 and 2015  ,   99.1%   and   98.4%   o  f our operating leases were current with respect to payment status.    
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  General     Our primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, servicing fees, net distributions from secured debt facilities, including securitizations, secured and unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. Our primary uses of cash are purchases of retail finance receivables and leased vehicles, the funding of commercial finance receivables, repayment of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured debt facilities, operating expenses and interest costs.  
  In the North America Segment, our purchase and funding of retail and commercial finance receivables and leased vehicles are financed initially utilizing cash and borrowings on our secured credit facilities. Subsequently, our strategy is to obtain long-term financing for finance receivables and leased vehicles through securitization transactions and the issuance of unsecured debt. 
  
    33 

     Table of Contents  
  GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC. 

In the International Segment, our purchase and funding of finance receivables are typically financed with borrowings on secured and unsecured credit facilities. In certain countries where the debt capital and securitization markets are sufficiently developed, such as in Germany and the U.K., we obtain long-term financing through securitization transactions. In addition, we raise unsecured debt in the international capital markets through the issuance of notes under our Euro medium term note program and accept deposits from retail banking customers in Germany.  
  Cash Flow   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities   increased   due primarily to increased lease vehicle income resulting from growth in the leased vehicle portfolio, partially offset by increased interest expense and increased operating expenses.  
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash used in investing activities   increased   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to an increase in purchases of leased vehicles of $3.8 billion and an increase in net fundings of commercial finance receivables of $1.5 billion, partially offset by increased collections on retail finance receivables of $1.2 billion, an increase in proceeds received on terminated leases of $1.1 billion and $924 million used for the purchase of our equity interest in SAIC-GMAC in 2015. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net cash provided by financing activities   increased   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due primarily to an increase in borrowings, net of repayments, of $1.1 billion. 

_________________  
           (a)   
    Includes   $839 million   and   $756 million   in unrestricted cash outside of the U.S. at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . This cash is considered to be indefinitely invested based on specific plans for reinvestment of these earnings. 
     During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   available liquidity increased due primarily to additional capacity on new and renewed secured credit facilities, as well as increased borrowing capacity resulting  from the issuance of unsecured debt and from increased retail deposits. 
  We have the ability to borrow up to $1.0 billion under GM's three-year, $4.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and $3.0 billion under GM's five-year, $10.5 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, subject to available capacity. Our borrowings under GM's facilities are limited by GM's ability to borrow the entire amount available under the facilities. Therefore, we may be able to borrow up to   $4.0 billion   in total or may be unable to borrow depending on GM's borrowing activity. If we do borrow under these facilities, we expect such borrowings would be short-term in nature and, except in extraordinary circumstances, would not be used to fund our operating activities in the ordinary course of business. Neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries, guarantee any obligations under these facilities and none of our assets secure these facilities. Liquidity available to us under the GM unsecured revolving credit facilities is not included in the table above. At   September 30, 2016   we had no amounts borrowed under either of GM's unsecured revolving credit facilities. 
  Credit Facilities     In the normal course of business, in addition to using our available cash, we utilize borrowings under our credit facilities, which may be secured and/or structured as securitizations, or may be unsecured, and we repay these borrowings as appropriate under our liquidity management strategy.

     Table of Contents  
  GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC. 

At   September 30, 2016  , credit facilities consist of the following:  
   
 _________________  
           (a) 
    Includes committed and uncommitted revolving credit facilities backed by retail finance receivables and leases. The financial institutions providing the uncommitted facilities are not contractually obligated to advance funds under them.  We had   $565 million   in unused borrowing capacity on these facilities at   September 30, 2016  . 
              (b) 
    Includes revolving credit facilities backed by loans to dealers for floorplan financing. 
              (c) 
    Does not include   $4.0 billion   in liquidity available to us under GM's unsecured revolving credit facilities. 
              (d) 
    The financial institutions providing the uncommitted facilities are not contractually obligated to advance funds under them. We had   $1.0 billion   in unused borrowing capacity on these facilities at   September 30, 2016  . 
     See Note 8 - "Debt" to our consolidated financial statements in our Form 10-K for further discussion of the terms of our revolving credit facilities.  
  Securitization Notes Payable     We periodically finance our retail and commercial finance receivables and leases through public and private term securitization transactions, where the securitization markets are sufficiently developed. A summary of securitization notes payable is as follows: 

_________________  
           (a) 
    Maturity dates represent legal final maturity of issued notes. The notes are expected to be paid based on amortization of the finance receivables and leases pledged. 
              (b) 
    At historical foreign currency exchange rates at the time of issuance. 
     Our securitizations utilize special purpose entities which are also VIEs that meet the requirements to be consolidated in our financial statements. See    Note 8    - "Variable Interest Entities" to our condensed consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q for further discussion.  
  Senior Notes, Retail Customer Deposits and Other Unsecured Debt   We periodically access the debt capital markets through the issuance of senior unsecured notes, predominantly from registered shelves in the U.S. and Europe. At   September 30, 2016  , the par value of our outstanding senior notes was   $27.3 billion  .  
  In the International Segment, particularly in Latin America, we issue other unsecured debt through commercial paper offerings and other non-bank funding sources. At   September 30, 2016   we had   $722 million   of this type of unsecured debt outstanding. During   2015  , we began accepting deposits from retail banking customers in Germany. At   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance of these deposits was   $1.9 billion  , of which   41%   were overnight deposits.

  GENERAL MOTORS FINANCIAL COMPANY, INC. 

Support Agreement   In order to maintain our leverage ratio in line with the GM Support Agreement, we borrowed   $415 million   on the Junior Subordinated Revolving Credit Facility. We expect to repay this borrowing during the fourth quarter of 2016. At   September 30, 2016  , our earning assets leverage ratio was   9.3  , and the applicable ratio was   9.5  .  

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
  This report contains several "forward-looking statements." Forward-looking statements are those that use words such as "believe," "expect," "intend," "plan," "may," "likely," "should," "estimate," "continue," "future" or "anticipate" and other comparable expressions. These words indicate future events and trends. Forward-looking statements are our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. These forward-looking statements are subject to many assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ significantly from historical results or from those anticipated by us. The most significant risks are detailed from time to time in our filings and reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . It is advisable not to place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to, and do not, publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, except as required by federal securities laws, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 
  The following factors are among those that may cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or from the forward-looking statements: 
             
    changes in general economic and business conditions;  
                
    GM's ability to sell new vehicles that we finance in the markets we serve in North America, Latin America, China and Europe, particularly in the U.K. where automobile sales may be negatively impacted due to the passage of the referendum to discontinue its membership in the European Union; 
                
    interest rate and currency fluctuations; 
                
    our financial condition and liquidity, as well as future cash flows and earnings; 
                
    competition; 
                
    the effect, interpretation or application of new or existing laws, regulations, court decisions and accounting pronouncements; 
                
    the availability and cost of sources of financing; 
                
    the level of net charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments on the loans and leases we originate;  
                
    vehicle return rates and the residual value performance on vehicles we lease; 
                
    the viability of GM-franchised dealers that are commercial loan customers; 
                
    the prices at which used cars are sold in the wholesale auction markets; and  
                
    changes in business strategy, including expansion of product lines and credit risk appetite, and acquisitions. 
     If one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results may vary materially from those expected, estimated or projected. 
   
  Item 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  There have been no significant changes in our exposure to interest rate risk since   December 31, 2015  . See Item 7A - "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
   
  Item 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer ("CEO") and principal financial officer ("CFO"), as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at   September 30, 2016  . Based on this evaluation, required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and/or 15d-15, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   There were no changes made in our internal control over financial reporting during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
