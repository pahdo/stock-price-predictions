HARDINGE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

NOTE 1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  In these notes, the terms  Hardinge,  or  the Company,  mean Hardinge Inc. and its predecessors together with its subsidiaries. 
    
  The Company operates through   two   reportable segments, Metalcutting Machine Solutions ( MMS ) and Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories ( ATA ). The MMS segment includes high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, vertical machining centers, horizontal machining centers, grinding machines, and repair parts related to those machines. The ATA segment includes products, primarily collets and chucks that are purchased by manufacturers throughout the lives of their Hardinge or other branded machines. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements and, therefore, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as amended. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the timing and amount of assets, liabilities, equity, revenue, and expenses reported and disclosed. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates. All adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods have been presented and recorded. Due to differing business conditions and some seasonality, operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in subsequent quarters or for the full year ended   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  In the first quarter of 2015, the Company recorded an out of period adjustment of   $0.7 million   to correct finished goods inventory.  This adjustment was related to periods beginning in 2013.  The adjustment of   $0.7 million  , which was in the Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories Segment, was to correct for costs that were not properly released from inventory as the product was sold. The Company assessed the impact of this adjustment and concluded that it is not material to previously reported financial statements. The Company also determined that the adjustment was not material to the full year in 2015, but was material to the first quarter.  
    
  Certain amounts in the   2015   consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. In order to provide greater clarity on investments in research and development, these expenses have been reclassified from Cost of Sales to Operating Expenses where the costs are identified as Research and development, a separate line item. 

NOTE 2.  FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  The inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are classified into the following categories: 
    
  Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
    
  Level 2   Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities. 
    
  Level 3   Inputs for which significant valuation assumptions are unobservable in a market and therefore value is based on the best available data, some of which is internally developed and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

The following table presents the carrying amount, fair values, and classification level within the fair value hierarchy of financial instruments measured or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands): 

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are based on the fair values of identical assets in active markets. Due to the short period to maturity or the nature of the underlying liability the fair value of variable interest rate debt approximates its respective carrying amount. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is measured using models based on observable market inputs such as spot and forward rates. Based on the Company s continued ability to enter into forward contracts, the markets for the fair value instruments are considered to be active. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   transfers in and/or out of Level 1 and Level 2. 

NOTE 3.  INVENTORIES 
    
  Net inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed in accordance with the first-in, first-out method) or market. Elements of the cost include materials, labor and overhead.  
    
  Net inventories consist of the following (in thousands): 

NOTE 4.  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
    
  Foreign currency forward contracts are utilized to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as well as on forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies. These contracts are considered derivative instruments and are recognized as either assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For contracts that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the contracts is reported as a component of other comprehensive income ( OCI ) and reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) into the  Sales  or  Cost of sales  line item on the   Consolidated Statements of Operations   when the underlying hedged transaction affects earnings, or    Other expense (income), net    when the hedging relationship is deemed to be ineffective. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments designated to qualify for cash flow hedges were   $50.9 million   and   $27.4 million  , respectively. The Company expects that approximately   $0.02 million   of expense, net of income tax effect, to be reclassified from AOCI to earnings within the next 12 months.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the notional amounts of the derivative financial instruments not qualifying or otherwise designated as hedges were   $34.3 million   and   $38.5 million  , respectively. For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , gains of   $0.5 million   and losses of   $1.9 million  , respectively, were recorded related to this type of derivative financial instrument. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, gains of   $0.03 million   and losses of   $0.3 million   were recorded related to this type of derivative financial instrument. For contracts that are not

designated as hedges, the gain or loss on the contract is recognized in current earnings in the    Other expense (income), net    line item on the   Consolidated Statements of Operations  .

NOTE 8.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES  
    
  On August 4, 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a strategic restructuring program (the "Program")     with the goals of streamlining the Company's cost structure, increasing operational efficiencies and improving shareholder returns.  This Program consists of the consolidation of certain facilities and restructuring of certain business units and is expected to incur one-time costs of   $4.3 million  .  The restructuring Program is now essentially complete, with the exception of approximately   $0.2 million   of certain costs in our German subsidiary associated with the remaining one month of a facility lease and other related expenses. The Program is expected to provide annualized savings of approximately   $4.5 million  .   
    
  Restructuring charges are included in the "Restructuring " line item in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The table below presents the total costs expected to be incurred in connection with the Program, the amount of costs that have been recognized during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the cumulative costs recognized to date by the Program (in thousands):   

During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 the Company recognized   $0.9 million   of costs under the Program.  The amounts accrued associated with the Program are included in "Accrued expenses" and "Pension and postretirement liabilities" in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. A rollforward of the accrued restructuring costs is presented below (in thousands):

NOTE 9.  INCOME TAXES  
    
  A valuation allowance is recorded against all or a portion of the deferred tax assets in the U.S., Canada, U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands. 
    
  Each quarter, a full year tax rate is estimated for jurisdictions not subject to valuation allowances based upon the most recent forecast of full year anticipated results and the year-to-date tax expense is adjusted to reflect the full year anticipated tax rate.  The rate is an estimate based upon projected results for the year, estimated annual permanent differences, the statutory tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates, and the non-recognition of tax benefits for entities with full valuation allowances.  The overall effective tax rate was   (90.5)%   and   (36.6)%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , which differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings by country and by the non-recognition of tax benefits for certain entities in a loss position for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded.  Additionally, in 2016, the Company s effective tax rate was impacted by a one-time dividend from an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary in China to its parent, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary in Switzerland, of which   $0.6 million   of the total income tax expense is related to the associated withholding taxes. 
    
  The tax years 2013 through 2015 remain open to examination by the U.S. federal taxing authorities.  The tax years 2010 through 2015 remain open to examination by the U.S. state taxing authorities.  For other major jurisdictions (Switzerland, U.K., Taiwan, France, Germany, Netherlands, China, and India), the tax years between 2008 and 2015 generally remain open to routine examination by foreign taxing authorities, depending on the jurisdiction. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , a liability of   $2.2 million   is recorded with respect to uncertain income tax positions, which includes related interest of   $0.1 million  .  If recognized, essentially all of the uncertain tax positions and related interest at   September 30, 2016   would be recorded as a benefit to income tax expense on the   Consolidated Statements of Operations  .  It is reasonably possible that some of the uncertain tax positions pertaining to foreign operations may change within the next 12 months due to audit settlements and statute of limitations expirations.  The change in uncertain tax positions for these items is estimated to be up to   $1.3 million  . 

NOTE 10.  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  The Company is a defendant in various lawsuits as a result of normal operations and in the ordinary course of business. Management believes the outcome of these lawsuits will not have a material effect on the financial position or results of operations. 
    
  The Company s operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental matters. Certain environmental laws can impose joint and several liability for releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances upon certain statutorily defined parties regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original activity or disposal. Hazardous substances and adverse environmental effects have been identified with respect to real property owned by the Company, and on adjacent parcels of real property. 
    
  In particular, the Elmira, NY manufacturing facility is located within the Kentucky Avenue Wellfield on the National Priorities List of hazardous waste sites designated for cleanup by the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) because of groundwater contamination. The Kentucky Avenue Wellfield Site (the  Site ) encompasses an area which includes sections of the Town of Horseheads and the Village of Elmira Heights in Chemung County, NY. In February 2006, the Company received a Special Notice Concerning a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study ( RI/FS ) for the Koppers Pond (the  Pond ) portion of the Site. The EPA documented the release and threatened release of hazardous substances into the environment at the Site, including releases into and in the vicinity of the Pond. The hazardous substances, including metals and polychlorinated biphenyls, have been detected in sediments in the Pond. 
    
  Until receipt of this Special Notice in February 2006, the Company had never been named as a potentially responsible party ( PRP ) at the Site nor had the Company received any requests for information from the EPA concerning the Site. Environmental sampling on the Company s property within this Site under supervision of regulatory authorities had identified off-site sources for such groundwater contamination and sediment contamination in the Pond, and found no evidence

     Table of Contents  
    
  HARDINGE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 

that the Company s operations or property have contributed or are contributing to the contamination. All appropriate insurance carriers have been notified, and the Company is actively cooperating with them, but whether coverage will be available has not yet been determined and possible insurance recovery cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty at this time. 
    
  A substantial portion of the Pond is located on the Company s property. The Company, along with Beazer East, Inc., the Village of Horseheads, the Town of Horseheads, the County of Chemung, CBS Corporation and Toshiba America, Inc., (collectively, the "PRPs"), agreed to voluntarily participate in the RI/FS by signing an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order of Consent on September 29, 2006. On September 29, 2006, the Director of Emergency and Remedial Response Division of the EPA, Region II, approved and executed the Agreement on behalf of the EPA. The PRPs also signed a PRP Member Agreement, agreeing to share the costs associated with the RI/FS study on a per capita basis. 
    
  The EPA approved the RI/FS Work Plan in May of 2008. On July 6, 2012 the PRPs submitted the Remedial Investigation (RI). On July 18, 2016 the PRPs submitted the final Feasibility Study (FS) and the EPA issued the Record of Decision on September 30, 2016.  
    
  Based upon Alternative 3 (Capping), the preferred EPA remedy, the Company, under present circumstances, would be responsible for   $0.3 million   of the estimated   $1.92 million   cost. This has been reserved and reported as an Accrued expense on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Based upon information currently available, except as described in the preceding paragraphs, the Company does not have material liabilities for environmental remediation. Though the foregoing reflects the Company s current assessment as it relates to environmental remediation obligations, it is possible that future remedial requirements or changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations, which are subject to extensive regulatory discretion, will result in material liabilities to the Company.

NOTE 12.  STOCK BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  All stock based compensation to employees is recorded as "  Selling, general and administrative expenses  " in the   Consolidated Statements of Operations   based on the fair value at the grant date of the award. These non-cash compensation costs are included in the depreciation and amortization amounts in the   Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows  . 
    
  A summary of stock based compensation expense is as follows (in thousands): 

There were   no   RSAs granted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. The deferred compensation is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the specified service period. There were   no   PSIs granted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The deferred compensation with respect to the PSIs is being recognized into earnings based on the passage of time and achievement of performance targets. All outstanding RSAs and PSIs are unvested.         
    
  Unrecognized compensation and the expected weighted-average recognition periods with respect to the outstanding RSAs and PSIs as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are as follows: 

As of March 31, 2016,   $0.6 million   of unrecognized compensation cost associated with the cancellation of PSIs granted in 2011 was released as a result of not meeting performance targets prior to the date of expiration.

NOTE 14.  EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE  
    
  Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. In periods of earnings, the weighted  average number of shares used in the diluted calculation includes common stock equivalents related to stock options and restricted stock. The following table presents the basis of the earnings (loss) per share computation (in thousands):     

There is no dilutive effect of the restricted stock and stock options for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   due to the net loss in those periods. There would have been   90,405   and   93,245   of shares included in the diluted calculation for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   85,723   and   97,539   shares included in the diluted earnings per share calculation for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, had the impact of including these securities not been anti-dilutive.  Common stock equivalents of certain stock-based awards totaling   10,877   were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   as they were anti-dilutive. Common stock equivalents of certain stock-based awards totaling   771   and   19,989   were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, as they were anti-dilutive.

NOTE 16.  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
    
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued amended guidance on the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs.  This guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts while the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs is not affected.  In August 2015, FASB subsequently issued an amended guidance to clarify debt issuance costs associated with a line-of-credit arrangement, which allow an entity to defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  The amendments are required to be applied retrospectively to all prior periods. 
       
  In January 2016, the Company adopted the guidance.  As a result, the Company reclassified   $0.07 million   and   $0.09 million   of debt issuance cost as of December 31, 2015 into   Current portion of long-term debt   and   Long-term debt   respectively to reduce the carrying amount of debt liability, from   Other current assets   and   Other non-current assets   on the   Consolidated Balance Sheets  .  Debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements remained in the   Other current assets   and   Other non-current assets   on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Unamortized debt issuance costs of   $0.06 million   and   $0.05 million   are recorded as   Other current assets   and   Other non-current assets   respectively, and   $0.07 million   and   $0.04 million   were recorded as   Current portion of long-term debt   and   Long-term debt   respectively to reduce the carrying amount of debt liability, on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at   September 30, 2016  .  The Company's debt issuance cost amortization was not affected by the adoption of the new guidance.   
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an amended guidance on improvements to employee share-based payment accounting.  The guidance includes multiple provisions to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. These amendments are expected to impact net income, EPS, and the statement of cash flows.  In particular, the tax effects of all stock compensation awards will be included in income.  The guidance is effective for public companies in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period, with all adjustments applied as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  The Company is assessing the impact and method of adoption.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Overview.    The following Management s Discussion and Analysis ( MD A ) contains information that the Company believes is necessary to understand the Company s financial condition and associated matters, including the Company s liquidity, capital resources and results of operations. The MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our unaudited financial statements, the accompanying notes to the financial statements ( Notes ) appearing elsewhere in this report and our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as amended. 
    
  We supply high precision computer controlled metalcutting turning machines, grinding machines, vertical machining centers, and repair parts related to those machines. The Company also engineers and supplies high precision, standard and specialty workholding devices, and other machine tool accessories. We believe our products are known for accuracy, reliability, durability, and value. We are geographically diversified with manufacturing facilities in China, France, Germany, India, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United States ( U.S. ), and the United Kingdom ( U.K. ), with sales to most industrialized countries. Approximately   66%   of our 2015 sales were to customers outside of North America,   70%   of our 2015 products sold were manufactured outside of North America, and   69%   of our employees as of   December 31, 2015   were employed outside of North America. 
    
  Metrics on machine tool market activity monitored by our management include world machine tool shipments, as reported annually by Gardner Publications in the Metalworking Insiders Report, and metal-cutting machine orders, as reported by the Association of Manufacturing Technology, the primary industry group for U.S. machine tool manufacturers. Other closely followed U.S. market indicators are tracked to determine activity levels in U.S. manufacturing plants that are prospective customers for our products. One such measurement is the Purchasing Managers Index, as reported by the Institute for Supply Management. Another measurement is capacity utilization of U.S. manufacturing plants, as reported by the Federal Reserve Board. Similar information regarding machine tool shipments and economic indicators in foreign countries is published by trade associations, government agencies, and economic services in those countries. 
    
  Non-machine sales, which include collets, chucks, accessories, repair parts and service revenue, accounted for approximately   35%   of overall sales through the   third   quarter of   2016   and are an important part of our business due to an installed base of thousands of machines, and the growing needs demanded by specialty workholding applications. In the past, sales of these products and services have not fluctuated on a year-to-year basis as significantly as the sales of our machines have from time to time, but demand for these products and services typically track the direction of the related machine metrics. 
    
  Other key performance indicators are geographic distribution of net sales ( sales ) and net orders ( orders ), gross profit as a percent of sales, income from operations, working capital changes, and debt level trends. In an industry where constant product technology development has led to an average model life of three to five years, effectiveness of technological innovation and development of new products are also key performance indicators. 
    
  We are exposed to financial market risk resulting from changes in interest and foreign currency rates. Global economic conditions and related disruptions within the financial markets have also increased our exposure to the possible liquidity and credit risks of our counterparties. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our foreseeable business needs, including cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, our bank financing arrangements, and equity financing arrangements. 
    
  We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents. Our emphasis is primarily on safety of principal. Our cash and cash equivalents are diversified among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. 
    
  We are subject to credit risks relating to the ability of counterparties of hedging transactions to meet their contractual payment obligations. The risks related to creditworthiness and non-performance has been considered in the fair value measurements of our foreign currency forward exchange contracts. 
    
  We expect that some of our customers and vendors may experience difficulty in maintaining the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials. We continue to monitor our customers  financial condition in order to mitigate the risk associated with our ability to collect on our accounts receivable. 

21 

Foreign currency exchange rate changes can be significant to reported results for several reasons. Our primary competitors, particularly for the most technologically advanced products, are now largely manufacturers in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, Korea, and Taiwan, which causes the worldwide valuation of their respective currencies to be central to competitive pricing in all of our markets. The major functional currencies of our subsidiaries are the British Pound Sterling ( GBP ), Chinese Yuan ( CNY ), Euro ( EUR ), New Taiwanese Dollar ( NTD ), and Swiss Franc ( CHF ). Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars ( USD ) at the average exchange rate during the periods presented. Period-to-period changes in the exchange rate between their local currency and the USD may affect comparative data significantly. We also purchase computer controls and other components from suppliers throughout the world, with purchase costs reflecting currency changes. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, foreign currency fluctuations resulted in unfavorable currency translation impact of approximately   $1.3 million   and   $4.8 million   on sales when compared to the same period in   2015  . 

Results of Operations 
    
  Presented below is summarized selected financial data for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):  

Sales  .  The table below summarizes sales by each corresponding geographical region for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   (in thousands):  

22 

Sales for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $67.2 million  , a decrease of   $9.6 million  , or   12.5%  , compared with the prior-year period. The decline in sales is primarily related to a $8.8 million decrease in our Metalcutting Machine Solutions ("MMS") segment. Foreign currency translation was unfavorable by   $1.3 million  . Excluding the translation impact, the decline in sales would have been   10.8%  . 
    
  Sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $205.2 million  , a decrease of   $23.1 million  , or   10.1%  , compared with the prior-year period. The decline in sales is primarily related to a $21.1 million decrease in our MMS segment. Foreign currency translation was unfavorable by   $4.8 million  . Excluding the translation impact, the decline in sales would have been   8.0%  . 
    
  North America sales were   $24.8 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , flat when compared with the prior-year period, despite weaker industrial conditions in the U.S. through 2016. North America sales were   $62.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , down   21.4%   when compared with the same prior-year period.  The year-over-year decrease in sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is mainly the result of lower sales from the MMS segment as compared with the prior-year due to lower demand for capital goods in that market, as also exhibited in industry published data. 
    
  Europe sales were   $18.3 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $3.3 million  , or   15.3%  , when compared with the prior-year period.  Foreign currency translation adjustment for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   had an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately   $0.3 million  . Excluding the impact of translation, the sales decline was   $3.0 million  , or   13.9%  , compared with the prior-year period. Virtually all of the decrease was driven by lower levels of grinding machine order activity in late 2015 and early 2016. 
    
  Europe sales were   $64.4 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $2.2 million  , or   3.3%  , when compared with the prior-year period.  Foreign currency translation adjustment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   had an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately   $1.4 million  . Excluding the impact of translation, the sales decline was   $0.8 million  , or   1.2%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period.  
    
   Asia and other sales were   $24.2 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $6.4 million  , or   21.0%  , when compared with the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation adjustment for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   had an unfavorable impact on sales of approximately   $1.0 million  .  Excluding the impact of translation, the sales decline was   $5.4 million  , or   17.6%  , for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period. This decrease was driven by a $4.1 million  multiple machine sale to a customer supplying the consumer electronics industry in China in 2015 which did not recur in 2016.  
    
  Asia and other sales were   $77.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $3.8 million  , or   4.6%  , when compared with the prior-year period. Foreign currency translation adjustment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   had an unfavorable impact of approximately   $3.4 million  .  Excluding the impact of translation, the sales decline was   $0.4 million  , or   0.5%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the prior-year period. Sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included a $5.3 million of multiple machine sales to a customer supplying the consumer electronics industry in China. Demand from customers in China is the key driver of the performance of the machine tool industry, and while machine tool industry data from China has been subdued, Hardinge has been able to maintain sales volume levels in the customer segments that it serves. 
    
  Sales of machines accounted for approximately   65%   of the consolidated sales for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , while sales of non-machine products and services, primarily consisting of collets, chucks, accessories, repair parts, and service revenue, accounted for approximately   35%   of the consolidated sales for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Gross Profit.    Gross profit was   $23.2 million  , or   34.4%   of sales for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $25.4 million  , or   33.0%   of sales for the prior-year period. The primary cause of reduced gross profit was the impact of lower sales volume, partially offset by $0.5 million in savings from the Company s 2015 restructuring program.  The improvement in gross margin percentage was due to an improved product mix and the restructuring savings, partially offset by the impact of lower volume over fixed manufacturing costs. 
    
  Gross profit was   $69.4 million   or   33.8%   of sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $74.2 million   or   32.5%   of sales for the prior-year period. Gross profit and margin for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was impacted by lower volume, partially offset by   $1.0 million     in savings from the Company s restructuring program, as well as the non-recurrence of an out of period inventory adjustment of   $0.7 million   recorded in the first quarter of   2015   at one of our European subsidiaries to correct for costs that were not properly released from inventory as the product was sold.  

23 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.    Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses were   $20.0 million  , or   29.7%   of sales for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   $0.1 million   increase compared with   $19.9 million  , or   25.9%   of sales for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, SG A included $0.8 million for a pension settlement charge due to the retirement of a senior executive, $0.2 million related to severance and $0.1 million for professional fees related to the strategic review process. For the quarter ended September 30, 2015, SG A included an expense of $0.3 million related to the strategic review process. Excluding these items, SG A would have been $18.9 million and $19.6 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $0.7 million. For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company realized   $0.3 million   in savings from the restructuring program and $0.4 million in favorable currency translation.  
    
  SG A expenses were   $60.2 million  , or   29.3%   of sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , down   $0.4 million   compared with   $60.6 million  , or   26.5%   of sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, SG A included costs of $1.2 million for professional fees related to the strategic review process, $0.8 million for a pension settlement charge and $0.3 million related to severance. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, SG A included an expense of $0.3 million related to the strategic review process. Excluding these items, SG A for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 would have been $57.9 million and $60.3 million, respectively, a decrease of $2.4 million.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company realized $1.1 million of savings from the restructuring program and $1.5 million in favorable currency translation, offset by an increase of $0.2 million in variable selling expense.  
    
  Research and Development Expenses.    Research and Development ("R D") expenses were   $3.3 million  , or   4.9%   of sales for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , down   $0.3 million   or   9%  , compared with   $3.6 million  , or   4.7%   of sales for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the quarter,   $0.2 million   of savings resulted from the restructuring program.  
    
  R D expenses were   $10.0 million  , or   4.8%   of sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $0.8 million  , or   7.1%   compared with   $10.7 million  , or   4.7%   of sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  For the year,   $0.7 million   of savings resulted from the restructuring program.  
    
  Other (Income) Expense, Net.     Net other expense increased by   $0.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with the same prior-year period while net other expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   remained flat compared with the same prior-year period.  Variances are primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods as compared with the same periods in   2015  . 
    
  (Loss) Income Before Income Taxes  .  As a result of the foregoing, loss before income taxes was   $0.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with income before income taxes of   $0.6 million   for the same period in   2015  .  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , loss before income taxes was   $1.8 million   compared with income before income taxes of   $1.3 million   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Income Taxes.    The income tax provision was   $0.7 million   for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with an income tax provision of   $1.0 million   and   $1.5 million   for the same periods in   2015  .  The effective tax rate was   (90.5)%   and   (36.6)%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   151.5%   and   111.2%   for the same periods in   2015  , which differs from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the mix of earnings by country and by the non-recognition of tax benefits for certain entities in a loss position for which a full valuation allowance has been recorded.  Additionally, in 2016, the Company's effective tax rate was impacted by a withholding tax of $0.6 million on a one-time dividend from an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary in China to its parent, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary in Switzerland. 
    
  Each quarter, an estimate of the full year tax rate is developed based upon anticipated annual results and an adjustment is made, if required, to the year-to-date income tax expense to reflect the full year anticipated effective tax rate. 
    
  We continue to maintain a valuation allowance on all or a portion of the tax benefits of our U.S., Canada, U.K., Germany, and the Netherlands net deferred tax assets and we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until an appropriate level of profitability is sustained in the respective jurisdiction. 
    
  Net Loss.    As a result of the foregoing, net loss for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.4 million  , or   2.1%   of sales, compared with a net loss of   $0.3 million  , or   0.4%   of sales, for the same period in   2015  .  Net loss for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.5 million  , or   1.2%   of sales, compared with a net loss of   $0.1 million  , or   0.1%   of sales, for the same period in   2015  .  Both basic and diluted loss per share for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $(0.11)   and   $(0.19)  , compared to   $(0.03)   and   $(0.01)   for the same periods in   2015  .

Business Segment Information   Comparison of the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Metalcutting Machine Solutions Segment (MMS) (in thousands): 

MMS sales were   $52.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $8.8 million  , or   14.4%   when compared with the corresponding period in   2015  .  After considering   $1.2 million   of unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation adjustments, sales would have decreased by   $7.6 million   or   12.5%  .  The decrease was driven by a $10.0 million decline in the Turning   Milling product line, primarily due to the uncertainty in the global industrial markets for capital goods, offset by a $1.2 million increase in the Grinding product line.  MMS sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $158.7 million  , a decrease of   $21.3 million  , or   11.8%  , when compared with the same period in 2015 primarily due to the uncertainty in global industrial markets.  This decrease was driven by a $15.2 million decline in the Turning   Milling product line and $6.1 million in the Grinding product line.  After considering   $4.7 million   of unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation adjustments, sales would have decreased by   $16.6 million   or   9.2%  .  
    
  Segment loss for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.0 million  , a decrease of   $1.9 million  , or   209.9%   when compared with segment income of   $0.9 million   in the prior year. The key driver was the impact of lower volume, partially offset by lower spending in manufacturing and SG A and $0.2 million of savings from the restructuring program.      For the     nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , segment loss was   $1.9 million  , a decrease of   $3.6 million  , or   207.8%  , when compared with segment income of   $1.7 million   in the same period 2015. The primary driver was the impact of reduced volume, partially offset by reductions in manufacturing and SG A costs and $0.6 million of savings from the restructuring program. 
    
  Aftermarket Tooling and Accessories Segment (ATA)     (in thousands): 

ATA sales for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $15.3 million  , a decrease of   $0.7 million  , or   4.6%  , when compared with the corresponding period in   2015  . The primary driver of the decline in sales was $0.7 million in North America, as sales in Asia and Europe remained generally flat compared to the prior year period.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , ATA sales were   $46.8 million  , a decrease of   $2.1 million  , or   4.4%  , when compared with the same period in 2015.  The primary driver of the decline in sales was $1.2 million of lower sales to Europe and $1.1 million of lower sales to Asia, offset by a $.03 million increase in North America when compared to the prior year period.  
    
  Segment income for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.8 million  , a   $0.8 million  , or   71%   increase from the prior year. The ATA segment experienced increased profitability primarily as a result of $0.8 million in savings from the restructuring program, reduced by $0.2 million of cost to implement. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , segment income was   $5.3 million  , an increase of   $1.2 million   or   29.1%  , when compared with segment income of   $4.1 million   in the same period 2015. The primary driver of this increase is $2.2 million in savings from the restructuring program, reduced by $0.6 million of cost to implement, in addition to the non-recurrence of an out of period inventory adjustment of $0.7 million at one of our European subsidiaries to correct for costs that were not properly released from inventory as the product was sold in 2015. This was partially offset by the impact of lower sales volume.

Segment Summary For the   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

Summary of Cash Flows for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :    

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we used   $4.3 million   net cash from operating activities. The net cash used was driven by a net loss (adjusted for non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense as well as the impact of unrealized foreign currency transaction loss), an increase in inventory based on orders and associated production levels, and decreases in accounts payable due to timing of purchases and payment activity, customer deposits due to timing of shipments and new orders received, and accrued expenses, primarily as a result of payment of annual incentive compensation, severance pay related to restructuring, sales commission payable, as well as the payment of the annual Company contribution to the 401(k) Plan.  These uses of cash were partially offset by cash generated from a reduction in customer accounts receivable due to the timing of sales and collection activity. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we generated   $9.0 million   net cash from operating activities. The net cash generated was driven by an add back of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense to the net loss, a decrease in customer receivables due to the timing of sales and collection activity, an increase in customer deposits due to timing of shipments and new orders received, an increase in other accrued expenses primarily as a result of accruals made during the third quarter of 2015 in connection with the restructuring activities combined with higher commissions payable and increased warranty reserves as a result of higher sales compared to the prior year period, and an increase in accounts payable due to  
  
   26 

timing of purchases and payment activity. These cash inflows were partially offset by an increase in inventories based on orders and associated production levels combined with an increase in other assets. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $1.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The primary use of cash was for capital expenditures during the period, which were made primarily for maintenance capital purchases.  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities was   $3.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The primary use of cash was for capital expenditures, which were made primarily for maintenance capital purchases. 
    
  Net cash flow used in financing activities was   $4.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Cash used was primarily attributable to   $3.2 million   of payments on long-term debt due to normal scheduled payment activity and year-to-date dividends paid of   $0.8 million  .   
    
  Net cash flow used by financing activities was   $4.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Cash used by financing activities was primarily driven by   $3.2 million   of payments on long-term debt due to normal scheduled payment activity and year-to-date dividends paid of   $0.8 million  .  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We maintain financing arrangements with several financial institutions. These financing arrangements are in the form of long term loans, credit facilities, and lines of credit. The credit facilities allow us to borrow up to   $76.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $77.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  , of which   $54.3 million   and   $54.1 million  , respectively, can be borrowed for working capital needs. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $67.4 million   and   $69.8 million   was available for borrowing under these respective arrangements, of which   $51.9 million   and   $53.2 million  , respectively, was available for working capital needs. Total consolidated borrowings outstanding were   $8.6 million   and   $11.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Our financing arrangements contain certain debt covenant requirements, including financial covenants, representations, affirmative and negative covenants, prepayment provisions and events of default. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 
    
  Our liquidity requirements primarily include funding for operations, including working capital requirements, and funding for capital investments and acquisitions. We expect to meet these requirements in the long term through cash provided by operating activities and availability under various credit facilities and other financing arrangements. Cash flows from operating activities are primarily driven by earnings before non-cash charges and change in working capital needs. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , available cash was sufficient to fund our normal investment activities, primarily capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and other productive assets. 
    
  We assess on an ongoing basis our portfolio of operations, as well as our financial and capital structures, to ensure we have sufficient capital and liquidity to meet our strategic objectives. As part of this process, from time to time we evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities that we believe will enhance our strategic position. 
    
  Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted  
    
  We are currently assessing the financial impact to our consolidated financial statements of accounting guidance not yet adopted. For further information on accounting guidance not yet adopted, refer to   Note 16. "New Accounting Standards"   of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words  believes,   project,   expects,   anticipates,   estimates,   intends,   strategy,   plan,   may,   will,   would,   will be,   will continue,   will likely result,  and similar expressions. Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our expectations will be realized. Such statements are based upon information known to management at this time. The Company cautions that such statements necessarily involve uncertainties and risk and deal with matters beyond the Company s ability to control, and in  
  
   27 

many cases the Company cannot predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated. Among the many factors that could cause actual results to differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements are fluctuations in the machine tool business cycles, changes in general economic conditions in the U.S. or internationally, the mix of products sold and the profit margins thereon, the relative success of the Company s entry into new product and geographic markets, the Company s ability to manage its operating costs, actions taken by customers such as order cancellations or reduced bookings by customers or distributors, competitors  actions such as price discounting or new product introductions, governmental regulations and environmental matters, changes in the availability and cost of materials and supplies, the implementation of new technologies and currency fluctuations. Any forward-looking statement should be considered in light of these factors. The Company undertakes no obligation to revise its forward-looking statements if unanticipated events alter their accuracy.

   3 - 

partnership, corporation or other business organization or entity other than the Company: (x) solicit or endeavor to entice away from the Company or any of its subsidiaries any person or entity who is, or, during the then most recent 12-month period, was employed by, or had served as an agent or key consult  ant of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; or (y) solicit or endeavor to entice away from the Company or any of its subsidiaries any person or entity who is, or was within the then most recent 12-month period, a customer or client (or reasonably anticipated to the general knowledge of the Employee or the public to become a customer or client) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

  The competition prohibition is valid for the entire area in which the Company conducts its business, and in the countries in which the company has been active. In the event of any infringement against the competition prohibition, the Employee owes the Company a contractual penalty equivalent to one half of the most recent total annual compensation paid by the Company to the Employee, without limiting the Company to claim the real damages if the damages suffered by the Company are more important than the Contractual penalty. 
    
  6.3     Confidentiality.     The Employee covenants and agrees with the Company that he will not at any time, except in performance of his obligations to the Company hereunder or with the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, disclose any secret or confidential information that he may learn or has learned by reason of his association with the Company or any of its subsidiaries and affiliates. The term "  confidential information  " includes information not previously dis closed to the public or to the trade by the Company's management, or otherwise in the public domain, with respect to the Company's or any of its subsidiaries' or affiliates' products, facilities, applications and methods, trade secrets and other intellectual property, systems, procedures, manuals, confidential reports, product price lists, customer lists, technical in  formation, financial information (including the revenues, costs of profits associated with any of the Company's products), business plans, prospects or opportunities, but shall exclude any information which (i) is or becomes available to the public or is generally known in the industry or industries in which the Company operates other than as a result of disclosure by the Employee in violation of his agreements under this  
  
   4 - 

Section 6.2 or (ii) the Employee is required to disclose under any applicable laws, regulations or directives or any government agency, tribunal or authority having jurisdiction in the matter or under subpoena or other process of law.
