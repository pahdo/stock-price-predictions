CHINA MEDIA INC.  
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  
  September 30, 2016  
   
  NOTE 1.     Description of Business  
   
 China Media Inc. ( we ,  our , the  Company ,  China Media ), formerly Protecwerx Inc., was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 16, 2007. 
   
 The Company does not conduct any substantive operations of its own; rather, it conducts its primary business operations through Vallant Pictures Entertainment Co., Ltd., its wholly owned subsidiary incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, which in turn, conducts its business through Xi an TV Media Co. Ltd. ( Xi An TV ). Effective control over Xi An TV was transferred to the Company through the series of contractual arrangements without transferring legal ownership in Xi An TV. As a result of these contractual arrangements, the Company maintained the ability to approve decisions made by Xi An TV and was entitled to substantially all of the economic benefits of Xi An TV. 
   
 Xi An TV was incorporated in Xi An, Shaan Xi Province, People s Republic of China ( PRC ) and is in the business of investing, producing and developing film and television programming for the Chinese market. 
   
  NOTE 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
   
     Basis of Presentation and Consolidation   
   
 The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of China Media Inc. ( We  or the  Company ), have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s annual financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the consolidated financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016 included in this document have been omitted. 
   
   Use of Estimates   
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes, including estimates of ultimate revenues and ultimate costs of film and television products, the amount of receivables that ultimately will be collected, the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company s financial statements and loss contingencies. Actual results could differ from those estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, the Company s financial condition or results of operations will be affected. Estimates are made based on past experience and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances, and management evaluates these estimates on an ongoing basis. 
   
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
   
 In September 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control . These amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. If a reporting entity satisfies the first characteristic of a primary beneficiary (such that it is the single decision maker of a variable interest entity), the amendments require that reporting entity, in determining whether it satisfies the second characteristic of a primary beneficiary, to include all  

7 

of its direct variable interests in a variable interest entity and, on a proportionate basis, its indirect variable interests in a variable interest entity held through related parties, including related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity adopts the pending content that links to this paragraph in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
   
  NOTE 3. Related Party Transactions   
   
 From time to time, the Company borrowed loans from Dean Li, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company owed Dean Li $271,439 and $272,501, respectively. The loans borrowed from Mr. Dean Li are non-secured, free of interest with no specified maturity date. The imputed interests are assessed as an expense to the business operation and an addition to the paid-in-capital and calculated based on annual interest rate in the range of 5.94-6.56% with reference to one-year loan. 
   
 In July 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to invest RMB 5 million (approximately $752,627) in a film that is produced by Beijing Huaxia Star Media Co., Ltd. and the payment was made in August 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the film is still in preparation stage. Dean Li, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, holds 13% equity interest in Beijing Huaxia Star Media Co., Ltd. 
   
  NOTE 4. Accounts Receivable  

NOTE 5. Notes Receivable  
   
 On March 20, 2013, the Company lent RMB 946,500 (approximately $155,000) in the form of an interest free loan to China Fengde Movie and TV Copyright Agency ( Zhongshi Fengde ), one of the Company s business partners. The Company collected RMB 530,000 (approximately $86,305) as of June 30, 2015. No repayment was collected during the year ended June 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, an allowance of RMB 208,250 (approximately $31,225) was reserved by the Company against the note receivable. 
   
 On June 13, 2014, the Company lent RMB 18 million (approximately $2,931,119) to Shaan Xi Hushi Culture Communication Company (SHCC), a company owned by a business friend of Dean Li, the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. Based on the agreement, the Company will waive interest on the loan if SHCC repays the loan within 30 days; the Company will charge interest rate at 200% of the prevailing PRC prime rate if SHCC repays the loan after 30 days. In July 2014, the Company received repayment of RMB 11 million (approximately $1,786,410) and SHCC orally promised to pay off the remaining balance no later than December 31, 2016. On January 8, 2015, the Company received interest of RMB 455,000 (approximately $74,165) on the loan. The outstanding balance was RMB 7 million (approximately $1,049,570) as of September 30, 2016 and an allowance of RMB 3.5 million (approximately $524,784) was reserved by the Company against the note receivable. 
   
 On July 1, 2014, the Company lent an additional RMB 3 million (approximately $487,203) to SHCC with three months term. Based on the agreement, the Company will waive interest on the loan if SHCC repays the loan within 30 days; the Company will charge interest rate at four times of the current bank loan rate if SHCC repays the loan after 30 days. On January 19, 2015, the Company received interest of RMB 360,000 (approximately $58,694) on the loan. In September 2016, the Company received repayment of RMB 100,000 (approximately $15,002) from SHCC. An allowance of RMB 1.5 million (approximately $224,908) was reserved by the Company against the note receivable as of September 30, 2016.

On November 30, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with ZhongshiFengde to co-purchase copyrights of two TV series with the Company s total investment at RMB 18 million (approximately $2.86 million at the time of investment). On January 28, 2015, both parties agreed to transfer the Company s payment in these two TV series to a short-term loan to Zhongshi Fengde as the copyrights purchase was not successfully completed. As a result, film costs of approximately $2.8 million were reclassified to notes receivable. Since no repayment was collected as of June30, 2016, the Company reserved RMB 9 million (approximately $1,349,447) against the notes receivable. In September 2016, the Company received repayment of RMB 100,000 (approximately $15,002) from Zhongshi Fengde.

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  
   
  Forward Looking Statements  
   
 This quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology including  could ,  may ,  should ,  expect ,  plan ,  anticipate ,  believe ,  estimate ,  predict ,  potential  and the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions. Actual events or results may differ materially. 
   
 While these forward-looking statements, and any assumptions upon which they are based, are made in good faith and reflect our current judgment regarding the direction of our business, actual results will almost always vary, sometimes materially, from any estimates, predictions, projections, assumptions or other future performance suggested in this report. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
  Comparison of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Revenue and Cost  
   
 We had no sales and cost for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  Operating expenses  
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total operating expenses were $38,239, a slight increase of $1,218 as compared to $37,021 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The main increase was relevant to increase in payroll expenses.  
   
  Net income (loss)  

10 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 we incurred a net loss of $42,375. During the same period of 2015 we earned a net income of $25,278.This decrease mainly was the result of decrease in interest income of notes receivable. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 The following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for the periods indicated: 

As of September 30, 2016 we had cash of $26,524 in our bank accounts and a working capital surplus of $2,320,876. 
   
 For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we used net cash of $40,528 in operating activities, compared to net cash received of 842,420 in operating activities during the same period of 2015. The net cash provided by operating activities decrease of $882,948 was mainly due to the decreases in cash received from film costs. 
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we received net cash of $30,004 from investing activities, which came from collection of notes receivable.  
   
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there was no cash used in financing activities, compared to $799,386 in financing activities during the same period in fiscal 2015. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was mainly due to decrease in short-term loan from a related party. 
   
 Our cash level decreased by $10,666 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to an increase of $30,514 in the same period of 2015.The changes in cash were a result of the factors described above. 
   
 We anticipate that we will meet our ongoing cash requirements by retaining income as well as through equity or debt financing. We plan to cooperate with various individuals and institutions to acquire the financing required to produce and distribute our products and anticipate this will continue until we accrue sufficient capital reserves to finance all of our productions independently. 
   
 We intend to meet our cash requirements for the next 12 months through retaining income generated from daily operations and partnerships with finance groups on television and movie projects. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
   
 Please refer to  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our 201610-K for disclosures regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates. The interim financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of computations as those for the year ended June 30, 2016. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

11 

Inflation  
   
 The amounts presented in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments. 
   
  Audit Committee  
   
 The functions of the audit committee are currently carried out by our Board of Directors, who has determined that we do not have an audit committee financial expert on our Board of Directors to carry out the duties of the audit committee. The Board of Directors has determined that the cost of hiring a financial expert to act as a director and to be a member of the audit committee or otherwise perform audit committee functions outweighs the benefits of having a financial expert on the audit committee.

  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
   
 We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. 
   
   Management Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  
   
 Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in Internal Control   Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ). Based on the evaluation performed, our management concluded there are two material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such as that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. 
   
 The material weaknesses relate to 1) the lack of control procedures designed to ensure all the related parties and relationships and the transactions with related parties are identified and properly authorized and approved, 2) the lack of control in place to review the collectability of receivables and to access the necessity to reserve any uncollected amounts. 

12 

Changes in Internal Control  
   
 Except as discussed above, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarterly period that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
