   Summary   
 OceanFirst Financial Corp. is the holding company for OceanFirst Bank (the  Bank ), a community bank headquartered in Ocean County, New Jersey,
serving business and retail customers in the central and southern New Jersey region. The term  Company  refers to OceanFirst Financial Corp., OceanFirst Bank and all of the Bank s subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. The
Company s results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investments, and the interest expense on interest-bearing
liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The Company also generates non-interest income such as income from bankcard services, wealth management, deposit accounts, the sale of investment products, loan originations, loan sales, and other
fees. The Company s operating expenses primarily consist of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment, marketing, Federal deposit insurance, data processing and general and administrative expenses. The Company s
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions, particularly changes in market interest rates, government policies and actions of regulatory agencies.  
 Interest-earning assets, both loans and securities, are generally priced against longer-term indices, while interest-bearing liabilities, primarily deposits
and borrowings, are generally priced against shorter-term indices. The Company has mitigated the adverse impact of low absolute levels of interest rates by growing commercial loans, resulting in a shift in asset mix from lower-yielding
securities into higher-yielding loans. Based upon current economic conditions, characterized by moderate growth and low inflation, interest rates may remain at, or close to, historically low levels with increases in the Federal funds rate expected
to be gradual. The continuation of the low interest rate environment may have an adverse impact on the Company s net interest margin in future periods.  
 In addition to the interest rate environment, the Company s results are affected by economic conditions. Recent economic indicators point to some
improvement in the U.S. economy, which expanded moderately in 2015 and continues to show modest growth again in 2016. Labor market conditions improved as the national unemployment rates in the first nine months of 2016 decreased compared to
prior year levels, while measures of inflation remain subdued.    On May 2, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Cape Bancorp, Inc.
( Cape ), valued at $195 million. The acquisition added 22 new branches, $1.5 billion in total assets, $1.2 billion in loans, and $1.2 billion in deposits. Cape s core systems were integrated on October 15, 2016, providing
for the realization of additional cost savings entering the first quarter of 2017.   Highlights of the Company s financial results and corporate
activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows:    On July 13, 2016, the Company announced it had entered into a definitive
agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which Ocean Shore Holding Company ( Ocean Shore ), the holding company and parent of Ocean City Home Bank, will merge with and into the Company in a transaction valued at approximately $145.6
million. Ocean City Home Bank is one of southern New Jersey s oldest and largest community banks with 11 branches, $1.0 billion in total assets, $807 million in total deposits and $791 million in net loans at June 30, 2016. The
transaction is expected to close on November 30, 2016 subject to certain conditions, including approval by stockholders of each company and customary closing conditions. The Company received the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency on October 27, 2016.    Risk management activities related to recent acquisitions included selling 63 residential loans with a carrying value of
$4.4 million and 72 SBA loans with a carrying value of $8.4 million, which represented the entire SBA portfolio. One additional pool of 58 higher risk commercial loans, with an unpaid balance of $22.7 million, was designated as held for sale
with a targeted closing in the fourth quarter.    Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $9.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, as
compared to net income of $4.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year period. Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes merger related expenses of $1.3 million and $1.0 million,
respectively, which reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.05 and $0.04, respectively. Excluding merger expenses, diluted earnings per share increased over the prior year period due to higher net interest income and other income, partly
offset by higher operating expenses and provision for loan losses.    Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $33.9
million, as compared to $19.6 million for the corresponding prior year period reflecting an increase in interest-earning assets and a higher net interest margin primarily due to the Cape acquisition.  
 Other income increased to $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $4.2 million for the same prior year period. The
increase was primarily due to the impact of the Cape acquisition which added $1.3 million to total other income. Operating expenses, excluding merger related expenses, increased $8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as
compared to the same prior year period primarily due to the operations of Cape and Colonial American Bank ( Colonial American ) (acquired July 31, 2015), which added $7.9 million to operating expenses, as well as the Bank s investment
in commercial lending and the impact of opening new branches.

  The Company remains well-capitalized with a tangible common equity ratio of 8.50% at September 30, 2016. On
July 24, 2014, the Company announced the authorization of the Board of Directors to repurchase up to 5% of the Company s outstanding common stock, or 867,923 shares. No shares were repurchased during the quarter, and 244,804 shares
remained available for repurchase at September 30, 2016.    The Company increased the quarterly per share dividend by 15%, from $0.13 to $0.15. The
dividend is payable on November 18, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of business on November 7, 2016.     Analysis of Net Interest Income
    Net interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest
income depends upon the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the interest rate earned or paid on them.   The
following tables set forth certain information relating to the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or
liabilities, respectively, for the periods shown except where noted otherwise. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. The yields and costs include certain fees which are considered adjustments to yields.

   Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   
 Total assets increased by $1.558 billion to $4.151 billion at September 30, 2016, from $2.593 billion at December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of the Cape
acquisition. Cash, due from banks and interest-bearing deposits increased by $267.6 million, to $311.6 million at September 30, 2016, from $43.9 million at December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to third quarter cash flows
relating to deposit growth, the issuance of subordinated notes and the reduction in loans receivable. Loans receivable, net, increased by $1.058 billion, to $3.029 billion at September 30, 2016, from $1.971 million at December 31,
2015. Excluding the Cape acquisition, loans receivable net, decreased $99.8 million, partly due to the sale and pending sale, of $30.7 million in higher risk loans. As part of the acquisitions of Cape and Colonial American, and the
purchase of an existing retail branch in the Toms River market in the first quarter of 2016, at September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding goodwill of $66.5 million and core deposit intangibles of $3.7 million.  
 Deposits increased by $1.408 billion, to $3.325 billion at September 30, 2016, from $1.917 billion at December 31, 2015, including deposits of $1.248 million
acquired from Cape and $17.0 million acquired through the purchase of an existing retail branch located in the Toms River market. Excluding the Cape acquisition, deposits increased $159.6 million, while core deposits (all deposits excluding
time deposits) increased $178.4 million. The loan-to-deposit ratio at September 30, 2016 was 91.1%, as compared to 102.8% at December 31, 2015. The deposit growth funded a decrease in Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances of
$73.3 million, to $251.1 million at September 30, 2016, from $324.4 million at December 31, 2015. The increase in other borrowings relates to the September 2016 issuance of $35.0 million in subordinated notes at an initial rate of 5.125% and a
stated maturity of September 30, 2026.    Stockholders  equity increased to $417.2 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to $238.4 million at
December 31, 2015. The acquisition of Cape added $165.9 million to stockholders  equity. At September 30, 2016, there were 244,804 shares available for repurchase under the stock repurchase program adopted in July of
2014. Tangible stockholders  equity per common share decreased to $13.42 at September 30, 2016, as compared to $13.67 at December 31, 2015, due to the addition of intangible assets in the Cape acquisition.  
  Comparison of Operating Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   
  General     On July 31, 2015, the Company completed its
acquisition of Colonial American, which added $142.4 million to assets, $121.2 million to loans, and $123.3 million to deposits. Colonial American s results of operations are included in the consolidated results for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, however in 2015, Colonial American is only included in the results of operations for the period from August 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015.  
 On May 2, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Cape, which added $1.5 billion to assets, $1.2 billion to loans and $1.2 billion to
deposits. Cape s results of operations from May 2, 2016 through September 30, 2016 are included in the consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, but are excluded from the results of operations for the
corresponding prior year periods.    Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $9.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, as compared to
net income of $4.7 million, or $0.28 per diluted share for the corresponding prior year period. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $17.0 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $15.1 million, or
$0.90 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year period. Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes merger related expenses of $1.3 million, and $9.9 million, respectively, as compared to merger related
expenses of $1.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the same prior year periods. In connection with the Cape acquisition, the Bank deleveraged the combined balance sheet through the sale of lower-yielding securities and the prepayment
of existing term borrowings in order to improve the net interest margin, reduce interest rate sensitivity, and increase capital ratios. The implementation of this strategy resulted in a second quarter expense of $136,000 relating to the
prepayment of FHLB advances and a loss of $12,000 on the sale of investment securities available-for-sale (the  deleveraging costs ). The after-tax impact of merger related expenses and the deleveraging costs reduced diluted earnings
per share by $0.05 and $0.34 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and by $0.04 and $0.06 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Excluding the merger related expenses and the
deleveraging costs, diluted earnings per share increased over the prior year periods due to higher net interest income and other income, partly offset by higher operating expenses and provision for loan losses.

   Interest Income   
 Interest income for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $37.3 million and $93.5 million, respectively, as compared to $22.0
million and $62.7 million, respectively, in the corresponding prior year periods. Average interest-earning assets increased $1,388.3 million and $909.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to the same prior year periods. The averages for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were favorably impacted by $1,233.7 million and $776.7 million, respectively, as a result of the interest-earning assets acquired from Cape and
Colonial American ( Acquisition Transactions ). Average loans receivable, net, increased $1,210.2 million and $833.9 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same prior year
periods. The increases in average loans receivable, net, attributable to the Acquisition Transactions were $1,198.7 million and $723.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The yield on average
interest-earning assets increased to 3.92% and 3.88%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 3.63%, in both corresponding prior year periods. The yields on average interest-earning assets for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 benefited from the accretion of purchase accounting adjustments, the higher-yielding interest-earning assets acquired from Cape, and the change in the average balance sheet mix in favor of higher-yielding
loans receivable at the expense of lower-yielding securities.     Interest Expense   
 Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3.4 million and $9.0 million, respectively, as compared to $2.4 million and $6.6
million, respectively, in the corresponding prior year periods. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities decreased to 0.43% and 0.46%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 0.50% and 0.47%,
respectively, for the prior year periods benefiting from the change in mix to lower-cost deposits from higher-cost borrowings. The total cost of deposits (including non-interest-bearing deposits) was 0.25% for both the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 0.24% and 0.23% for the corresponding prior year periods.     Net Interest Income   
 Net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $33.9 million and $84.5 million, respectively, as compared to $19.6
million and $56.1 million, respectively, in the corresponding prior year periods, reflecting an increase in interest-earning assets and a higher net interest margin. Average interest-earning assets increased $1,388.3 million and $909.8 million,
respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same prior year periods. The averages for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, were favorably impacted by $1,233.7 million and $776.7
million, respectively, as a result of the interest-earning assets from the Acquisition Transactions. The net interest margin increased to 3.56% and 3.51%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to
3.24% and 3.25%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Included in net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, is $1.6 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of net accretion of
purchase accounting adjustments, as compared to $140,000 for both the corresponding prior year periods.     Provision for Loan Losses   
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the provision for loan losses was $888,000 and $2.1 million, respectively, as compared to $300,000 and
$975,000, respectively, for the corresponding prior year periods. Net charge-offs were $1.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net charge-offs of $196,000 and $654,000,
respectively, in the corresponding prior year periods. The increase in net charge-offs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to third quarter charge-offs of $1.6 million on loans sold or held for sale at
September 30, 2016, and to a lesser extent, first quarter charge-offs of $886,000 on two non-performing commercial loans. Of the $1.6 million in third quarter charge-offs, $1.1 million was related to a pool of higher risk commercial loans
designated as held for sale at September 30, 2016 with an unpaid principal balance of $22.7 million and with a specific allocation in the allowance for loan losses of $916,000. This pool of loans is expected to be sold in the fourth
quarter. Non-performing loans decreased to $16.5 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to $18.3 million at December 31, 2015. The non-performing loan amount at September 30, 2016 includes $3.2 million of loans held for sale which have
been marked down to fair value.     Other Income     For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, other income increased to $5.9 million and $14.2 million, respectively, as compared to $4.2 million and $12.3 million, respectively, in the same prior year periods. The increases from the
prior periods were primarily due to the impact of the Cape acquisition which added $1.3 million and $2.2 million to total other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same prior year
periods. Excluding Cape, other income increased $452,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and decreased $396,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same prior year periods. For the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, other income included a gain of $125,000 and a loss of $292,000, respectively, attributable to the operations of a hotel, golf and banquet facility acquired as

Other Real Estate Owned ( OREO ) in the fourth quarter of 2015. The Bank is currently engaged in a sales process with qualified buyers for this property. The results for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 included no gains on the sale of loan servicing, as compared to $111,000 in the prior year period.     Operating
Expenses     Operating expenses increased to $25.0 million and $70.4 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as
compared to $16.1 million and $44.3 million, respectively, in the same prior year periods. Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 include $1.3 million and $9.9 million, respectively, in merger related
expenses, as compared to merger related expenses of $1.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively, in the prior year periods. Excluding merger related expenses, the increases in operating expenses over the prior year were primarily due to the
operations of Cape and Colonial American, which added $7.9 million and $13.7 million for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively; the investment in commercial lending which added expenses of $21,000 and $822,000 for the quarter and year-to-date,
respectively; the addition of new branches which added expenses of $269,000 and $991,000 for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively; and the FHLB advance prepayment fee of $136,000. 
  Provision for Income Taxes     The provision for income
taxes was $4.8 million and $9.2 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2.6 million and $8.1 million, respectively, for the same prior year periods. The effective tax rate was 34.4% and
35.0%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 35.5% and 34.9%, respectively, for the same prior year periods. The variances in the effective tax rate were primarily due to the timing of
non-deductible merger related expenses.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 The Company s primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, proceeds from the sale of
loans, FHLB and other borrowings and, to a lesser extent, investment maturities. While scheduled amortization of loans is a predictable source of funds, deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by interest rates, economic
conditions and competition. The Company has other sources of liquidity if a need for additional funds arises.    At September 30, 2016, the Company had
no outstanding overnight borrowings from the FHLB as compared to $82.0 million outstanding at December 31, 2015. The Company utilizes overnight borrowings to fund short-term liquidity needs. The Company had total FHLB borrowings, including
the overnight borrowings, of $251.1 million and $324.4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.    The Company s cash needs
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were primarily satisfied by principal payments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale and the sale of higher risk loans, proceeds from maturities
and calls of investment securities, proceeds from sale of available-for-sale securities, deposit growth and the issuance of subordinated notes. The cash was principally utilized for loan originations, the purchase of loans receivable, and to
reduce borrowings. The Company s cash needs for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were primarily satisfied by principal payments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans held for sale,
proceeds from maturities of investment securities and deposit growth. The cash was principally utilized for loan originations, the purchase of loans receivable, the purchase of investment securities and to reduce FHLB borrowings.  
 In the normal course of business, the Company routinely enters into various off-balance-sheet commitments. At September 30, 2016, outstanding undrawn
lines of credit totaled $486.2 million; outstanding commitments to originate loans totaled $109.3 million; and outstanding commitments to sell loans totaled $10.1 million. The Company expects to have sufficient funds available to meet current
commitments arising in the normal course of business.    Time deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less totaled $258.1 million at September 30,
2016. Based upon historical experience, management estimates that a significant portion of such time deposits will remain with the Company.    The
Company has a detailed contingency funding plan and comprehensive reporting of funding trends on a monthly and quarterly basis which are reviewed by management. Management also monitors cash on a daily basis to determine the liquidity needs of the
Bank. Additionally, management performs multiple liquidity stress test scenarios on a quarterly basis. The Bank continues to maintain significant liquidity under all stress scenarios.

  Under the Company s common stock repurchase program, shares of OceanFirst Financial Corp. common stock may
be purchased in the open market and through privately-negotiated transactions, from time-to-time, depending on market conditions. The repurchased shares are held as treasury stock for general corporate purposes. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company did not repurchase any shares of common stock as compared to repurchases of 373,594 shares at a cost of $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, there were 244,804 shares
available to be repurchased under the stock repurchase program authorized in July of 2014.    Cash dividends on common stock declared and paid during the
first nine months of 2016 were $8.8 million, as compared to $6.5 million in the same prior year period. The increase in dividends was a result of the additional shares issued in the Cape and Colonial American acquisitions. On October 19,
2016, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of fifteen cents ($0.15) per common share, an increase of $0.02 from the linked quarter. The dividend is payable on November 18, 2016 to stockholders of record at the close of
business on November 7, 2016.    The primary sources of liquidity specifically available to OceanFirst Financial Corp., the holding company of OceanFirst
Bank, are capital distributions from the bank subsidiary and the issuance of preferred and common stock and debt. In September 2016, the Company issued $35.0 million in subordinated notes at an initial rate of 5.125% and a stated maturity of
September 30, 2026. At December 31, 2015, the Company had received notice from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia that it does not object to the payment of $12.0 million in dividends from the Bank to the Company over the next three
quarters of 2016, although the Federal Reserve Bank reserved the right to revoke the approval at any time if a safety and soundness concern arises. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received a dividend payment of $4.0
million from the Bank and $8.0 million remained to be paid. The Bank elected not to pay dividends during the second and third quarters of 2016 in order to retain capital subsequent to the Cape acquisition. The Company s ability to
continue to pay dividends will be largely dependent upon capital distributions from the Bank, which may be adversely affected by capital constraints imposed by the applicable regulations. The Company cannot predict whether the Bank will be
permitted under applicable regulations to pay a dividend to the Company. If the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the Company, the Company may not have the liquidity necessary to pay a dividend in the future or pay a dividend at the same rate
as historically paid, or be able to meet current debt obligations. At September 30, 2016, OceanFirst Financial Corp. held $46.8 million in cash.    As
of September 30, 2016, the Company and the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements as follows (in thousands):      

(1) 
 Includes capital conservation buffer.      The Company and the Bank are considered  well-capitalized 
under the Prompt Corrective Action Regulations.    At September 30, 2016, the Company maintained tangible common equity of $347.0 million, for a tangible
common equity to assets ratio of 8.50%.     Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations   
 In the normal course of operations, the Company engages in a variety of financial transactions that, in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, are not recorded in the financial statements. These transactions involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Such transactions are used for general corporate purposes or for customer
needs. Corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit, interest rate and liquidity risk or to optimize capital. Customer transactions are used to manage customers  requests for funding. These financial instruments
and commitments include undrawn lines of credit and commitments to extend credit. The Company also has outstanding commitments to sell loans amounting to $10.1 million at September 30, 2016.

  The following table shows the contractual obligations of the Company by expected payment period as of September
30, 2016 (in thousands):      
   Commitments to fund undrawn lines of credit and commitments to originate loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as
there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire
without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company s exposure to credit risk is represented by the contractual amount of the instruments.  
  Non-Performing Assets     The following table sets forth
information regarding the Company s non-performing assets consisting of non-performing loans and OREO. It is the policy of the Company to cease accruing interest on loans 90 days or more past due or in the process of foreclosure.  
   
   The Company s non-performing loans totaled $16.5 million at September 30, 2016, as compared to $18.3 million at December
31, 2015. Included in the non-performing loans total at September 30, 2016 was $3.5 million of troubled debt restructured ( TDR ) loans, as compared to $4.9 million of TDR loans at December 31, 2015. The decrease in commercial
real estate   owner occupied was primarily due to payoffs and loans returning to accrual status. Non-performing loans do not include $5.8 million of PCI loans acquired from Cape and Colonial American. At September 30, 2016, the
allowance for loan losses totaled $15.6 million, or 0.51% of total loans, as compared to $16.7 million, or 0.84% of total loans at December 31, 2015. These ratios exclude existing fair value credit marks of $17.1 million at September 30, 2016
on the Cape and Colonial American loans and $2.2 million at December 31, 2015 on the Colonial American loans. These loans were acquired at fair value with no related allowances for loan losses. OREO includes $7.0 million relating to the
hotel, golf and banquet facility located in New Jersey which the Company acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015.

Table of Contents  

  The Company classifies loans and other assets in accordance with regulatory guidelines as follows (in thousands):
     
   The increase in substandard and special mention loans is primarily a result of the re-grading of the Cape loan portfolio using
the Bank s risk rating scale. The classification downgrades are consistent with the Company s due diligence findings prior to the acquisition and reflective of the credit mark at the time of acquisition. The largest substandard
loan relationship is comprised of several credit facilities to a marina with an aggregate balance of $5.2 million. The loans are well collateralized by commercial and residential real estate, all business assets and also carry a personal
guarantee. The largest special mention loan is a $7.8 million facility to a marina that is well secured by the marina and related commercial and residential real estate.  
  Critical Accounting Policies     Note 1 to the
Company s Audited Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ), as supplemented by this
report, contains a summary of significant accounting policies. Various elements of these accounting policies, by their nature, are inherently subject to estimation techniques, valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments. Certain
assets are carried in the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Policies with respect to the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses and judgments regarding
securities and goodwill impairment are the most critical accounting policies because they are important to the presentation of the Company s financial condition and results of operations. These judgments and policies involve a higher
degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters. The use of different judgments, assumptions and estimates could result in
material differences in the results of operations or financial condition. Goodwill will be evaluated for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment between annual
measurement dates. These critical accounting policies and their application are reviewed periodically and, at least annually, with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.  
  Private Securities Litigation Reform Act Safe Harbor Statement   
 In addition to historical information, this quarterly report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995 which are based on certain assumptions and describe future plans, strategies and expectations of the Company. These forward-looking statements are generally identified by use of the words  believe, 
 expect,   intend,   anticipate,   estimate,   project,   will,   should,   may,   view,   opportunity,   potential,  or similar
expressions or expressions of confidence. The Company s ability to predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on the operations of the
Company and its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates, general economic conditions, levels of unemployment in the Bank s lending area, real estate market values in the Bank s lending area, future natural
disasters and increases to flood insurance premiums, the level of prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities, legislative/regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. Government including policies of the U.S. Treasury and
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the quality or composition of the loan or investment portfolios, demand for loan products, deposit flows, competition, demand for financial services in the Company s market area and
accounting principles and guidelines. These risks and uncertainties are further discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and subsequent securities filings and should be considered in
evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. The Company does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the result of any revisions which may be made to
any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events. Further description of the risks and uncertainties to the business are
included in Item 1, Business, and Item 1A, Risk Factors, of the Company s 2015 Form 10-K and Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this 10-Q.      

Item 3.  
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      The Company s interest rate sensitivity
is monitored through the use of an interest rate risk ( IRR ) model. The following table sets forth the amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities outstanding at September 30, 2016, which were anticipated by
the Company, based upon certain assumptions, to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown.

Table of Contents  

  At September 30, 2016, the Company s one-year gap was positive 1.32% as compared to negative 1.71% at
December 31, 2015.      

(1) 
 Interest-earning assets are included in the period in which the balances are expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of anticipated prepayments, scheduled rate adjustments, and contractual maturities.

(2) 
 For purposes of the gap analysis, loans receivable includes loans held for sale and non-performing loans gross of the allowance for loan losses, unamortized discounts and deferred loan fees.    

(3) 
 Interest sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.    
 Additionally, the table below sets forth the Company s exposure to IRR as measured by the change in economic value of equity ( EVE ) and net
interest income under varying rate shocks as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. All methods used to measure interest rate sensitivity involve the use of assumptions, which may tend to oversimplify the manner in which actual yields and
costs respond to changes in market interest rates. The Company s interest rate sensitivity should be reviewed in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the 2015 Form 10-K.  
   
   The decrease in interest rate sensitivity in a rising interest rate scenario at September 30, 2016, as compared to December
31, 2015, is primarily due to the increase in interest-earning deposits of $252.4 million.

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures       The Company s management, including the Company s principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, (the  Exchange Act ). Based upon their evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures were effective. Disclosure controls and procedures are the controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under
the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) (1) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and (2) is accumulated and communicated to the
Company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In addition, based on that evaluation, there were no changes in the
Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

   Note 1. Basis of Presentation      The accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of OceanFirst Financial Corp. (the  Company ) and its wholly-owned subsidiary, OceanFirst Bank (the  Bank ), and its subsidiaries.  
 The interim consolidated financial statements reflect all normal and recurring adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, considered necessary for a
fair presentation of the financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that
may be expected for all of 2016. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the statements of
financial condition and the results of operations for the period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.    Certain information and note
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
 SEC ).    These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and
notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report to Stockholders on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.      Note 2. Business
Combinations        Branch Acquisition      On
March 11, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of an existing retail branch in the Toms River market. Under the terms of the Purchase and Assumption Agreement dated July 31, 2015, the Company paid a deposit premium of $340,000, equal to
2.50% of core deposits; i.e., all deposits other than time deposits, government deposits, and fiduciary accounts. Up to 1.0% of the deposit premium was contingent on the core deposit balance seventy-five days after closing.  
 The branch acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Assets acquired, liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were
recorded at their respective acquisition date fair values. Determining the fair value of assets and liabilities is a complicated process involving significant judgment regarding methods and assumptions used to calculate estimated fair
values. Fair values are preliminary and subject to refinement for up to one year after the closing date as additional information regarding the acquisition date fair values becomes available.  
 The following table presents the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of March 11, 2016 and the initial fair value estimates (in thousands):

    Cape Bancorp Acquisition    
 On May 2, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Cape Bancorp, Inc. ( Cape ), which after purchase accounting adjustments added $1.5 billion
to assets, $1.2 billion to loans, and $1.2 billion to deposits. Total consideration paid for Cape was $196.4 million, including cash consideration of $30.5 million. Cape was merged with and into the Company as of the date of acquisition.
   The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, the purchase price has been allocated to
the respective assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values, net of tax. The excess of consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired has been recorded as goodwill.  
 The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the date of the acquisition for Cape, net of
total consideration paid (in thousands):      

(A) 
 Represents accrued liability related to the Pension Plan.      The calculation of goodwill is subject to change
for up to one year after the date of acquisition as additional information relative to the closing date estimates and uncertainties becomes available. As the Company finalizes its review of the acquired assets and liabilities, certain
adjustments to the recorded carrying values may be required.

   Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information   
 The following table presents financial information regarding the former Cape operations included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of the
acquisition (May 2, 2016) through September 30, 2016. In addition, the table provides unaudited condensed pro forma financial information assuming the Cape acquisition had been completed as of January 1, 2016, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, and as of January 1, 2015, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The table below has been prepared for comparative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the actual results that would have been attained
had the acquisition occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented, nor is it indicative of future results. Furthermore, the unaudited pro forma information does not reflect management s estimate of any revenue-enhancing
opportunities nor anticipated cost savings or the impact of conforming certain accounting policies of the acquired company to the Company s policies that may have occurred as a result of the integration and consolidation of Cape s
operations. The pro forma information shown reflects adjustments related to certain purchase accounting fair value adjustments; amortization of core deposit and other intangibles; and related income tax effects.  
   
    Fair Value Measurement of Assets Assumed and Liabilities Assumed   
 The methods used to determine the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Cape acquisition were as follows. Refer to Note 9, Fair
Value Measurements, for a discussion of the fair value hierarchy.     Securities   
 The estimated fair values of the securities were calculated utilizing Level 2 inputs. The securities acquired are bought and sold in active
markets. Prices for these instruments were obtained through security industry sources that actively participate in the buying and selling of securities.  
  Loans     The acquired loan portfolio was valued utilizing
Level 3 inputs and included the use of present value techniques employing cash flow estimates and incorporated assumptions that marketplace participants would use in estimating fair values. In instances where reliable market information was not
available, the Company used its own assumptions in an effort to determine reasonable fair value. Specifically, the Company utilized three separate fair value analyses which a market participant would employ in estimating the total fair value
adjustment. The three separate fair valuation methodologies used were: 1) interest rate loan fair value analysis; 2) general credit fair value adjustment; and 3) specific credit fair value adjustment.  
 To prepare the interest rate fair value analysis, loans were grouped by characteristics such as loan type, term, collateral and rate. Market rates for
similar loans were obtained from various external data sources and reviewed by Company management for reasonableness. The average of these rates was used as the fair value interest rate a market participant would utilize. A present value
approach was utilized to calculate the interest rate fair value adjustment.    The general credit fair value adjustment was calculated using a two part
general credit fair value analysis: 1) expected lifetime losses and 2) estimated fair value adjustment for qualitative factors. The expected lifetime losses were calculated using an average of historical losses of the acquired bank. The
adjustment related to qualitative factors was impacted by general economic conditions and the risk related to lack of experience with the originator s underwriting process.  
      21  

Table of Contents  

OceanFirst Financial Corp.   
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
   
  To calculate the specific credit fair value adjustment, the Company reviewed the acquired loan portfolio for
loans meeting the definition of an impaired loan with deteriorated credit quality. Loans meeting these criteria were reviewed by comparing the contractual cash flows to expected collectible cash flows. The aggregate expected cash flows
less the acquisition date fair value resulted in an accretable yield amount which will be recognized over the life of the loans on a level yield basis as an adjustment to yield.  
  Premises and Equipment     Fair values are based upon
appraisals from independent third parties. In addition to owned properties, Cape operated eight properties subject to lease agreements.     Deposits
and Core Deposit Premium     Core deposit premium represents the value assigned to non-interest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing checking, money
market and saving accounts acquired as part of the acquisition. The core deposit premium value represents the future economic benefit, including the present value of future tax benefits, of the potential cost saving from acquiring the core
deposits as part of an acquisition compared to the cost of alternative funding sources and is valued utilizing Level 2 inputs.    Time deposits are not
considered to be core deposits as they are assumed to have a low expected average life upon acquisition. The fair value of time deposits represents the present value of the expected contractual payments discounted by market rates for similar
time deposits and is valued utilizing Level 2 inputs.     Borrowings   
 Fair value estimates are based on discounting contractual cash flows using rates which approximate the rates offered for borrowings of similar remaining
maturities.      Note 3. Earnings per Share      The
following reconciles shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands):      
   For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, antidilutive stock options of 914,000 and 1,064,000, respectively,
were excluded from earnings per share calculations. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, antidilutive stock options of 1,132,000 and 740,000, respectively, were excluded from earnings per share calculations.

  During the third quarter 2013, the Bank transferred $536.0 million of previously designated
available-for-sale securities to a held-to-maturity designation at estimated fair value. The securities transferred had an unrealized net loss of $13.3 million at the time of transfer which continues to be reflected in accumulated other
comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet, net of subsequent amortization, which is being recognized over the life of the securities. The carrying value of the held-to-maturity investment securities at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 are as follows (in thousands):      
   There were $75,000 in realized gains and $87,000 in realized losses on the sale of available-for-sale securities for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. There were no realized gains or losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016. There were no realized gains or losses on the sale of securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.
   The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities at September 30, 2016 by contractual maturity are shown below (in thousands). Actual
maturities will differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. At September 30, 2016, corporate debt securities with an amortized cost of $60.5
million and estimated fair value of $53.5 million were callable prior to the maturity date.      
   Other investments which consist of two open-end funds are excluded from the above table since there are no contractual
maturity dates. Mortgage-backed securities are excluded from the above table since their effective lives are expected to be shorter than the contractual maturity date due to principal prepayments.  
 The estimated fair value and unrealized loss of securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, segregated by

  At September 30, 2016, the estimated fair value of each of the above corporate debt securities was below
cost. However, the estimated fair value of these corporate debt securities has steadily increased over the past several years. These corporate debt securities are issued by other financial institutions with credit ratings ranging from a
high of A1 to a low of BB as rated by one of the internationally-recognized credit rating services. These floating-rate corporate debt securities were purchased in 1998 and have paid coupon interest continuously since
issuance. Floating-rate corporate debt securities such as these pay a fixed interest rate spread over 90-day LIBOR. Following the purchase of these securities, the required interest rate spread increased for these types of securities
causing a decline in the market price. The Company concluded that unrealized losses on these corporate debt securities were only temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016. In concluding that the impairments were only temporary, the
Company considered several factors in its analysis. The Company noted that each issuer made all the contractually due payments when required. There were no defaults on principal or interest payments and no interest payments were deferred.
All of the financial institutions are also considered well-capitalized. Interest rate spreads have now decreased for these types of securities and market prices have improved. Based on management s analysis of each individual
security, the issuers appear to have the ability to meet debt service requirements over the life of the security. Furthermore, the Company does not have the intent to sell these securities and it is more likely than not that the Company will
not be required to sell the securities. The Company has held the securities continuously since 1998 and expects to receive its full principal at maturity in 2028 or prior if called by the issuer. Historically, the Company has not utilized
securities sales as a source of liquidity. The Company s long range liquidity plans indicate adequate sources of liquidity outside the securities portfolio.  
 The mortgage-backed securities are issued and guaranteed by either the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ( FHLMC ) or Federal National Mortgage
Association ( FNMA ), corporations which are chartered by the United States Government and whose debt obligations are typically rated AA+ by one of the internationally-recognized credit rating services. The Company considers the
unrealized losses to be the result of changes in interest rates which over time can have both a positive and negative impact on the estimated fair value of the mortgage-backed securities. The Company does not intend to sell these securities and
it is more likely than not that the Company will not be required to sell the securities before recovery of their amortized cost. As a result, the Company concluded that these securities were only temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.

  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, loans in the amount of $16.5 million and $18.3 million,
respectively, were three or more months delinquent or in the process of foreclosure and the Company was not accruing interest income on these loans. There were no loans ninety days or greater past due and still accruing
interest. Non-accrual loans include both smaller balance homogenous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans.  
 The recorded investment in mortgage and consumer loans collateralized by residential real estate which are in the process of foreclosure amounted to $3.7
million at September 30, 2016. The amount of foreclosed residential real estate property held by the Company was $1.8 million at September 30, 2016.  
 The Company defines an impaired loan as all non-accrual commercial real estate, multi-family, land, construction and commercial loans in excess of
$250,000. Impaired loans also include all loans modified as troubled debt restructurings. At September 30, 2016, the impaired loan portfolio totaled $34.9 million for which there was a specific allocation in the allowance for loan losses
of $269,000. At December 31, 2015, the impaired loan portfolio totaled $38.4 million for which there was a specific allocation in the allowance for loan losses of $1.3 million. The average balance of impaired loans for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $34.5 million and $34.3 million, respectively, and $46.2 million and $40.9 million, respectively, for the same prior year periods.

  The following table presents the aging of the recorded investment in past due loans as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 by loan portfolio segment, excluding PCI loans (in thousands):      
   The Company categorizes all commercial and commercial real estate loans, except for small business loans, into risk categories
based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company uses
the following definitions for risk ratings:     Special Mention . Loans classified as Special Mention have a potential weakness
that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the Bank s credit position at some future date.  
  Substandard . Loans classified as Substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the
borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain
some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.     Doubtful . Loans classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those
classified as Substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.  
  Pass . Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process.

  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk
category of loans by loan portfolio segment follows, excluding PCI loans (in thousands). The increase in substandard and special mention loans is primarily a result of the re-grading of the Cape loan portfolio using the Bank s risk rating
scale. The classification downgrades are consistent with the Company s due diligence findings prior to the acquisition and reflective of the credit mark at the time of acquisition.  
   
   For residential and consumer loan classes, the Company evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan, which
was previously presented, and by payment activity. The following table presents the recorded investment in residential and consumer loans based on payment activity as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, excluding PCI loans (in
thousands):      
   The Company classifies certain loans as troubled debt restructurings when credit terms to a borrower in financial difficulty
are modified. The modifications may include a reduction in rate, an extension in term, the capitalization of past due amounts and/or the restructuring of scheduled principal payments. Included in the non-accrual loan total at September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015 were $3.5 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of troubled debt restructurings. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has allocated $30,000 and $262,000, respectively, of specific reserves to
loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings. Non-accrual loans which become troubled debt restructurings are generally returned to accrual status after six months of performance. In addition to the troubled debt restructurings
included in non-accrual loans, the Company also has loans classified as troubled debt restructurings which are accruing at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which totaled $26.4 million and $26.3 million, respectively. Troubled debt
restructurings are considered in the allowance for loan losses similar to other impaired loans.

    Note 8. Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
 In September 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU  or  Update )
2015-16,  Business Combinations, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement   Period Adjustments.  The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that have reported provisional amounts for items in a business combination for
which the accounting is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs and during the measurement period have an adjustment to provisional amounts recognized. In these cases, the acquirer must record, in the same
period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the
acquisition date. The amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this Update did not have a material impact on the
Company s consolidated financial statements.    In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic
825-10) Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The main objective in developing this new ASU is to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with
more useful information. The update requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. It simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable
fair values by requiring a quantitative assessment to identify impairment. The amendment eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is
required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. It requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure
purposes. Financial assets and financial liabilities are to be presented separately by measurement category and the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities should be evaluated with other
deferred tax assets. The amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact
on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  This ASU
requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new
guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective approach must be applied for
leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company s consolidated
financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718).  The objective of
the Update is to simplify accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under the Update, all
excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be
treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. An entity can make an entity-wide
accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current accounting) or account for forfeitures when they occur. Within the Cash Flow Statement, excess tax benefits should be classified along with
other income tax cash flows as an operating activity, and cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. The amendments in this Update are effective for
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial
Instruments.  This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income. The standard will replace
today s  incurred loss  approach with an  expected loss  model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses
and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply
to available-for-sale ( AFS ) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances
rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. The ASU also
simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and
lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for interim and
annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect
adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach). The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 to determine the
potential impact the new standard will have on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.    In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . This ASU is intended to reduce diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement
of cash flows. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted, including adoption in an interim period. A retrospective transition method should be applied to each period presented, unless
it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, then the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently assessing the impact that the
guidance will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.      Note 9. Fair Value Measurements    
 Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants. A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or in the absence of a principal market, the most advantageous market for the
asset or liability. The price in the principal (or the most advantageous) market used to measure the fair value of the asset or liability shall not be adjusted for transaction costs. An orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to
the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. Market participants are buyers and sellers
in the principal market that are (i) independent, (ii) knowledgeable, (iii) able to transact and (iv) willing to transact.    The Company uses valuation
techniques that are consistent with the market approach, the income approach and/or the cost approach. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and
liabilities. The income approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts, such as cash flows or earnings, to a single present amount on a discounted basis. The cost approach is based on the amount that currently would be required to
replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement costs). Valuation techniques should be consistently applied. Inputs to valuation techniques refer to the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Inputs
may be observable, meaning those that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and developed based on market data obtained from independent sources, or unobservable, meaning those that reflect the
reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability and developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. In that regard, a fair value hierarchy has been
established for valuation inputs that give the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. Movements within the fair value hierarchy are recognized at
the end of the applicable reporting period. There were no transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The fair value hierarchy is as follows:  
 Level 1 Inputs   Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at
the measurement date.  
      37  

Table of Contents  

OceanFirst Financial Corp.   
  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)   
   
  Level 2 Inputs   Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset
or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted
prices that are observable for the asset or liability (for example, interest rates, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and default rates) or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
data by correlations or other means.    Level 3 Inputs   Significant unobservable inputs that reflect an entity s own assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the assets or liabilities.      Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value    
 A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments
pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is set forth below. Certain financial assets and financial liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are
subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances (for example, when there is evidence of impairment).     Securities Available-For-Sale   
 Securities classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs. In general, fair value is based upon quoted market
prices, where available. Most of the Company s available-for-sale securities, however, are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are bought and sold in active markets. Prices for these instruments are obtained
through third party pricing vendors or security industry sources that actively participate in the buying and selling of securities. Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations and matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical
technique used principally to value certain securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but comparing the securities to benchmark or comparable securities.  
  Other Real Estate Owned and Impaired Loans     Other real
estate owned and loans measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral are recorded at estimated fair value, less estimated selling costs. Fair value is based on independent appraisals.  
 The following table summarizes financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, segregated by

    Assets and Liabilities Disclosed at Fair Value    
 A description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities disclosed at fair value, as well as the general classification of such instruments
pursuant to the valuation hierarchy is set forth below.     Cash and Due from Banks   
 For cash and due from banks, the carrying amount approximates fair value.  
  Securities Held-to-Maturity     Securities classified as
held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, as the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. The Company determines the fair value of the securities utilizing Level 2 inputs. In general, fair
value is based upon quoted market prices, where available. Most of the Company s investment and mortgage-backed securities, however, are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are bought and sold in active
markets. Prices for these instruments are obtained through third party pricing vendors or security industry sources that actively participate in the buying and selling of securities. Prices obtained from these sources include market quotations
and matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used principally to value certain securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities, but comparing the securities to benchmark or comparable
securities.    Fair value estimates are made at a point in time, based on relevant market data as well as the best information available about the security.
Illiquid credit markets have resulted in inactive markets for certain of the Company s securities. As a result, there is limited observable market data for these assets. Fair value estimates for securities for which limited observable
market data is available are based on judgments regarding current economic conditions, liquidity discounts, credit and interest rate risks, and other factors. These estimates involve significant uncertainties and judgments and cannot be
determined with precision. As a result, such calculated fair value estimates may not be realizable in a current sale or immediate settlement of the security.  
 The Company utilizes third party pricing services to obtain fair values for its corporate debt securities. Management s policy is to obtain and
review all available documentation from the third party pricing service relating to their fair value determinations, including their methodology and summary of inputs. Management reviews this documentation, makes inquiries of the third party
pricing service and makes a determination as to the level of the valuation inputs. Based on the Company s review of the available documentation from the third party pricing service, management concluded that Level 2 inputs were utilized
for all securities. In the case of the Level 2 securities, the significant observable inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, other market
information and observations of equity and credit default swap curves related to the issuer.     Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock   
 The fair value for Federal Home Loan Bank of New York stock is its carrying value since this is the amount for which it could be redeemed. There is no active
market for this stock and the Company is required to maintain a minimum investment based upon the outstanding balance of mortgage related assets and outstanding borrowings.  
  Loans     Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans
with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type such as residential mortgage, consumer and commercial. Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms.  
 Fair value of performing and non-performing loans was estimated by discounting the future cash flows, net of estimated prepayments, at a rate for which
similar loans would be originated to new borrowers with similar terms. Fair values estimated in this manner do not fully incorporate an exit price approach to fair value, but instead are based on a comparison to current market rates for comparable
loans.

   Deposits Other than Time Deposits   
 The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest-bearing demand deposits, interest-bearing checking accounts, money market accounts and
saving accounts are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand. The related insensitivity of the majority of these deposits to interest rate changes creates a significant inherent value which is not reflected in the fair value reported.
    Time Deposits     The fair value of time deposits is
based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.  
  Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase with Retail Customers   
 Fair value approximates the carrying amount as these borrowings are payable on demand and the interest rate adjusts monthly.  
  Borrowed Funds     Fair value estimates are based on
discounting contractual cash flows using rates which approximate the rates offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities.    The book value and
estimated fair value of the Bank s significant financial instruments not recorded at fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are presented in the following tables (in thousands):

   Limitations   
 Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument. These estimates
do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because a limited market exists for a significant portion of the Company s
financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other significant unobservable inputs. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.  
 Fair value estimates are based on existing balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to estimate the value of anticipated future business and the
value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets or liabilities include deferred tax assets, and premises and equipment. In addition, the tax
ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in the estimates.
