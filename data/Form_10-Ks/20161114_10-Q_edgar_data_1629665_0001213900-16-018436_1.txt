1   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)   

January
27, 2015, Muliang HK incorporated a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, Shanghai Mufeng Investment Consulting Co., Ltd ( Shanghai
Mufeng ), in the People's Republic of China ( PRC ).  

On
July 8, 2015, Mullan Agritech entered into certain stock purchase agreement with Muliang Agriculture, Inc., pursuant to which
Mullan Agritech, for a consideration of $5,000, acquired 100% interest in Muliang HK and its wholly-owned subsidiary Shanghai

On
July 23, 2015, Muliang Industry established a wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai Muliang Agricultural Sales Co., Ltd. ( Muliang
Sales ) in Shanghai, China.  

On
September 3, 2015, Mullan Agritech effected a split of its outstanding common stock resulting in an aggregate of 150,525,000 shares
outstanding of which 120,000,000 were owned by Chenxi Shi the founder of Mullan Agritech and its sole officer and director. The
remaining 30,525,000 were held by a total of 39 investors.  

On

Agreements, including (1) Exclusive Technical Consulting and Service Agreement, (2) Equity Pledge Agreement, and (3) Call Option
Cooperation Agreement, with Muliang Industry, and its Principal Shareholders. As a result of the Stock Purchase Agreement and
the set of VIE Agreements, Shanghai Muliang Industry Co., Ltd., along with its consolidated subsidiaries, became entities controlled
by Mullan Agritech whereby Mullan Agritech would derive all substantial economic benefit generated by Muliang Industry and its
subsidiaries.  

As
a result, Mullan Agritech has a direct wholly-owned subsidiary, Muliang HK and an indirectly wholly owned subsidiary Shanghai
Mufeng. Through its VIE Agreements, Mullan Agritech exercises control over Muliang Industry. Muliang Industry has two wholly-owned
subsidiaries (Zongbao and Muliang Sales), one 99% owned subsidiary (Fukang), one 60% owned subsidiary (Agritech Development),
and one indirectly wholly owned subsidiary Zongbao Cangzhou.

   NOTES
OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)   

The
consolidated financial statements were prepared assuming that the Company has controlled Muliang HK and its intermediary holding
companies, operating subsidiaries, and variable interest entities: Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang Industry, Zongbao, Zongbao Cangzhou,
Muliang Sales, Fukang, and Agritech Development, from the first period presented. The transactions detailed above have been accounted
for as reverse takeover transaction and a recapitalization of the Company; accordingly, the Company (the legal acquirer) is considered
the accounting acquiree and Muliang HK (the legal acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. No goodwill has been recorded.
As a result of this transaction, the Company is deemed to be a continuation of the business of Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, and
Muliang Industry.  

Share
Split   

On
June 30, 2015, a registration statement on Form S-1 was declared effective for the offer and sale of 30,525,000 shares (2,035,000
pre-split shares) to 39 new shareholders.  

Liquidity
and Going Concern   

The accompanying financial statements
have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles which contemplate continuation of the Company as
a going-concern basis. The going-concern basis assumes that assets are realized and liabilities are extinguished in the ordinary
course of business at amounts disclosed in the financial statements. The Company s ability to continue as a going concern
depends upon the liquidation of current assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company reported net
income of $387,273 and net loss of $2,661,262, respectively. The Company had working capital deficit of approximately $9.79 million
and $4.99 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. In addition, the Company had net cash inflows of $5,304,791
and net outflow $2,228,102 from its operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company
have improved its operating result, but the Company still incurred a loss from operation of $887,157 offset by other income of
$1,301,476 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which mainly included government subsidy income of $1,460,664. These
conditions still raise a substantial doubt as to whether the Company may continue as a going concern. 

In
an effort to improve its financial position, the Company is working to obtain new loans from banks and related parties, renew
its current loans, and to improve its operations upon its new fertilizer factories start to operate. In 2015, the Company obtained
capital contribution of approximately $16 million from its shareholders which successfully improved the Company s financial
position as of September 30, 2016. Additionally, one of the new fertilizer factories was completed and put in operations in August
2015 and another factory was also completed in June 2016.

   NOTES
OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP. The basis of accounting differs
from that used in the statutory accounts of the Company, which are prepared in accordance with the accounting principles of the
PRC ( PRC GAAP ). The differences between US GAAP and PRC GAAP have been adjusted in these consolidated financial
statements. The Company s functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi ( RMB ); however, the accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been translated and presented in United States Dollars ( USD ). All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated.  

Interim
Financial Statements   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)
applicable to interim financial information and the requirements of Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X of the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosure required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements. Interim results are not necessarily indicative
of results for a full year. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the
financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods have been included. These interim financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, as not all
disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements are presented. The interim financial
statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of computations as the audited financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Company to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of these financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Accordingly, actual results may differ from these estimates. Significant estimates include
the useful lives of property and equipment, land use rights, assumptions used in assessing collectability of receivables and impairment
for long-term assets.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

Mullan
Agritech consolidates the following entities, including wholly-owned subsidiaries, Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, and its wholly
controlled variable interest entities, Muliang Industry, and Zhongbao, 60% controlled Agritech Development, 99% controlled Fukang
and 65% controlled Zhonglian. The 40% equity interest holder of Agritech Development, 1% equity interest holders in Fukang and
35% equity interest holders in Zhonglian are accounted as non-controlling interest in the Company s consolidated financial
statements.  

The
variable interest entities consolidated for which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary. All significant inter-company
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Control
by Principal Stockholders   

The
Company s directors and executive officers and their affiliates or related parties own, beneficially and in the aggregate,
the majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Accordingly, if our directors and executive officers
and their affiliates or related parties vote their shares uniformly, they would have the ability to control the approval of most
corporate actions, including increasing our authorized capital stock and the dissolution or merger of our company or the sale
of our assets.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

For
purposes of the statements of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of three
months or less and money market accounts to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains cash with various financial institutions.  

Accounts
Receivable   

Accounts
receivable are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for
estimated losses. The Company reviews the accounts receivable on a periodic basis and makes general and specific allowances when
there is doubt as to the collectability of individual balances. In evaluating the collectability of individual receivable balances,
the Company considers many factors, including the age of the balance, a customer s historical payment history, its current
credit-worthiness and current economic trends. Accounts are written off after exhaustive efforts at collection.  

Inventories   

Inventories,
consisting of raw materials, work in process and finished goods related to the Company s products are stated at the lower
of cost or market utilizing the weighted average method.  

Advances
to Suppliers   

Advances to suppliers represent the cash
paid in advance for the purchase of raw material from suppliers. The advance payments are intended to ensure preferential pricing
and delivery. The Company recovered $12,649 of advances to suppliers that were written off for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

Property,
Plant and Equipment   

Plant
and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed as incurred; major replacements and improvements are capitalized. When assets
are retired or disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gains or losses
are included in income in the year of disposition. The Company examines the possibility of decreases in the value of fixed assets
when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

Included
in property and equipment is construction-in-progress which consisted of factory improvements and machinery pending installation
and includes the costs of construction, machinery and equipment, and any interest charges arising from borrowings used to finance
these assets during the period of construction or installation of the assets. No provision for depreciation is made on construction-in-progress
until such time as the relevant assets are completed and ready for their intended use.  

Estimated
useful lives of the Company s assets are as follows:  

The
apple orchard includes rental for an apple farm, labor cost, fertilizers, apple seeds, apple seedlings and others. The costs to
purchase and cultivate apple trees and the expenditures related to labor and materials to plant apple trees until they become
commercially productive are capitalized, which require a two-year period. The estimated production life for apple tree is 10 years,
and the costs are depreciated without a residual value. Expenses incurred maintaining apple trees during the growth cycle until
seedling apple trees or grafted varieties are fruited are capitalized into inventory and included in Work in process apple
orchard, a component of inventories.  

Depreciation
expenses pertaining to apple trees will be included in inventory costs for those apples to be sold and ultimately become a component
of cost of goods sold. Similar to other assets, the failure of our apple trees to be serviceable over the entirety of their anticipated
useful lives or to be sold at their anticipated residual value will negatively impact our operating results.  

Intangible
Assets   

Included
in the intangible assets are land use rights. According to the laws of the PRC, the government owns all the land in the PRC. Companies
or individuals are authorized to possess and use the land only through land use rights granted by the Chinese government. Intangible
assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their lease terms or estimated useful life.  

The
Company carries intangible assets at cost less accumulated amortization. In accordance with US GAAP, the Company examines the
possibility of decreases in the value of intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the fact that their
recorded value may not be recoverable. The Company computes amortization using the straight-line method over estimated useful
life of 50 years for the land use rights.

In
accordance with ASC Topic 360, the Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable, or at least annually. The Company recognizes an
impairment loss when the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset. The amount
of impairment is measured as the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its book value. The Company recorded
no impairment charge for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Advances
from Customers   

Advances
from customers consist of prepayments from customers for merchandise that had not yet been shipped. The Company will recognize
the deposits as revenue as customers take delivery of the goods and title to the assets is transferred to customers in accordance
with the Company s revenue recognition policy.  

Non-controlling
Interest   

Non-controlling
interests in the Company s subsidiaries are recorded in accordance with the provisions of ASC 810 and are reported as a
component of equity, separate from the parent s equity. Purchase or sale of equity interests that do not result in a change
of control are accounted for as equity transactions. Results of operations attributable to the non-controlling interest are included
in our consolidated results of operations and, upon loss of control, the interest sold, as well as interest retained, if any,
will be reported at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Pursuant
to the guidance of ASC Topic 605 and ASC Topic 360, the Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the purchase price is fixed or determinable and collectability is
reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of its fertilizer products and environmental protection equipment
upon shipment and transfer of title.  

The
Company currently leased part of the building of the Shanghai new plant to a third party as warehouse. The Company recognizes
building leasing revenue over the beneficial period described by the agreement, as the revenue is realized or realizable and earned.  

Cost
of Sales   

Cost
of goods sold consists primarily of raw materials, utility and supply costs consumed in the manufacturing process, manufacturing
labor, depreciation expense and direct overhead expenses necessary to manufacture finished goods as well as warehousing and distribution
costs such as inbound freight charges, shipping and handling costs, purchasing and receiving costs.

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes under the provisions of Section 740-10-30 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which
is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been recognized in its financial statements or tax returns.  

The
Company is subject to the Enterprise Income Tax law ( EIT ) of the People s Republic of China. The Company s
operations in producing and selling fertilizers are subject to the 25% enterprise income tax.  

Related
Parties   

Parties
are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company,
its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with
which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other
to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company
discloses all related party transactions.  

Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)   

Comprehensive
income (loss) comprised of net income (loss) and all changes to the statements of stockholders  equity, except those due
to investments by stockholders, changes in paid-in capital and distributions to stockholders. The Company s comprehensive
income (loss) consist of net income (loss) and unrealized gains from foreign currency translation adjustments.  

Foreign
Currency Translation   

The
Company s functional currency is the Chinese Renminbi ( RMB ); however, the accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been translated and presented in United States Dollars ( USD ). Results of operations and cash flows
are translated at average exchange rates during the period, assets and liabilities are translated at the unified exchange rate
at the end of the period, and equity is translated at historical exchange rates. As a result, amounts relating to assets and liabilities
reported on the statements of cash flows may not necessarily agree with the changes in the corresponding balances on the balance
sheets. Translation adjustments resulting from the process of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars
are included in determining comprehensive income/loss. The translation adjustment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was $57,235 gain and $61,380 loss, respectively. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the
functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing on the transaction dates. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies
are translated into the functional currency at the exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date with any transaction gains
and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
are included in the results of operations as incurred.

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)   

All
of the Company s revenue transactions are transacted in the functional currency. The Company does not enter into any material
transaction in foreign currencies. Transaction gains or losses have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on
the results of operations of the Company.  

Asset
and liability accounts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were translated at 6.6694 RMB to $1 USD and 6.4917 RMB to $1
USD, respectively, which were the exchange rates on the balance sheet dates. The average translation rates applied to the statements
of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 6.5792 RMB and 6.1128 RMB to $1 USD, respectively.  

Earnings
(Loss) per Share   

Basic
earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share
gives effect to all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock options or warrants,
using the treasury stock method (by using the average stock price for the period to determine the number of shares assumed to
be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants), and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted
method. Earnings per share excludes all potential dilutive shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. There were
no potential dilutive securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company adopted the guidance of ASC Topic 820 for fair value measurements which clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes
methods for measuring fair value, and establishes a fair value hierarchy to classify the inputs used in measuring fair value as
follows:  

Level
1-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities available at the measurement date.  

Level
2-Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar
assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived
from or corroborated by observable market data.  

Level
3-Inputs are unobservable inputs which reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions on what assumptions the market participants
would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best available information.  

The
carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, inventories, advances to suppliers,
prepaid expenses, short-term loans, accounts payable, accrued expenses, advances from customers, VAT and service taxes payable
and income taxes payable approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity of these instruments.

ASC
Topic 825-10   Financial Instruments   allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets
and liabilities at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and
is irrevocable, unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and
losses for that instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply
the fair value option to any outstanding instruments.  

The
following table summarizes the carrying values of the Company s financial instruments:  

Government
Contribution Plan   

Pursuant
to the laws applicable to PRC law, the Company is required to participate in a government-mandated multi-employer defined contribution
plan pursuant to which certain retirement, medical and other welfare benefits are provided to employees. Chinese labor regulations
require the Company to pay to the local labor bureau a monthly contribution at a stated contribution rate based on the monthly
basic compensation of qualified employees. The relevant local labor bureau is responsible for meeting all retirement benefit obligations;
the Company has no further commitments beyond its monthly contribution.  

Statutory
Reserve   

Pursuant
to the laws applicable to the PRC, the Company must make appropriations from after-tax profit to the non-distributable  statutory
surplus reserve fund . Subject to certain cumulative limits, the  statutory surplus reserve fund  requires annual
appropriations of 10% of after-tax profit until the aggregated appropriations reach 50% of the registered capital (as determined
under accounting principles generally accepted in the PRC ( PRC GAAP ) at each year-end). For foreign invested enterprises
and joint ventures in the PRC, annual appropriations should be made to the  reserve fund . For foreign invested enterprises,
the annual appropriation for the  reserve fund  cannot be less than 10% of after-tax profits until the aggregated
appropriations reach 50% of the registered capital (as determined under PRC GAAP at each year-end). If the Company has accumulated
loss from prior periods, the Company is able to use the current period net income after tax to offset against the accumulate loss.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncement   

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . Among other things, in the amendments in ASU
2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short term leases) at the commencement
date: A lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted
basis  and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified
asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made
to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business
entities upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales type, direct financing, and operating
leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of
the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any
transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply
a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on
its consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  . The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability
of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and
adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these
amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 20140-9,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606) . Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting  . The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions
are simplified, including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c)
classification on the statement of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
on its financial statements.

Accounting Pronouncement (Continued)   

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing  . The amendments add further guidance on identifying performance obligations and also to improve
the operability and understandability of the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle
of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective
date and transition requirements in Topic 606. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
on its financial statements.  

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients  . The amendments, among other things: (1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion
for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other
similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception;
(4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before
the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining
the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify
that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized
under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance
in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of
adoption. The effective date of these amendments is at the same date that Topic 606 is effective. The Company is currently in
the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  

In June 2016, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13)  Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments  which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets
held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which
will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods
within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
on its consolidated financial statements. 

 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,
which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the
statement of cash flows. The standard provides guidance in a number of situations including, among others, settlement of zero-coupon
bonds, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and
distributions received from equity method investees. The ASU also provides guidance for classifying cash receipts and payments
that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

The
Company believes that there were no other accounting standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact

The
Company s operations are carried out in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environment in the PRC, and by the general state of the PRC s
economy. The Company s operations in the PRC are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically

with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods
of taxation, among other things.  

Financial
instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and trade accounts
receivable. Substantially all of the Company s cash is maintained with state-owned banks within the PRC, and none of these
deposits are covered by insurance. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed
to any risks on its cash in bank accounts. A significant portion of the Company s sales are credit sales which are primarily
to customers whose ability to pay is dependent upon the industry economics prevailing in these areas; however, concentrations
of credit risk with respect to trade accounts receivables is limited due to generally short payment terms. The Company also performs
ongoing credit evaluations of its customers to help further reduce credit risk. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the

Item 2. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

The
information set forth in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  Operations ( MD A )
contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
including, among others (i) expected changes in our revenue and profitability, (ii) prospective business opportunities and (iii)
our strategy for financing our business. Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical information or statements
of current condition. Some forward-looking statements may be identified by use of terms such as  believes ,  anticipates ,
 intends  or  expects . These forward-looking statements relate to our plans, liquidity, ability to complete
financing and purchase capital expenditures, growth of our business including entering into future agreements with companies,
and plans to successfully develop and obtain approval to market our product. We have based these forward-looking statements largely
on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial
condition, results of operations, business strategy and financial needs.   

Although
we believe that our expectations with respect to the forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions within the
bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations, in light of the risks and uncertainties inherent in all future projections,
the inclusion of forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report should not be regarded as a representation by us
or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved.   

We
assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements to reflect actual results or changes in factors or assumptions
affecting forward-looking statements.   

Our revenues and results of operations could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result
of numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the risk of significant natural disaster, the inability of
our company to insure against certain risks, inflationary and deflationary conditions and cycles, currency exchange rates, and
changing government regulations domestically and internationally affecting our products and businesses.    

You
should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes attached hereto, and
the other financial data appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.   

US
Dollars are denoted herein by  USD ,  $  and  dollars .   

Overview    

During
the period from our formation on November 2014 to October 2015, we did not generate any significant revenue, and accumulated no
significant assets, as we explored various business opportunities.  

On
February 10, 2016, Muliang Industry Co., Ltd. ( Muliang Industry ) entered into an entrusted management agreement
with Muliang Agriculture Ltd. s wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai Mufeng Investment Consulting Co., Ltd. ( Shanghai
Mufeng ), which provides that Shanghai Mufeng will be entitled to the full guarantee for the performance of such entrusted
management agreement entered into by the Company. Muliang Agriculture Ltd. ( Muliang HK ) was incorporated in Hong
Kong, PRC on August 21, 2014. Other than the equity interest in Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang HK does not own any assets or conduct
any operations. Shanghai Mufeng is also entitled to receive the residual return of the Company. As a result of the agreement,
Shanghai Mufeng will absorb 100% of the expected gains or losses of the Company, which results in Shanghai Mufeng being the primary
beneficiary of the Company.  

Shanghai
Mufeng also entered into a pledge of equity agreement with the principal shareholders of the Company (the  Principal Shareholders ),
who pledged all their equity interest in the entity to Shanghai Mufeng. The pledge of equity agreement, which were entered into
by each Principal Shareholder, pledged each of the Principal Shareholders  equity interest in the Company as a guarantee
for the entrustment payment under the Entrusted Management Agreements. In addition, Shanghai Mufeng entered into an option agreement
to acquire the Principal Shareholders  equity interest in these entities if or when permitted by the PRC laws.  

Based
on these exclusive agreements, the Company will be treated as a variable interest entity ( VIE ) of Muliang HK as
required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( US GAAP ), because Muliang HK is the primary
beneficiary of the VIE. The profits and losses of the Company are allocated based upon the Entrusted Management Agreement.  

On
February 10, 2016, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with Muliang HK. Pursuant
to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the shareholders of Muliang HK transferred to Mullan Agritech all of the Muliang HK Shares
in exchange for the issuance of 150,525,000 shares of our common stock (the  Share Exchange ). As a result of the
Share Exchange, Muliang HK became a wholly-owned subsidiary of us and the shareholders of Muliang HK acquired approximately 100%
of our issued common shares.  

The
effect of the Share Exchange is such that effectively a reorganization of the entities has occurred for accounting purposes and
is deemed to be a reverse acquisition. Subsequent to the Share Exchange the financial statements presented are those of a combined
Muliang HK and its subsidiaries, including its VIE, Muliang Industry, as if the Share Exchange had been in effect retroactively
for all periods presented. As previously noted the  Company  for financial statement purposes was the consolidation
of Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang Industry and Muliang Industry s subsidiaries. Muliang Industry s subsidiaries
include its wholly-owned subsidiaries which are limited liability companies in People s Republic of China ( PRC ),
Shanghai Zongbao Environment Engineering Co., Ltd. ( Zongbao ) and Shanghai Muliang Agritech Development Co., Ltd.
( Agritech Development ); its 99% owned subsidiary, Weihai Fukang Bio-Fertilizer Co., Ltd. ( Fukang ),
a PRC limited liability company, and Shanghai Muliang Agricultural Sales Co., Ltd. (Muliang Sales), a PRC limited liability company
found in July 2015.  

Subsequent
to the Share Exchange the  Company  is referred to as the consolidation of Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang Industry,
Zongbao, Fukang, Agritech Development, Muliang sales, and Mullan Agritech, with Mullan Agritech as the legal acquirer in Share
Exchange, and subsequent to the Share Exchange the parent company of the consolidated entity. For financial reporting purposes,
Muliang HK was considered the acquirer in such transaction.  

We
are principally engaged in the meat and food processing and distribution business in the People s Republic of China ( PRC ).
Currently, we have one fertilizer processing plant located in Shanghai in the PRC. Our current maximum production capacity is
30,000 metric tons a year. We are currently building 2 new fertilizer plants in Weihai City, Shandong Province and in Shanghai
in the PRC. One of the new plants located in Weihai City was in operations in August 2015 with annual production capacity of 100,000
metric tons. Another new plant located in Shanghai has been completed in June 2016 with annual production capacity of 100,000
metric tons. This facility was designed with 4 production lines, with total contractual payment of approximately $11 million or
RMB 67.7 million. While this facility has not put in operations since its completion. Part of the plant was rent to Huayu Sandian
Automobile Air Conditioner Co. Ltd as warehouse from June 1 2016 to May 31, 2017, with a total rent of $235,705. We have an organic
fertilizer processing facility, located in Weihai City, Shandong Province, with the annual production capacity of 50,000 tons
organic fertilizers. The facility was designed with 2 production lines, with total contractual payment of approximately $4.6 million
or RMB 28 million, and had been completed on August 2015.  

Our
products are sold under the  Zongbao  brand name. Our customers are mainly located in provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang
and Shandong.  

On June 6, 2016, Muliang Industry
established a wholly-owned subsidiary, namely, Muliang (Ningling) Bio-chemical Fertilizer Co. Ltd ( Ningling Fertilizer )
in Henan Province, the central plain of China. Ningling Fertilizer is setup for a new production line of bio-chemical fertilizer
and has not begun any operation yet. 

 On July 7, 2016,  Muliang
Industry established a subsidiary, namely, Zhonglian Huinong (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd (Zhonglian) in Beijing City, China.
Muliang Industry owns 65% shares of Zhonglian, and a third-party company, Zhongrui Huilian (Beijing) Technology Co., Ltd owns
the other 35% shares. Zhonglian is to develop and operate an online agricultural product trading platform.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial
statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.
We evaluate, on an on-going basis, our estimates for reasonableness as changes occur in our business environment. We base our
estimates on experience, the use of independent third-party specialists, and various other assumptions that are believed to be
reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets
and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions.  

Critical
accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments, estimates and uncertainties, and potentially
result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. We believe the following are our critical accounting
policies:  

Basis
of Presentation    

Our
consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States,
or U.S. GAAP.  

Going
Concern    

As
reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had net accumulated deficit of $13,153,276 and $13,535,298
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Our cash balances as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $76,311
and $13,217, respectively. We had short-term payable of $12.37 million at September 30, 2016 which would due in the next 12 months.
In addition, we had a working capital deficit of $9,787,566 and $4,985,276 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.
These matters raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company
to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company s ability to further implement its business plan, raise additional
capital, and generate more revenues. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary
if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mullan Agritech, Muliang HK, Shanghai Mufeng, Muliang Industry, Zongbao,
Fukang, Agritech Development, Zongbao Cangzhou, Ningling Fertilizer, Muliang Sales and Zhonglian. All intercompany transactions
and account balances are eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates    

In
preparing financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements,
as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates, required by management,
include the recoverability of long-lived assets and the valuation of inventories. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

A ccounts
Receivable    

We
state accounts receivable at cost, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. Based on our past experience and current practice in
the PRC, management provides for an 100% allowance for doubtful accounts equivalent to those accounts that are not collected within
one year plus 50% for receivables outstanding for six months old. It is management s belief that the current bad debt allowance
adequately reflects an appropriate estimate based on management s judgment.  

Inventory
Valuation    

We
value our fertilizer inventories at the lower of cost, determined on a weighted average basis, and net realizable value (the estimated
market price). Substantially all inventory expenses, packaging and supplies are valued by the weighted average method.  

Apple
Orchard    

Apple
Orchard consists primarily of rental for an apple farm, labor cost, fertilizers, apple seeds, apple seedlings and others. The
costs to purchase and cultivate apple trees and the expenditures related to labor and materials to plant apple trees until they
become commercially productive are capitalized, which require a 2-year period. The estimated production life for apple tree is
10 years, and the costs are amortized without a residual value. Expenses incurred maintaining apple trees during the growth cycle
until seedling apple trees or grafted varieties are fruited are capitalized into inventory and included in Work in process apple
orchard, a component of inventories.  

Amortized
expenses pertaining to apple orchard are included in inventory costs for those apples to be sold and ultimately become a component
of cost of goods sold. Similar to other assets, the failure of our apple orchard to be serviceable over the entirety of their
anticipated useful lives or to be sold at their anticipated residual value will negatively impact our operating results.  

Revenue
Recognition    

Our
revenue recognition policies are in compliance with Securities Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Staff Accounting Bulletin
( SAB ) 104 (codified in Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification
( ASC ) Topic 605). Sales revenue is recognized after delivery is complete, customer acceptance of the product occurs
and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before satisfaction of all relevant criteria for revenue recognition
are recorded as unearned revenue. Unearned revenue consists of payments received from customers prior to customer acceptance of
our products.  

Sales
revenue represents the invoiced value of goods, net of value-added tax, or VAT. Our products sold and services provided in China
are subject to VAT of 13% of gross sales price. This VAT may be offset by VAT paid by us on raw materials and other materials
included in the cost of producing the finished product. We recorded VAT payable and VAT receivable net of payments in the financial
statements. The VAT tax return is filed offsetting the payables against the receivables.  

Income
Taxes    

We
account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes. 
We compute our provision for income taxes based on the statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the
PRC. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our annual tax position.  

New
Accounting Standards   

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 82510): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . The amendments in ASU 201601, among other things, requires equity investments
(except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be
measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income  Requires public business entities to use the
exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes  Requires separate presentation
of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and
receivables)   Eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions
used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The amendments
in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The new guidance permits early adoption of the own credit provision. In addition, the new guidance permits
early adoption of the provision that exempts private companies and not-for-profit organizations from having to disclose fair value
information about financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the
impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . Among other things, in the amendments in ASU
2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short term leases) at the commencement
date: A lease liability, which is a lessee's obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted
basis  and A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified
asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made
to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted for all public business entities and all nonpublic business
entities upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales type, direct financing, and operating
leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of
the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any
transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply
a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on
its consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  . The amendments in this ASU are intended to improve the operability and understandability
of the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations by amending certain existing illustrative examples and
adding additional illustrative examples to assist in the application of the guidance. The effective date and transition of these
amendments is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 20140-9,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606)  . Public entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2014-09 for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim reporting periods therein. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing  . The amendments add further guidance on identifying performance obligations and also to improve
the operability and understandability of the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle
of the guidance in Topic 606. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments are the same as the effective
date and transition requirements in Topic 606. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients  . The amendments, among other things: (1) clarify the objective of the collectability criterion
for applying paragraph 606-10-25-7; (2) permit an entity to exclude amounts collected from customers for all sales (and other
similar) taxes from the transaction price; (3) specify that the measurement date for noncash consideration is contract inception;
(4) provide a practical expedient that permits an entity to reflect the aggregate effect of all modifications that occur before
the beginning of the earliest period presented when identifying the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations, determining
the transaction price, and allocating the transaction price to the satisfied and unsatisfied performance obligations; (5) clarify
that a completed contract for purposes of transition is a contract for which all (or substantially all) of the revenue was recognized
under legacy GAAP before the date of initial application, and (6) clarify that an entity that retrospectively applies the guidance
in Topic 606 to each prior reporting period is not required to disclose the effect of the accounting change for the period of
adoption. The effective date of these amendments is at the same date that Topic 606 is effective. The Company is currently in
the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  

In June 2016, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 (ASU 2016-13)  Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit
Losses on Financial Instruments  which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets
held at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which
will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods
within those years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption
on its consolidated financial statements. 

 In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,
which is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and payments are presented and classified in the
statement of cash flows. The standard provides guidance in a number of situations including, among others, settlement of zero-coupon
bonds, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and
distributions received from equity method investees. The ASU also provides guidance for classifying cash receipts and payments
that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the
adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 

Results
of Operations   

We
focus on the implementation of our strategic plan to complete our new fertilizer production facilities. Those 2 new facilities
were designed with 50,000 metric tons and 100,000 metric tons of fertilizer production capacities. With completion of the 2 new
factories, we would be able to expand our market shares in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shandong Province, PRC. One of our 2 new fertilizer
factories located in Weihai City, Shandong Province was completed in May 2015 and put in operations in August 2015. However, due
to a lack of funding, we have put on hold of our another new factory construction which was located in Shanghai with a design
annual production capacity of 100,000 metric tons of fertilizer products and will continue to do so until additional funding is
secured. As of the date of this report, we had invested approximately $6.6 million or RMB 40 million in the Shanghai new factory
construction. To complete the Shanghai new factory construction, we may need additional $4.4 million or RMB 27.7 million to install
equipment.  

For
the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenue .
Total revenue decreased from $746,618 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $527,715 for the same period in 2016, which
represented a decrease of $218,903, or approximately 29%. Considering our old fertilizer plant located in Shanghai was not cost
effective and our new Weihai plant was in operations since August 2015 which was designed with modern equipment and better production
capacity, therefore, we put more marketing efforts in Shandong Province where our new Weihai plant locates to leverage our sale
forces. 

Cost of sales.  Cost
of sales decreased from $376,558 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $338,126 for the three months ended September
30, 2016, which represented a decrease of approximately $38,432, or 10%. 

Gross Profit (loss).   The
gross profit decreased from $370,060 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $189,589 for the three months ended September
30, 2016. The gross profit margin was decreased from 50% to 36% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Our
fertilizer products were facing strong competition from our competitors with lower selling prices. We reduced the prices for some
products to re-position our products in the market which was the main reason for the lower gross margin for the three months ended
September 30, 2016.  

Expenses .
We incurred $75,481 in selling expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $40,779 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. We incurred $298,341 in general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30,
2016, compared to $343,726 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased
by $10,683, or 3% for the three months ended September 30 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Our selling expenses increased
by $34,702 and our general and administrative expenses decreased by $45,385. The major increase in our selling expenses was from
our shipping cost.  

Interest
income (expense) . We incurred $139,350 in interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with
interest expense of $582,737 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Net Loss .
   Our net loss was $583,220 for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared with net loss of $1,083,665 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing a significant decrease
of $500,445 in net loss. The decrease in net loss were due to the decrease in interest expense, additional income from short-term
rental of factory, and gain from recovery of receivables written-off for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

For
the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Revenue . Total revenue
increased from $994,764 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,054,896 for the same period in 2016, which represented
an increase of $60,132, or approximately 6%. The increase in revenues was primarily due to the new plant in operation. Considering
our old fertilizer plant located in Shanghai was not cost effective and our new Weihai plant was in operations since August 2015
which was designed with modern equipment and better production capacity, therefore, we put more marketing efforts in Shandong Province
where our new Weihai plant locates to leverage our sale forces. 

  Cost of sales.  Cost
of sales increased from $619,080 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $725,813 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, which represented an increase of approximately $106,733, or 15%. The increase in cost of sales was in line with the decrease
in our revenue from fertilizer sales for the same period 

  Gross Profit.   The
gross profit decreased from $375,684 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $329,083 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. The gross profit margin was decreased from 38% to 31% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Our
fertilizer products were facing strong competition from our competitors with lower selling prices. We reduced the prices for some
products to re-position our products in the market which was the main reason for the lower gross margin for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.  

Expenses .
We incurred $187,807 in selling expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $140,249 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. We incurred $1,028,433 in general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared to $899,168 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased
by $176,823, or 17%, for the nine months ended September 30 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Our selling expenses
increased $47,558 and our general and administrative expenses increased $129,265. The major increase in our selling expenses was
from our shipping cost. The increase in our general and administrative expenses was mainly due to our additional inputs in hiring
more professional personnel to operate our new Weihai plant.  

Interest
income (expense) . We incurred $167,065 interest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and we incurred interest
expense of $1,657,362 in the same period of 2015.  

Income
Taxes . The effective tax rate in the PRC on income generated from the sale of prepared products is 25%. At September 30, 2016,
we had a net operating loss carry-forward for Chinese income tax purposes aggregating approximately $13,233,554 which will expire
through the year 2020.  

Net Income (Loss)  .
Our net income was $387,273 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with net loss of $2,661,262 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, representing a significant increase of $3,048,535 in net income. The breakthrough in net income were
due to gain on recovery of receivables written-off, rental income from short-term rental of factory, and government subsidy of
$1,460,664 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise
operate on an ongoing basis. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 our working capital deficit was $9,787,566 and $4,985,276,
respectively, mainly reflecting increases in our current assets, including $1,506,545 in due from related party, $31,351 in inventory,
which were partly offset by increases in our current liabilities, including $1,167,574 in due to related party  

We
have financed our operations over the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 primarily through cash from borrowings under
our lines of credit with various lenders and related parties in the PRC.  

The
components of cash flows are discussed below:  

Cash
Used in Operating Activities   

Net cash  provided
by operating activities was $5,304,791 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cash provided by operating activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of net income of $387,273 which was adjusted by depreciation and
amortization of $363,501, bad debt expense of $51,583, write-down or loss from inventory of $12,700. The Company had a decrease
of $145,122 in account receivable, an increase of $46,582 in our inventories, a decrease of $143,868 in prepaid expense, a decrease
of $161,999 in other receivable which were offset by an increase of $283,343 in other payable and an increase of $4,193,965
in account payable - related party.  

Net cash used in operating activities was $ 2,228,102
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted
primarily of net loss of $2,661,262 which was adjusted by depreciation and amortization of $172,110, loss from disposal of fixed
assets of $490,423. The Company had a decrease of $1,206,931 in advance to suppliers, an increase of $509,468 in Accounts payable
and accrued payables, a decrease of $266,493 in accounts receivable - related party, which were offset by an increase of $613,223
in account receivable, a decrease of $1,126,182 in accounts payable - related party, and an increase of $102,966 in inventory.    

Cash
Used in Investing Activities   

Net cash used in investing activities was
$ 6,320,292 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. The activities primarily consisted of our investments of $3,128,334 in the new fertilizer factory construction
projects in Shanghai City, purchase of plant and equipment of $1,527,199, and the advance to our related party of $1,527,199 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our Weihai factory was completed in May 2015 and put in operations in August 2015. The
construction project was completed and $10,507,535 was transferred to fixed asset.  

Net cash used in investing activities was
$ 6,702,163 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The investments included primarily our investment of $6,276,880 in two new fertilizer factory construction
projects in Weihai and Shanghai City.  

Cash
Provided by Financing Activities   

Net cash  provided
by financing activities was $1,079,820 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the period, cash used in financing
activities consisted of the capital borrowing of $1,064,621 from related parties, proceeds of $1,215,953 from short term borrowing,
offset by repayment of $1,200,754 in long term loan.   

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $8,812,127 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the period, cash provided
by financing activities included the proceeds of $8,063,306 from our short-term loans and $9,897,006 from our long-term loans,
which were partly offset by repayments of $18,732,370 in our short-term loans, repayment of $5,434,453 in long term loans.  

We
anticipate that our current cash reserves plus cash from our operating activities will not be sufficient to meet our ongoing obligations
and fund our operations for the next twelve months. As a result, we will need to seek additional funding in the near future. We
currently do not have a specific plan of how we will obtain such funding; however, we anticipate that additional funding will
be in the form of equity financing from the sale of shares of our common stock or renewing our current obligations with loaners.
We may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our directors or unrelated parties. Additional funding may not be available,
or at acceptable terms, to us at this time. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the
scope of our business development activities, which could harm our business plans, financial condition and operating results.  

Contractual
Commitments and Commitments for Capital Expenditure   

Contractual
Commitments   

The
following table summarizes our contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 and the effect those obligations are expected to
have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods.  

Commitments
for Capital Expenditure   

We
have completed building a new fertilizer factory in June 2016. The new plant, located in Shanghai, has annual production capacity
of 100,000 metric tons. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had invested approximately $0.28 million
and $4.73 million, respectively, in constructing this new fertilizer plants in Shanghai. This facility has not put in operations
since its completion. Part of the plant was rent to Huayu Sandian Automobile Air Conditioner Co. Ltd as warehouse from June 1
2016 to May 31, 2017, with a total rent of $235,705.  

Off
Balance Sheet Items   

Under
SEC regulations, we are required to disclose off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current
or future effect on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. An off-balance sheet arrangement means a
transaction, agreement or contractual arrangement to which any entity that is not consolidated with us is a party, under which
we have:  

any obligation under certain guarantee contracts,   
 
       any retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated
entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets,   
 
       any obligation under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative
instrument, except that it is both indexed to our stock and classified in shareholder equity in our statement of financial position,
and   
 
       any obligation arising out of a material variable interest held by us in an
unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to us, or engages in leasing, hedging
or research and development services with us.    

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that we are required to disclose pursuant to these regulations. In the ordinary
course of business, we enter into operating lease commitments, purchase commitments and other contractual obligations. These transactions
are recognized in our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   

Not
applicable because we are a smaller reporting company.   

Item
4. Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

Pursuant
to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation,
with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO )
and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ) (the Company s principal financial and accounting officer), of the effectiveness
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end
of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of September 30, 2016 to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure for the reason described below.  

Because
of our limited operations, we have limited number of employees which prohibits a segregation of duties. In addition, we lack a
formal audit committee with a financial expert. As we grow and expand our operations we will engage additional employees and experts
as needed. However, there can be no assurance that our operations will expand.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there has been no change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal controls over financial reporting. We will continue to monitor the deficiencies identified in internal controls and
make changes that our management deems necessary.
