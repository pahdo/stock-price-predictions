  (Unaudited)  

NOTE 1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

The accompanying unaudited financial statements of EnXnet, Inc.
( EnXnet  or  the Company ) for the six months ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information. Accordingly, the financial statements do not include
all information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States for complete annual financial
statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements reflect all adjustments,
consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation. The accompanying financial statements
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s March 31, 2016 Annual
Report on Form 10-K. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  

The Company has a working capital deficit and has incurred losses
since inception. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management of the Company has undertaken certain actions to address
these conditions.    Funds required to carry out management s plans are expected to be derived from future stock
sales and borrowings from outside parties. There can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in executing its plans.

ITEM 2.   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.  

STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. 

This Quarterly Report includes  forward-looking statements 
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Exchange Act which represent the expectations or beliefs concerning future events that
involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the demand for Company products and services and the costs associated
with such goods and services. All other statements other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report
including, without limitation, the statements under  Management s Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operations 
and elsewhere in the Quarterly Report, are forward-looking statements.  While the Company believes that the expectations
reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have
been correct. 

The following discussion of the results of operations and financial
conditions should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes appearing in this report. 

EnXnet, Inc. was formed under the laws of the State of Oklahoma
on March 30, 1999. On November 7, 2015, the Company incorporated EnXnet Energy Company LLC. in the State of Colorado as a wholly
owned subsidiary. EnXnet Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, EnXnet Energy Company, LLC. ( the Company ) is a natural
gas and petroleum exploitation, development and production company engaged in locating and developing hydrocarbon resources, primarily
in the Rocky Mountain region. The Company s principal business strategy is to enhance stockholder value by generating and
developing high-potential exploitation resources in these areas. The Company s principal business is the acquisition of
leasehold interests in petroleum and natural gas rights, either directly or indirectly, and the exploitation and development of
properties subject to these leases. The Company has leased property in Colorado and is currently searching for additional opportunities
in the natural gas and petroleum industry. Our initial goal has been to lease the mineral rights of acreage that has a high likelihood
of becoming a producing property. We will require additional funding to drill and complete a producing natural gas and petroleum
well. 

The Company currently can satisfy its current cash requirements
for approximately 90 days and has a plan to raise additional working capital by the sale of shares of the Company common stock
to select perspective individuals and from additional borrowings. This plan should provide the additional necessary funds required
to enable the Company to continue exploration and drilling program until the Company can generate enough cash flow from sales
to sustain its operations. 

The Company does not anticipate any significant cash requirements
for the purchase of any facilities. 

The Company has no full-time employee and two consultants. The
president and CEO of the Company is not receiving or accruing a salary at this time. 

Results of Operations:  

Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

The Company incurred operating expenses of $9,582 and $25,917 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $16,335 or 63%. The decrease in operating expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015 is attributed to
a decrease of $11,100 in consulting fees associated with our oil and gas operations and a decrease in professional services from
our auditors and SEC reporting service. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred
interest expenses of $10,477 and $8,548, respectively. 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred
net losses of $20,059 and $34,465, respectively. 

Table Of Contents        6        

Six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

The Company incurred operating expenses of $26,268 and $39,716
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $13,448 or 34%. The decrease in operating expenses
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 when compared to the six month period ended September 30, 2015 is attributed to a
decrease of $10,550 in consulting fees associated with our oil and gas operations. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred
interest expenses of $18,483 and $17,097, respectively. 

During the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 we incurred
net losses of $44,751 and $56,813, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources.  

From inception through September 30, 2016, the Company has issued
54,401,518 shares of its Common Stock to officers, directors and outside shareholders.  The Company has little operating
history and no material assets other than cash and restricted cash. The Company has $9,394 of unrestricted cash and $80,316 of
restricted cash as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company has incurred operating losses each year since its inception
and has had a working capital deficit at September 30, 2016. At September 30, 2016 and March 31, 2016 the working capital deficit
was $1,755,,830 and $1,740,325, respectively. The working capital deficit and cash balance raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern.  As a result of these factors, the Company s independent certified public accountants
have included an explanatory paragraph in their reports on the Company s March 31, 2016 financial statements which expressed
substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

Contractual Obligations.  

At the present time, the Company has no material commitments for
capital expenditures.  If capital expenditures are required after operations commence, the Company will pay for the
same through the sale of common stock, or through loans from third parties.  There is no assurance, however, that such
financing will be available and in the event such financing is not available, the Company may have to cease operations. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES.  

Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements. These statements have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. 

Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going
basis, we evaluate our estimates, based on historical experience, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. The following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions, judgments and estimates and were used in the preparation
of our consolidated financial statements: 

Cash and cash equivalents  

 Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with an original
maturity of six months or less. 

Use of estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the amounts reported in the financial statements. We regularly evaluate estimates and judgments based on historical experience
and other relevant facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

 Under FASB ASC 825 the Company is required to disclose the fair
value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate value. 

The Company s financial instruments consist of cash, accounts
receivable, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and debt.  The Company believes that the carrying amounts approximate
fair value for all such instruments. 

FASB ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measurement,
and expands disclosure about fair value measurements.  Topic No. 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date
(exit price).  Topic No. 820 classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy: 

Level 1:  
      Quoted prices for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets.   

Level 2:  
      Quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities
    in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and model-derived
    valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.   

Level 3:  
      Pricing inputs are unobservable for the assets
    and liabilities, including situations in which there is little to no market activity.   

Research and Development Costs  

 Research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. 

Stock Based Compensation  

 FASB ASC 718 requires that measurement of the cost of employee
services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments be based on the grant-date fair value of the award. Such costs
are recorded over the periods employees are required to render services in exchange for the awards. 

Income taxes  

 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated
future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets
and liabilities and their respective tax bases. These assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to
apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. 

We have net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future
taxable income. Future tax benefits for these net operating loss carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of
these benefits is considered more likely than not. To the extent that we will not realize a future tax benefit, a valuation allowance
is established. 

Basic and diluted net loss per share  

Basic loss per share is computed using the weighted average number
of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted loss per share includes the dilutive effects of common stock
equivalents on an  as if converted  basis. For the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, potential dilutive securities
had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company s results of operation, financial position or cash flows.

Unaudited Financial Statements  

The accompanying unaudited financial statements for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financia1
information.  In the opinion of management all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation, which consist
of normal recurring adjustments, have been included.  The accompanying financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s March 31, 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Table Of Contents        9        

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or
are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition,
revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 

CURRENT TRADING MARKET FOR THE COMPANY S SECURITIES. 

Currently the Company s stock is traded under the symbol
 EXNT  on the OTC Pink. There can be no assurance that an active or regular trading market for the common stock will
develop or that, if developed, will be sustained. Various factors, such as operating results, changes in laws, rules or regulations,
general market fluctuations, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and other factors may have a significant impact
on the market of the Company securities. The market price for the securities of public companies often experience wide fluctuations
that are not necessarily related to the operating performance of such public companies such as high interest rates or impact of
overseas markets.

ITEM 4. CONTROL AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. Our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded, based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this report,
that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13(a)-15(e) under the Securities Act of 1934, as amended) are
not effective to ensure that all information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the
Securities and Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in such
reports is accumulated and communicated to the management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer,
as appropriate and allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Controls.   In connection with the
above-referenced evaluation, no change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by
this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  

The Company is not involved in litigation at this time.  We
may from time to time be a party to various legal actions in the ordinary course of business.  There can be no assurance
that the Company will not be a party to litigation in the future that could have an adverse effect on the Company.
