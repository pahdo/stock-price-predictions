NOTE 1. ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF
BUSINESS  

Nature of
Operations  

EV
Energy Partners, L.P. together with its wholly owned subsidiaries ( we,   our  or  us ) is
a publicly held limited partnership. Our general partner is EV Energy GP, L.P. ( EV Energy GP ), a Delaware limited
partnership, and the general partner of our general partner is EV Management, LLC ( EV Management ), a Delaware limited
liability company. EV Management is a wholly owned subsidiary of EnerVest, Ltd. ( EnerVest ), a Texas limited partnership.
EnerVest and its affiliates also have a significant interest in us through their 71.25% ownership of EV Energy GP which, in turn,
owns a 2% general partner interest in us and all of our incentive distribution rights. 

Basis of Presentation  

Our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements included herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, certain information and disclosures normally included in annual financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed
or omitted in this Form 10-Q. We believe that the presentations and disclosures herein are adequate to make the information not
misleading. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods. The results of operations for the interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year. These interim financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10 K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

All intercompany accounts
and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. In these Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements,
all dollar and unit amounts in tabulations are in thousands of dollars and units, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. 

Subsequent Events  

We evaluated subsequent events for appropriate
accounting and disclosure through the date these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were issued. 

NOTE 2. EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION  

We grant various forms
of equity based awards to employees, consultants and directors of EV Management and its affiliates who perform services
for us. These equity based awards consist of phantom units and performance units. 

We estimated the fair
value of the phantom units using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Compensation cost is recognized for these phantom
units on a straight line basis over the service period and is net of estimated forfeitures. These phantom units are subject
to graded vesting over a four year period. We recognized compensation cost related to these phantom units of $1.9 million and $2.3
million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $4.9 million and $9.4 million in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These costs are included in  General and administrative expenses 
in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

As of September 30,
2016, there was $9.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested phantom units which is expected
to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.1 years. 

In September 2011,
we issued 0.3 million performance units to certain employees and executive officers of EV Management and its affiliates. These
performance units were fully vested as of January 2015, and we recognized compensation cost related to these performance units
of $0.2 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These costs are included in  General and administrative expenses 
in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

EV Energy Partners, L.P.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (continued)  

NOTE 3. ACQUISITIONS  

In October 2015, we
made the following acquisitions from certain institutional partnerships managed by EnerVest, a related party: 

we
                                         acquired Belden   Blake Corporation ( Belden ) for $111.1 million;   

we
                                         acquired oil and natural gas properties in the Austin Chalk for $25.9 million; and   

we
                                         acquired oil and natural gas properties in the Appalachian Basin and the San Juan Basin
                                         for $122.0 million.   

These acquisitions
were not accounted for as common control transactions as EnerVest does not control the institutional partnerships that sold the
oil and natural gas properties. 

As part of the acquisition
of oil and natural gas properties in the San Juan Basin, we assumed an obligation to deliver approximately 2.4 billion cubic feet
( Bcf ) of natural gas through December 31, 2016 under previously existing volumetric production payment ( VPP )
agreements. Under these agreements, certain of these oil and natural gas properties are subject to fixed term overriding
royalty interests which had been conveyed to the VPP purchaser. While we are obligated under these agreements to produce and deliver
to the purchaser its portion of future natural gas production from these oil and natural gas properties, we retain control of
these oil and natural gas properties and rights to future development drilling. If production from the oil and natural gas properties
subject to the VPP is inadequate to deliver the natural gas provided for in the VPP, we have an obligation to make up the shortfall
in accordance with the provisions of the agreements. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the remaining obligation under
these agreements was approximately 0.5 Bcf and 1.9 Bcf, respectively, of natural gas. 

At September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, we have recorded a liability of $1.0 million and $4.0 million, respectively, which is included in  Accounts
payable and accrued liabilities  in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets, for the cost to produce and deliver
to the VPP purchasers their portion of future natural gas production from these oil and natural gas properties. In the three months
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $0.02 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of accretion expense related
to this VPP obligation. 

We accounted for these
acquisitions as business combinations. The following table reflects pro forma revenues and net income for the three months and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 as if these acquisitions had taken place on January 1, 2015. These unaudited pro forma amounts
do not purport to be indicative of the results that would have actually been obtained during the periods presented or that may
be obtained in the future.

Financial Statements (continued)  

NOTE 4. RISK MANAGEMENT  

Our business activities
expose us to risks associated with changes in the market price of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. In addition, our floating
rate credit facility exposes us to risks associated with changes in interest rates. As such, future earnings are subject to fluctuation
due to changes in the market prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and interest rates. We use derivatives to reduce
our risk of volatility in the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and interest rates. Our policies do not permit
the use of derivatives for speculative purposes. 

We have elected not
to designate any of our derivatives as hedging instruments .  Accordingly, changes in the fair value of our derivatives are
recorded immediately to operations as  Gain (loss) on derivatives, net  in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements
of operations. 

As of September 30,
2016, we had entered into commodity contracts with the following terms: 

As of September 30, 2016, we had
entered into interest rate swaps with the following terms: 

EV Energy Partners, L.P.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (continued)  

The following table sets forth the fair
values and classification of our outstanding derivatives: 

We have entered into
master netting arrangements with our counterparties. The amounts above are presented on a net basis in our unaudited condensed
consolidated balance sheets when such amounts are with the same counterparty. In addition, we have recorded accounts payable and
receivable balances related to our settled derivatives that are subject to our master netting agreements. These amounts are not
included in the above table; however, under our master netting agreements, we have the right to offset these positions against
our forward exposure related to outstanding derivatives. 

Should our credit
facility become due and payable because of an event of default, our derivatives that are in a net liability position could also
become due and payable. We could also be required to post cash collateral related to these derivatives under certain circumstances.
As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we were not required to post any collateral nor did we hold any collateral associated
with our derivatives. 

NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability
of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices for similar assets and
liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly through
market corroboration. Level 3 refers to fair values determined based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities
at fair value. 

EV Energy Partners, L.P.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (continued)  

Recurring Basis  

The following table
presents the fair value hierarchy for our assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring
basis: 

Our derivatives
consist of over the counter contracts which are not traded on a public exchange. As the fair value of these derivatives
is based on inputs using market prices obtained from independent brokers or determined using quantitative models that use as their
basis readily observable market parameters that are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including third
party pricing services, brokers and market transactions, we have categorized these derivatives as Level 2. We value these derivatives
using the income approach with inputs such as the forward curve for commodity prices based on quoted market prices and prospective
volatility factors related to changes in the forward curves and yield curves based on money market rates and interest rate swap
data, such as forward LIBOR curves. Our estimates of fair value have been determined at discrete points in time based on relevant
market data. There were no changes in valuation techniques or related inputs in the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Nonrecurring Basis  

In
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, as a result of a reduction in 
 estimated   future net cash flows primarily caused by lower
oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, we recognized $15.2 million and $73.3 million, respectively, of impairment charges
to write down oil and natural gas properties to their fair value of $10.4 million and $31.4 million in the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

The
fair values were determined using the income approach and were based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows
from proved reserves. Significant Level 3 assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment
analysis included estimates of future prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of our estimated
reserves, appropriate risk adjusted discount rates and other relevant data.  

EV Energy Partners, L.P.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (continued)  

Financial Instruments  

The
estimated fair values of our financial instruments have been determined at discrete points in time based on relevant market information.
Our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities,
derivatives and long term debt. The carrying amounts of our financial instruments other than derivatives and long term
debt approximate fair value because of the short term nature of the items. Derivatives are recorded at fair value (see above). 

The
carrying value of debt outstanding under our credit facility approximates fair value because the credit facility s variable
interest rate resets frequently and approximates current market rates available to us. The estimated fair value of our senior
notes due 2019 was $232.6 million and $211.9 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which differs
from the carrying value of $341.8 million and $423.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The fair
value of the senior notes due 2019 was determined using Level 2 inputs. 

NOTE 6. ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  

We record an asset
retirement obligation ( ARO ) and capitalize the asset retirement cost in oil and natural gas properties in the period
in which the retirement obligation is incurred based upon the fair value of an obligation to perform site reclamation, dismantle
facilities or plug and abandon wells. After recording these amounts, the ARO is accreted to its future estimated value using an
assumed cost of funds and the additional capitalized costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production basis. The changes in the aggregate
ARO are as follows: 

As of both September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $2.9 million of our ARO is classified as current and is included in  Accounts payable and
accrued liabilities  in our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

NOTE 7. LONG TERM DEBT  

Long term debt,
net consisted of the following: 

EV Energy Partners, L.P.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (continued)  

Credit Facility  

As of September 30,
2016, we have a $1.0 billion credit facility that expires in February 2020. Borrowings under the facility are secured by a first
priority lien on substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties. The facility allows for up to $35.0 million in cash,
reduced by the amount of any quarterly distributions for the remainder of 2016, to be used for the redemption of our senior notes
due 2019 (see below) and limits cash held by us to the greater of 5% of the current borrowing base or $30.0 million. We also may
use up to $100.0 million of available borrowing capacity for letters of credit. As of September 30, 2016, we have a $0.3 million
letter of credit outstanding. The facility requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants, and, as of September 30, 2016,
we were in compliance with these financial covenants. 

The facility does
not require any repayments of amounts outstanding until it expires in February 2020. Borrowings under the facility bear interest
at a floating rate based on, at our election, a base rate or the London Inter Bank Offered Rate plus applicable premiums
based on the percent of the borrowing base that we have outstanding (weighted average effective interest rate of 3.54% and 3.86%
at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively). 

Borrowings under the
facility may not exceed a  borrowing base  determined by the lenders under the facility based on our oil and natural
gas reserves. As of September 30, 2016, the borrowing base under the facility was $450.0 million. The borrowing base is subject
to scheduled redeterminations as of April 1 and October 1 of each year with an additional redetermination once per calendar year
at our request or at the request of the lenders and with one calculation that may be made at our request during each calendar
year in connection with material acquisitions or divestitures of properties. 

In October 2016, the
borrowing base under the facility was reaffirmed at $450.0 million. 

8.0% Senior Notes due 2019  

Our senior notes due
April 2019 are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis, by all of our existing
subsidiaries other than EV Energy Finance Corp. ( Finance ), which is a co issuer of the Notes. Neither EV Energy
Partners, L.P. nor Finance has independent assets or operations apart from the assets and operations of our subsidiaries. 

In the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we redeemed $82.7 million of our senior notes due 2019 for $35.0 million, resulting in a gain on the early extinguishment
of debt of $47.7 million. 

NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

We are involved in
disputes or legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe the outcome of such disputes or legal
actions will have a material effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and no amounts have been accrued
at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

NOTE 9. OWNERS  EQUITY  

Units
Outstanding  

At September 30, 2016,
owners  equity consists of 49,055,214 common units, representing a 98% limited partnership interest in us, and a 2% general
partnership interest. 

Issuance
of Units  

In January
2016, we issued 0.2 million common units related to the vesting of equity based awards. 

Cash Distributions  

On January 25, 2016,
the board of directors of EV Management declared a $0.075 per unit distribution for the fourth quarter of 2015 on all outstanding
units. The distribution of $3.9 million was paid on February 12, 2016 to unitholders of record at the close of business on February
5, 2016. 

EV Energy Partners, L.P.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (continued)  

In April and May 2016, the board of directors
of EV Management announced that it had elected to suspend distributions for the first and second quarters of 2016, respectively.
The board of directors also elected to suspend distributions for the third quarter of 2016. 

NOTE 10. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS  

In 2015, we reclassified our unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements to reflect the operations of our midstream segment as discontinued operations due
to the sales of our interest in Cardinal Gas Services, LLC in October 2014 and our interest in Utica East Ohio Midstream LLC in
June 2015. 

Summarized financial information for our
midstream segment is as follows:

NOTE 11. EARNINGS PER LIMITED PARTNER UNIT  

The following sets forth the calculation
of earnings per limited partner unit: 

NOTE 12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

Pursuant
to an omnibus agreement, we paid EnerVest $4.0 million and $3.3 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and $12.0 million and $9.9 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in monthly
administrative fees for providing us general and administrative services. These fees are based on an allocation of charges between
EnerVest and us based on the estimated use of such services by each party, and we believe that the allocation method employed
by EnerVest is reasonable and reflective of the estimated level of costs we would have incurred on a standalone basis. These fees
are included in general and administrative expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations. 

EV Energy Partners, L.P.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (continued)  

We
have entered into operating agreements with EnerVest whereby a wholly owned subsidiary of EnerVest acts as contract operator of
the oil and natural gas wells and related gathering systems and production facilities in which we own an interest. We reimbursed
EnerVest approximately $5.3 million and $3.5 million in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
$16.0 million and $11.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for direct expenses incurred
in the operation of our wells and related gathering systems and production facilities and for the allocable share of the costs
of EnerVest employees who performed services on our properties. As the vast majority of such expenses are charged to us on an
actual basis (i.e., no mark up or subsidy is charged or received by EnerVest), we believe that the aforementioned services
were provided to us at fair and reasonable rates relative to the prevailing market and are representative of the costs that would
have been incurred on a standalone basis. These costs are included in lease operating expenses in our unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations. Additionally, in its role as contract operator, this EnerVest subsidiary also collects proceeds from
oil and natural gas sales and distributes them to us and other working interest owners. 

NOTE 13. OTHER SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION  

Supplemental cash flows and noncash transactions

NOTE 14. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

In August 2014, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014 15,
 Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern.  This ASU amends the accounting guidance for the presentation
and disclosure of uncertainties about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. It requires management to evaluate
and disclose whether there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management should consider relevant
conditions or events that are known or reasonably known on the date the financial statements are issued. The provisions of ASU
2014 15 are applicable to the annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2016 and for annual periods and interim
periods thereafter. We do not expect that adopting this ASU will have a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

EV Energy Partners, L.P.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements (continued)  

In February 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02:  Leases . The main objective of ASU 2016-02 is to increase transparency and comparability
among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about
leasing arrangements. The main difference between previous GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities
by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities arising
from leases on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 further defines a lease as a contract that conveys the right to control the use
of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified
asset means that the customer has both (1) the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the asset
and (2) the right to direct the use of the asset. ASU 2016-02 requires disclosures by lessees and lessors to meet the objective
of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. In
transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented
using a modified retrospective approach. For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years; early application is permitted.
We will continue to assess the impact this may have on its financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016 09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation . This ASU simplifies several aspects of the
accounting for employee share based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory
withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The provisions of ASU 2016 09 are applicable
to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption
is permitted for financial statements that have not yet been previously issued. We do not expect that adopting this ASU will have
a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016 15,  Statement of Cash Flows . This ASU addresses certain cash flow issues with the objective
of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how the cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the
statement of cash flows. The provisions of ASU 2016 15 are applicable to annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not yet
been previously issued. We do not expect that adopting this ASU will have a material impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements. 

No other new accounting
pronouncements issued or effective during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 have had or are expected to have a material
impact on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year
ended December 31, 2015.  

OVERVIEW  

We are a Delaware
limited partnership formed in April 2006 by EnerVest to acquire, produce and develop oil and natural gas properties. Our general
partner is EV Energy GP, a Delaware limited partnership, and the general partner of our general partner is EV Management, a Delaware
limited liability company. 

We operate in one
reportable segment engaged in the acquisition, development and production of oil and natural gas properties, and all of our operations
are located in the United States. 

As of December 31,
2015, our oil and natural gas properties were located in the Barnett Shale, the Appalachian Basin (which includes the Utica Shale),
the San Juan Basin, Michigan, Central Texas (which includes the Austin Chalk area), the Mid-Continent area in Oklahoma, Texas,
Arkansas, Kansas and Louisiana, the Monroe Field in Northern Louisiana, and the Permian Basin. As of December 31, 2015, we had
estimated net proved reserves of 22.0 MMBbls of oil, 747.0 Bcf of natural gas and 36.3 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, or 1,096.7
Bcfe, and a standardized measure of $536.4 million. 

Current Price Environment  

Oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids prices are determined by many factors that are outside of our control. Historically, these prices have been
volatile, and we expect them to remain volatile. In late 2014, prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids declined precipitously,
and such prices have remained low into the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Factors contributing
to lower oil prices include real or perceived geopolitical risks in oil producing regions of the world, particularly the Middle
East; lower forecasted levels of global economic growth combined with excess global supply; actions taken by the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries; and the strength of the U.S. dollar in international currency markets. Factors contributing
to lower natural gas prices include increased supplies of natural gas due to greater exploration and development activities; higher
levels of natural gas in storage; and competition from other energy sources. Prices for natural gas liquids generally correlate
to the price of oil and, accordingly, prices have fallen and are likely to continue to directionally follow the market for oil.
Further, excess supply with higher volumes in storage has resulted in a further drop in pricing for natural gas liquids. 

In the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, these low prices negatively affected our revenues, earnings and cash flows, and sustained low prices
for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. A further or extended decline
in prices could also adversely have a significant impact on the value and quantities of our reserves, assuming no other changes
in our development plans. 

As specified by the
SEC, the prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids used to calculate our reserves were the average prices during the
year determined using the price on the first day of each month. The prices utilized in calculating our total estimated proved
reserves at December 31, 2015 were $50.28 per Bbl of oil and $2.587 per MMBtu of natural gas. Had we used the current forward
strip prices at December 31, 2015 through December 31, 2021, we estimate that the present value (discounted at 10% per annum)
of estimated future net revenues of our proved reserves would have been approximately 29% higher and that our reserves on an Mcfe
basis would have been approximately 7% higher than our reserves calculated using SEC prices. 

Our Response to the Current Price Environment  

In response to continued
depressed prices and the fact that we have less production hedged in 2016 and 2017 at lower prices relative to previous years,
we took a number of steps to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. These steps include: 

reevaluating
                                         and suspending our common unit distribution to conserve excess cash;   

maintaining
                                         a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment;   

reducing
                                         the amount of capital spending we dedicate to the development of our reserves by approximately
                                         75%; 

focusing
                                         on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in operating
                                         and capital costs;   

continuing
                                         to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long life, producing oil and natural gas
                                         properties; and   

further
                                         realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of
                                         capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization
                                         of acreage.   

In April 2016, we
entered into an amendment to our credit facility that reduced our borrowing base, eased leverage covenants and added an interest
coverage ratio. Specifically, the amendment: 

allowed
                                         for up to $35.0 million of cash, reduced dollar for dollar by the amount of any quarterly
                                         distributions for the remainder of 2016, to be used for the redemption of our senior
                                         notes due 2019; and   

limited
                                         cash held by us to the greater of 5% of the current borrowing base or $30.0 million.   

In April 2016, the
board of directors announced that it had elected to suspend distributions to unitholders, and, since the adoption of this amendment
in April 2016, we have reduced leverage by repurchasing $82.7 million of outstanding senior notes due 2019 for $35.0 million.
This repurchase of our senior notes due 2019 at a discount to par created cancellation of debt income for our unitholders. 

In October 2016, the
borrowing base under the facility was reaffirmed at $450.0 million. As of November 7, 2016, we had $281.0 million outstanding under
our credit facility and $343.3 million of our senior notes due 2019 outstanding, for a total of $624.3 million, and we had $177.7
million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity and cash on hand. 

Business Environment  

Our
primary business objective is to provide stability and growth in cash distributions per unit over time. We have currently suspended
distributions to unitholders to conserve any excess cash to enable us to be able to pay a distribution at a future date. When
we resume our distribution payments, the amount of cash we could distribute to our unitholders will principally depend upon the
amount of cash generated from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things: 

the
                                         prices at which we will sell our oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production;   

our
                                         ability to hedge commodity prices;   

the
                                         amount of oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas we produce; and   

the
                                         level of our operating and administrative costs.   

In order to mitigate
the impact of lower prices on our cash flows, we are a party to derivatives, and we intend to enter into derivatives in the future
to reduce the impact of price volatility on our cash flows. We have entered into derivative contracts covering a portion of our
future production through December 2017; however, due to depressed commodity prices over the last 2 years and the unfavorable
terms of available hedging contracts, we have less production volumes hedged and the prices at which those volumes are hedged
are at lower average prices than in the past. This has left us with a greater exposure to current commodity prices and has impacted
cash flows from operations. Continued depressed commodity prices could continue to impact our acquisition and development plans,
our growth strategy and our ability to access additional capital in the capital markets and reduce the cash we have available
to pay distributions, which may delay our ability to reinstate our quarterly distribution. 

The primary factors
affecting our production levels are capital availability, including planned reductions in capital spending for 2016, our ability
to make accretive acquisitions, the success of our drilling program and our inventory of drilling prospects. In addition, as initial
reservoir pressures are depleted, production from our wells decreases. We attempt to overcome this natural decline through a combination
of drilling and acquisitions. Our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions
in excess of production. We will maintain our focus on the costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as
the costs necessary to produce such reserves. Our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources
and can be limited by many factors, including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals. Any delays
in drilling, completion or connection to gathering lines of our new wells will negatively impact our production, which may have
an adverse effect on our revenues and, as a result, cash available for future possible distributions. 

We focus our efforts
on increasing our reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long term operations.
Our future cash flows from operations are dependent upon our ability to manage our overall cost structure. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared with the
Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Net loss for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 was $19.2 million compared with $9.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The
significant factors in this change were (i) a $28.5 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset
by (ii) a $15.1 million decrease in impairment of oil and natural gas properties. 

Oil, natural gas and natural
gas liquids revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $50.8 million, an increase of $13.2 million compared
with the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was the result of an increase of $11.6 million from increased oil, natural
gas and natural gas liquids production and $1.8 million from higher natural gas and natural gas liquids prices, partially offset
by $0.2 million related to lower prices for oil.  

Lease
operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $3.1 million compared with the three months ended September
30, 2015 as the result of $5.4 million from increased production offset by $2.3 million from a lower unit cost per Mcfe. Lease
operating expenses were $1.42 per Mcfe in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $1.59 per Mcfe in the three months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Depreciation,
depletion and amortization ( DD A ) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $8.2 million compared
with the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of $6.7 million from increased production and $1.5 million from a higher
unit cost per Mcfe. The higher average DD A rate per Mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our reserves estimates. DD A
was $1.76 per Mcfe in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $1.66 per Mcfe in the three months ended September
30, 2015.  

General and administrative
( G A ) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $8.5 million compared with $8.6 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Included in G A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were
$0.5 million of lower due diligence costs related to the October 2015 acquisitions costs recorded during 2015 and $0.4 million
of lower equity compensation costs, partially offset by $0.7 million of higher fees paid to EnerVest under the omnibus agreement.
G A expenses were $0.47 per Mcfe in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $0.61 per Mcfe in the three months
ended September 30, 2015. 

In
the three months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred leasehold impairment charges of $0.7 million. In the three months ended
September 30, 2015, we incurred impairment charges of $15.8 million, of which $15.2 million related to oil and natural gas properties
that were written down to their fair value as determined based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Significant
assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis included estimates of future
prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of our estimated reserves, appropriate risk-adjusted
discount rates and other relevant data. The remainder of the impairment charges for the three months ended September 30, 2015
consisted of $0.6 million of leasehold impairments related to a change in our development plans for acreage in the Utica Shale. 

Gain on derivatives, net
was $8.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $37.0 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. This change was attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices and the impact of the expiration of derivative
contracts with more favorable terms as of December 31, 2015. The 12 month forward price at September 30, 2016 for oil averaged
$50.65 per Bbl compared with $49.42 at June 30, 2016, and the 12 month forward prices at September 30, 2016 for natural gas averaged
$3.07 per MmBtu compared with $3.02 at June 30, 2016. The 12 month forward price at September 30, 2015 for oil averaged $48.71
per Bbl compared with $61.99 at June 30, 2015, and the 12 month forward prices at September 30, 2015 for natural gas averaged
$2.82 per MmBtu compared with $3.13 at June 30, 2015. 

Interest expense for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $1.2 million compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to $3.1
million from a lower weighted average effective interest rate, partially offset by $1.9 million from a higher weighted average
long term debt balance. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared
with the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Net income (loss) for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $(77.2) million compared with $92.6 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The significant factors in this change were (i) a $255.5 million decrease in income from discontinued operations and (ii)
a $68.6 million unfavorable change in gain (loss) on derivatives, partially offset by (iii) a $47.7 million gain on early extinguishment
of debt and (iv) a $118.9 million decrease in impairment of oil and natural gas properties. 

Oil, natural gas and natural
gas liquids revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $130.9 million, an increase of $3.1 million compared
with the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was the result of an increase of $25.5 million for increased production, partially
offset by $22.4 million related to lower prices.  

Lease
operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $10.7 million compared with the nine months ended September
30, 2015 as the result of $15.0 million from increased production partially offset by $4.3 million from a lower unit cost per
Mcfe. Lease operating expenses were $1.47 per Mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $1.57 per Mcfe in
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

DD A
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $16.8 million compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as
a result of $17.0 million from increased production partially offset by $0.2 million from a lower unit cost per Mcfe. The lower
average DD A rate per Mcfe reflects the change that prices had on our reserves estimates and the decrease in the carrying
value of our oil and natural gas properties from the impact of the impairments that were recognized in 2015. DD A was $1.67
per Mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $1.68 per Mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

G A expenses for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $24.9 million, a decrease of $4.1 million compared with the nine months ended September
30, 2015. This decrease is primarily the result of (i) $4.8 million of lower equity compensation costs, of which $2.3 million
related to the accelerated vesting of the phantom units of a former officer in the nine months ended September 30, 2015; (ii)
a $1.3 million decrease in compensation costs, of which $0.8 million related to the vesting of our phantom units under our equity
compensation plan; partially offset by (iii) $2.1 million of higher fees paid to EnerVest under the omnibus agreement. G A
expenses were $0.46 per Mcfe in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $0.66 per Mcfe in the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

In
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred leasehold impairment charges of $3.4 million. In the nine months ended September
30, 2015, we incurred impairment charges of $122.2 million. Of this amount, $73.3 million related to oil and natural gas properties
that were written down to their fair value as determined based on the expected present value of the future net cash flows. Significant
assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted cash flows used in the impairment analysis included estimates of future
prices, production costs, development expenditures, anticipated production of our estimated reserves, appropriate risk   
 adjusted discount rates and other relevant data. The remainder of the impairment charges for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 consisted of $48.9 million of leasehold impairments, of which $48.4 million related to a change in our development plans
for acreage in the Utica Shale. 

Gain (loss) on derivatives,
net was $(17.2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $51.4 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. This change was attributable to changes in future oil and natural gas prices and the impact of the expiration of derivative
contracts with more favorable terms. The 12 month forward price at September 30, 2016 for oil averaged $50.65 per Bbl compared
with $40.45 at December 31, 2015, and the 12 month forward prices at September 30, 2016 for natural gas averaged $3.07 per MmBtu
compared with $2.49 at December 31, 2015. The 12 month forward price at September 30, 2015 for oil averaged $48.71 per Bbl compared
with $56.46 at December 31, 2014, and the 12 month forward prices at September 30, 2015 for natural gas averaged $2.82 per MmBtu
compared with $3.03 at December 31, 2014. 

Interest expense for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $5.7 million compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to $8.0
million from a lower weighted average long term debt balance, partially offset by $0.8 million from a higher weighted average
effective interest rate and the write off of $1.5 million of loan costs due to the reduction in the borrowing base and the
redemption of the senior notes due 2019. 

In the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we recognized a $47.7 million gain on the early extinguishment of debt as we redeemed $82.7 million of our
senior notes due 2019 for $35.0 million. 

In the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, income from discontinued operations was $255.5 million, which included the $246.7 million gain on the sale
of UEO. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Historically, our primary
sources of liquidity and capital have been issuances of equity and debt securities, borrowings under our credit facility and cash
flows from operations. Our primary uses of cash have been acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties and related assets, development
of our oil and natural gas properties, distributions to our unitholders and general partner and working capital needs. 

In response to continued
depressed prices and the fact that we have less production hedged in 2016 and 2017 at lower prices relative to previous years,
we took a number of steps to continue to preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. These steps include: 

reevaluating
                                         and suspending our common unit distribution to conserve excess cash;   

maintaining
                                         a sufficient liquidity position to manage through the current environment;   

reducing
                                         the amount of capital spending we dedicate to the development of our reserves by approximately
                                         75%;   

focusing
                                         on managing and enhancing our base business through continued reductions in operating
                                         and capital costs;   

continuing
                                         to evaluate strategic acquisitions of long life, producing oil and natural gas
                                         properties; and   

further
                                         realizing the value of our undeveloped acreage through either alternative sources of
                                         capital, including farmouts, production payments and joint ventures, or potential monetization
                                         of acreage.   

As of November 7, 2016,
we had $177.7 million of liquidity between our borrowing base capacity and cash on hand. We believe that this available capital,
coupled with net cash flows generated from operations and any proceeds from sales of assets will be adequate to fund our capital
budget for the remainder of the year and satisfy our short term liquidity needs. 

We may also utilize borrowings
under our credit facility and various financing sources available to us, including the issuance of equity or debt securities through
public offerings or private placements, to fund our acquisitions and long term liquidity needs. Our ability to complete
future offerings of equity or debt securities and the timing of these offerings will depend upon various factors including prevailing
market conditions and our financial condition. 

Long term Debt  

As of September 30, 2016,
we have a $1.0 billion credit facility that expires in February 2020. Borrowings under the facility may not exceed a  borrowing
base  determined by the lenders based on our oil and natural gas reserves. As of September 30, 2016, the borrowing base
was $450.0 million, and we had $272.0 million outstanding. In October 2016, the borrowing base under the facility was reaffirmed
at $450.0 million. 

As of September 30, 2016,
we had $343.3 million in aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due 2019. As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate
carrying amount of the senior notes due 2019 was $341.8 million. 

For additional information
about our long term debt, such as interest rates and covenants, please see Note 7 to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements    Long-Term Debt  contained herein. 

Cash and Short term Investments  

At September 30, 2016,
we had $6.0 million of cash on hand.  

Counterparty Exposure  

All of our derivative
contracts are with major financial institutions who are also lenders under our credit facility. Should one of these financial
counterparties not perform, we may not realize the benefit of some of our derivative contracts and we could incur a loss. As of
September 30, 2016, all of our counterparties had performed pursuant to their derivative contracts. 

Cash Flows  

Cash flows provided by
(used in) type of activity were as follows: 

Operating Activities  

Cash flows from operating
activities provided $26.5 million and $118.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The significant
factors in the change were $52.1 million of decreased cash settlements from our matured derivative contracts, an $11.7 million
federal tax payment related to the conversion of an acquired corporation to a single member LLC and a $30.1 million change in working
capital, primarily related to higher accounts receivable as a result of higher oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids production
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, partially offset by a $1.4 million income tax refund associated with one of our
partnerships. 

Investing Activities  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we spent $14.3 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties and received $2.4 million
from the sale of certain oil and natural gas wells and $2.8 million in cash settlements from acquired derivative contracts. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash flows used in investing activities from continuing operations totaled $49.3 million.
This consisted of $58.7 million for additions to our oil and natural gas properties and $25.9 million related to a deposit on
our October 2015 acquisition offset by $33.8 million from the release of cash deposited with a qualified intermediary to facilitate
like kind exchange transactions pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code and $1.4 million in proceeds from
the sale of oil and natural gas properties. Net cash flows provided by investing activities from discontinued operations of $572.2
million consisted of the proceeds from the sale of our interest in Utica East Ohio Midstream LLC ( UEO ). 

Financing Activities  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we received $48.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility, repaid $41.0 million of long term
debt borrowings, and paid distributions of $3.9 million to holders of our common units, phantom units and our general partner.
We also redeemed $82.7 million of our senior notes due 2019 for $35.0 million. 

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, we repaid $561.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility with proceeds from the sale of our
investment in UEO and the release of our restricted cash. We also received $30.0 million from borrowings under our credit facility,
incurred loan costs of $3.4 million related to the amendment of our credit facility and paid distributions of $75.7 million to
holders of our common units, phantom units and our general partner. 

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  

In the normal course of
business, we may enter into off-balance sheet arrangements that can give rise to off-balance sheet obligations. Other than the
off-balance sheet arrangements included in our 2015 Form 10-K, we have no other off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably
likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of or requirements for capital resources. 

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

our
                                         ability to effectively integrate companies and properties that we acquire.   

All of our forward looking
information is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expected.
Although it is not possible to identify all factors, these risks and uncertainties include the risk factors and the timing of
any of those risk factors identified in the  Risk Factors  section included in Item 1A of our   Annual Report
on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015 .  

Our revenues, operating
results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices
for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Declines in prices may materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity,
ability to obtain financing and operating results. Lower prices also may reduce the amount of oil, natural gas or natural gas
liquids that we can produce economically. A decline in prices could have a material adverse effect on the estimated value and
estimated quantities of our reserves, our ability to fund our operations and our financial condition, cash flows, results of operations
and access to capital. Historically, prices and markets have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely
to continue to be volatile. 

ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE
                                         AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

We are exposed to certain
market risks that are inherent in our financial statements that arise in the normal course of business. We may enter into derivative
instruments to manage or reduce market risk, but do not enter into derivative agreements for speculative purposes. 

We do not designate these
or plan to designate future derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value
of these instruments are recognized currently in earnings. 

Commodity Price Risk  

Our major market risk
exposure is to prices for oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. These prices have historically been volatile. As such, future
earnings are subject to change due to changes in these prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide
price for oil and regional spot prices for natural gas production. We have used, and expect to continue to use, commodity contracts
to reduce our risk of changes in the prices of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. Pursuant to our risk management policy,
we engage in these activities as a hedging mechanism against price volatility associated with pre existing or anticipated
sales of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. 

We have entered into commodity
contracts to hedge a portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production through December 2017. As of September 30, 2016,
we have commodity contracts covering approximately 69% of our production attributable to our estimated net proved reserves from
October 2016 through December 2017, as estimated in our reserve report prepared by third party engineers using prices, costs and
other assumptions required by SEC rules. Our actual production will vary from the amounts estimated in our reserve reports, perhaps
materially. 

The fair value of our
commodity contracts at September 30, 2016 was a net asset of $7.2 million. A 10% change in oil and natural gas prices with all
other factors held constant would result in a change in the fair value (generally correlated to our estimated future net cash
flows from such instruments) of our oil and natural gas commodity contracts of approximately $14.7 million. Please see  Item
1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)  contained herein for additional information. 

Interest Rate Risk   

Our floating rate credit
facility and interest rate swaps also expose us to risks associated with changes in interest rates and as such, future earnings
are subject to change due to changes in these interest rates. If interest rates on our facility increased by 1%, interest expense
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 would have increased by approximately $2.0 million. The fair value of our interest
rate swaps at September 30, 2016 was a liability of $2.1 million. A 1% change in interest rates with all other factors held constant
would result in a change in the fair value (generally correlated to our estimated future net cash flows from such interest rate
swaps) of our interest rate swaps of approximately $1.5 million. Please see  Item 1. Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements
(unaudited)  contained herein for additional information. 

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS
                                         AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

In accordance with Exchange
Act Rule 13a 15 and 15d 15, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016 to provide reasonable assurance
that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures include
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange
Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate,
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Change in Internal Controls Over Financial
Reporting  

There have not been any
changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the quarterly period ended September 30, 2016 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1.    LEGAL
                                         PROCEEDINGS  

We are involved in disputes
or legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe the outcome of such disputes or legal actions will
have a material adverse effect on our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 1A.    RISK
                                         FACTORS  

There have been no material
changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

reporting; and     

5.  The registrant s other certifying officer and I have

internal control over financial reporting.
