CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS   
 FOR THE 13 AND 39 WEEKS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2016  

1. General  

Accounting Policies  - Refer to the
Company s audited consolidated financial statements (including footnotes) for the transition period ended December 31, 2015,
contained in the Company s Transition Report on Form 10-K, for a description of the Company s accounting policies. 

Basis of Presentation  - The unaudited
consolidated financial statements for the 39 weeks ended September 29, 2016 and September 24, 2015 have been prepared by the Company.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the unaudited
interim financial information at September 29, 2016, and for all periods presented, have been made. The results of operations during
the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations for the entire year or other interim periods. However,
the unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial
statements included in the Company s Transition Report on Form 10-K for the transition period ended December 31, 2015. 

Depreciation and Amortization  -
Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment are provided using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated
useful lives of the assets or any related lease terms. Depreciation expense totaled $10,537,000 and $31,214,000 for the 13 and
39 weeks ended September 29, 2016, respectively, and $10,353,000 and $29,955,000 for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 24, 2015,
respectively. 

Long-Lived Assets -  The Company
periodically considers whether indicators of impairment of long-lived assets held for use are present. If such indicators are present,
the Company determines whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows attributable to such assets is less than
their carrying amounts. The Company recognizes any impairment losses based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over
their fair value. For the purposes of determining fair value, defined as the amount at which an asset or group of assets could
be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties, the Company utilizes currently available market valuations
of similar assets in its respective industries, often expressed as a given multiple of operating cash flow. The Company evaluated
the ongoing value of its property and equipment and other long-lived assets as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and
determined that there was no impact on the Company s results of operations. During the 39 weeks ended September 24, 2015,
the Company determined that indicators of impairment were evident at a specific hotel location and that the sum of the estimated
undiscounted future cash flows attributable to this asset was less than its carrying amount. As such, the Company evaluated the
ongoing value of this asset and determined that the fair value, measured using Level 3 pricing inputs (estimated cash flows including
estimated sales proceeds), was less than its carrying value and recorded a $2,600,000 impairment loss. Additionally, during the
39 weeks ended September 24, 2015, there was an impairment triggering event related to several assets at closed theatres. The Company
determined that the fair value of these theatres, measured using Level 3 pricing inputs (estimated sales proceeds based on comparable
sales), was less than their carrying values, and recorded pre-tax impairment losses of $319,000 during the 39 weeks ended September
24, 2015. 

8   

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  Accumulated other comprehensive loss presented in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consists of the following,
all presented net of tax: 

(1)  Amounts are included in
interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings. 

Earnings Per Share  - Net earnings
per share (EPS) of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock is computed using the two class method. Basic net earnings per share is
computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net earnings per share is
computed by dividing net earnings by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, adjusted for the effect of dilutive
stock options using the treasury method. Convertible Class B Common Stock is reflected on an if-converted basis. The computation
of the diluted net earnings per share of Common Stock assumes the conversion of Class B Common Stock, while the diluted net earnings
per share of Class B Common Stock does not assume the conversion of those shares. 

Holders of Common Stock are entitled to
cash dividends per share equal to 110% of all dividends declared and paid on each share of Class B Common Stock. As such, the undistributed
earnings for each period are allocated based on the proportionate share of entitled cash dividends. The computation of diluted
net earnings per share of Common Stock assumes the conversion of Class B Common Stock and, as such, the undistributed earnings
are equal to net earnings for that computation. 

9   

The following table illustrates the computation
of Common Stock and Class B Common Stock basic and diluted net earnings per share for net earnings and provides a reconciliation
of the number of weighted-average basic and diluted shares outstanding:

Equity    Activity impacting
total shareholders  equity attributable to The Marcus Corporation and noncontrolling interests for the 39 weeks ended September
29, 2016 and September 24, 2015 was as follows: 

Fair Value Measurements  - Certain
financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. Some are measured on a recurring
basis while others are measured on a non-recurring basis. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a recurring basis are those
that are adjusted to fair value each time a financial statement is prepared. Financial assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring
basis are those that are adjusted to fair value when a significant event occurs. A fair value measurement assumes that a transaction
to sell an asset or transfer a liability occurs in the principal market for the asset or liability or, in the absence of a principal
market, the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 

11   

The Company s assets and liabilities
measured at fair value are classified in one of the following categories: 

Level 1   - Assets
or liabilities for which fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date.
At September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s $70,000 of available for sale securities were valued using Level
1 pricing inputs and were included in other current assets. As of September 29, 2016, the Company s $1,659,000 of trading
securities were valued using Level 1 pricing inputs and were included in other current assets. 

Level 2   - Assets
or liabilities for which fair value is based on pricing inputs that were either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting
date. At September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the $88,000 liability (included in deferred compensation and other)
and the $16,000 asset (included in other long-term assets) related to the Company s interest rate swap contract was valued
using Level 2 pricing inputs. 

Level 3   - Assets
or liabilities for which fair value is based on valuation models with significant unobservable pricing inputs and which result
in the use of management estimates. At September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, none of the Company s fair value measurements
were valued using Level 3 pricing inputs. 

Defined Benefit Plan    The
components of the net periodic pension cost of the Company s unfunded nonqualified, defined-benefit plan are as follows: 

New Accounting Pronouncements - 
In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue From
Contracts With Customers , which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The guidance will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in
Generally Accepted Accounting Principles when it becomes effective. The new standard is effective for the Company in fiscal 2018.
The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company has not yet selected
a transition method and is evaluating the effect that the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures. 

12   

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring
that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance
sheet. The new standard is effective for the Company beginning in fiscal 2017 and may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively.
The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is evaluating the effect that the guidance will have on its consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which primarily affects the accounting
for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements of
financial instruments. The new standard is effective for the Company in fiscal 2018, with early adoption permitted for certain
provisions of the statement. Entities must apply the standard, with certain exceptions, using a cumulative-effect adjustment to
beginning retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is currently assessing the impact the
adoption of the standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , intended to improve financial reporting related to leasing transactions. ASU No. 2016-02 requires
a lessee to recognize on the balance sheet assets and liabilities for rights and obligations created by leased assets with lease
terms of more than 12 months. The new guidance will also require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users
better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from the leases. These disclosures include qualitative
and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The new
standard is effective for the Company in fiscal 2019 and early application is permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that
the guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which addresses
eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The new standard is effective
for the Company beginning in fiscal 2018, with early adoption permitted. The standard must be applied using a retrospective transition
method for each period presented. The Company is evaluating the effect that the guidance will have on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. 

The Company elected to early adopt ASU
No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Sock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ,
during the 13 weeks ended September 29, 2016, which required reflection of any adjustments as of January 1, 2016. The primary
impact of the adoption was the recognition of excess tax benefits as a reduction to the provision for income taxes for all periods
reported in fiscal 2016. Additional amendments to ASU No. 2016-09 which related to income taxes and minimum statutory withholding
tax requirements, had no impact to retained earnings, where the cumulative effect of these changes are required to be recorded.
Additionally, the Company also elected to continue estimating forfeitures when determining the amount of compensation costs to
be recognized each period. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits were applied on a prospective
basis, and therefore prior years have not been restated. The presentation requirement for cash flows related to employee taxes
paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of the periods presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The adoption
of ASU No. 2016-09 did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements or related disclosures.  

13   

On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted
ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (Subtopic 835-30) , which requires an entity to present
debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset, and requires
the amortization of the costs be reported as interest expense. The new guidance was applied on a retrospective basis to all prior
periods. Accordingly, $404,000 of debt issuance costs, previously included within other long-term assets, have been reclassified
as a reduction of long-term debt on the December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet, and $110,000 and $329,000, respectively,
of amortization of debt issuance costs, previously included in depreciation and amortization expense, have been reclassified to
interest expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 24, 2015. 

On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted
ASU No. 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , which changes the analysis that a
reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. ASU No. 2015-02 clarifies
how to determine whether equity holders as a group have power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the legal
entity s economic performance and could affect whether it is a variable interest entity (VIE). Two of the Company s
consolidated entities are considered VIEs. The Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIEs and the Company s interest
is considered a majority voting interest. As such, the adoption of the new standard did not have a material effect on the Company s
consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. 

2. Long-Term Debt  

On June 16, 2016, the Company replaced
its existing credit agreement, consisting of a $37,188,000 term loan and a $175,000,000 revolving credit facility, with a new five-year
$225,000,000 credit agreement that expires on June 16, 2021. There were borrowings of $89,000,000 outstanding on the new revolving
credit facility bearing interest at LIBOR plus a margin which adjusts based on the Company s borrowing levels, effectively
1.64%, at September 29, 2016. The revolving credit facility requires an annual facility fee of 0.15% to 0.25% of the total commitment,
depending on the Company s consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio, as defined in the credit agreement. 

The Company s loan agreements include,
among other covenants, maintenance of certain financial ratios, including a debt-to-capitalization ratio and a fixed charge coverage
ratio. The Company is in compliance with all financial debt covenants at September 29, 2016. 

The Company utilizes derivatives principally
to manage market risks and reduce its exposure resulting from fluctuations in interest rates. The Company formally documents all
relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk-management objectives and strategies for undertaking
various hedge transactions. 

14   

The Company entered into an interest rate
swap agreement on February 28, 2013 covering $25,000,000 of floating rate debt, which expires January 22, 2018, and requires the
Company to pay interest at a defined rate of 0.96% while receiving interest at a defined variable rate of one-month LIBOR (0.56%
at September 29, 2016). The notional amount of the swap is $25,000,000. The Company recognizes derivatives as either assets or
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value (i.e., gains or losses)
of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and on the
type of hedging relationship. Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting must be adjusted to fair value through earnings.
For derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods
during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The Company s interest rate swap agreement was considered effective
and qualified as a cash flow hedge from inception through June 16, 2016, at which time the derivative was undesignated and the
balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $159,000 ($96,000 net of tax) was reclassified into interest expense. As of
June 16, 2016, the swap was considered ineffective for accounting purposes and the change in fair value of the swap of $88,000
and $71,000 during the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2016, respectively, was recorded as a reduction to interest expense.
The Company does not expect the interest rate swap to have a material effect on earnings within the next 12 months. 

3. Capital Lease Obligation  

During fiscal 2012, the Company entered
into a master licensing agreement with CDF2 Holdings, LLC, a subsidiary of Cinedigm Digital Cinema Corp (CDF2), whereby CDF2 purchased
on the Company s behalf, and then deployed and licensed back to the Company, digital cinema projection systems (the  systems )
for use by the Company in its theatres. As of September 29, 2016, 642 of the Company s screens were utilizing the systems
under a 10-year master licensing agreement with CDF2. Included in furniture, fixtures and equipment is $45,510,000 related to the
digital systems as of September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015, which is being amortized over the remaining estimated useful life
of the assets. Accumulated amortization of the digital systems was $26,750,000 and $22,118,000 as of September 29, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively.  

Under the terms of the master licensing
agreement, the Company made an initial one-time payment to CDF2. The Company expects that the balance of CDF2 s costs to
deploy the systems will be covered primarily through the payment of virtual print fees (VPF s) from film distributors to
CDF2 each time a digital movie is booked on one of the systems deployed on a Company screen. The Company agreed to make an average
number of bookings of eligible digital movies on each screen on which a licensed system has been deployed to provide for a minimum
level of VPF s paid by distributors (standard booking commitment) to CDF2. To the extent the VPF s paid by distributors
are less than the standard booking commitment, the Company must make a shortfall payment to CDF2. Based upon the Company s
historical booking patterns, the Company does not expect to make any shortfall payments during the life of the agreement. Accounting
Standards Codification No. 840,  Leases , requires that the Company consider the entire amount of the standard booking commitment
minimum lease payments for purposes of determining the capital lease obligation. The maximum amount per year that the Company could
be required to pay is approximately $6,163,000 until the obligation is fully satisfied. 

15   

The Company s capital lease obligation
is being reduced as VPF s are paid by the film distributors to CDF2. The Company has recorded the reduction of the obligation
associated with the payment of VPF s as a reduction of the interest related to the obligation and the amortization incurred
related to the systems, as the payments represent a specific reimbursement of the cost of the systems by the studios. Based on
the Company s expected minimum number of eligible movies to be booked, the Company expects the obligation to be reduced by
at least $5,452,000 within the next 12 months. This reduction will be recognized as an offset to amortization and is expected to
offset the majority of the amortization of the systems. 

4. Income Taxes  

The Company s effective income tax
rate, adjusted for losses from noncontrolling interests, for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2016 was 37.7% and 38.5%,
respectively, and was 38.5% for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 24, 2015. The Company does not include the income tax expense
or benefit related to the net earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in its income tax expense as the entities
are considered pass-through entities and, as such, the income tax expense or benefit is attributable to its owners. 

5. Related Party Transaction  

During the 13 weeks ended September 29,
2016, the Company received $4,093,000 from certain Marcus family trusts, representing the reimbursement of premiums paid on split
dollar life insurance policies pursuant to existing agreements with the trusts. The remaining $10,131,000 of premiums paid under
a separate split dollar life insurance policy pursuant to an agreement with a family trust is included in other (long-term) assets
of September 29, 2016. 

6. Business Segment Information  

The Company s primary operations
are reported in the following business segments: Theatres and Hotels/Resorts. Corporate items include amounts not allocable to
the business segments. Corporate revenues consist principally of rent and the corporate operating loss includes general corporate
expenses. Corporate information technology costs and accounting shared services costs are allocated to the business segments based
upon several factors, including actual usage and segment revenues. 

16   

Following is a summary of business segment
information for the 13 and 39 weeks ended September 29, 2016 and September 24, 2015 (in thousands):

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements  

Certain matters
discussed in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in
this Form 10-Q are  forward-looking  statements   intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established
by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements may generally be identified as such because
the context of such statements include words such as we  believe,   anticipate,   expect  or
words of similar import. Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements.
Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which may cause results to differ materially from
those expected, including, but not limited to, the following: (1) the availability, in terms of both quantity and audience appeal,
of motion pictures for our theatre division, as well as other industry dynamics such as the maintenance of a suitable window between
the date such motion pictures are released in theatres and the date they are released to other distribution channels; (2) the effects
of adverse economic conditions in our markets, particularly with respect to our hotels and resorts division; (3) the effects on
our occupancy and room rates of the relative industry supply of available rooms at comparable lodging facilities in our markets;
(4) the effects of competitive conditions in our markets; (5) our ability to achieve expected benefits and performance from our
strategic initiatives and acquisitions; (6) the effects of increasing depreciation expenses, reduced operating profits during major
property renovations, impairment losses, and preopening and start-up costs due to the capital intensive nature of our businesses;
(7) the effects of adverse weather conditions, particularly during the winter in the Midwest and in our other markets; (8) our
ability to identify properties to acquire, develop and/or manage and the continuing availability of funds for such development;
and (9) the adverse impact on business and consumer spending on travel, leisure and entertainment resulting from terrorist attacks
in the United States or other incidents of violence in public venues, such as hotels and movie theatres. Shareholders, potential
investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors carefully in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

General  

As a result of a recent
change in our fiscal year, we now report our consolidated and individual segment results of operations on a 52- or 53-week fiscal
year ending on the last Thursday in December. Fiscal 2016 is a 52-week year beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending on December
29, 2016. In this Form 10-Q and during the remainder of fiscal 2016, we will compare financial results to comparable periods from
a prior year that we refer to as  fiscal 2015C.  Fiscal 2015C consists of the 53-week period beginning December 26,
2014 and ended on December 31, 2015. 

18   

We divide our fiscal
year into three 13-week quarters and a final quarter consisting of 13 or 14 weeks. The third quarter of fiscal 2016 consisted of
the 13-week period beginning July 1, 2016 and ended on September 29, 2016. The third quarter of fiscal 2015C consisted of the 13-week
period beginning on June 26, 2015 and ended on September 24, 2015. The first three quarters of fiscal 2016 consisted of the 39-week
period beginning January 1, 2016 and ended on September 29, 2016. The first three quarters of fiscal 2015C consisted of the 39-week
period beginning on December 26, 2014 and ended on September 24, 2015. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 will consist of the 13-week
period beginning September 30, 2016 and ending on December 29, 2016. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2015C benefited from an additional
week of operations and consisted of the 14-week period beginning on September 25, 2015 and ended on December 31, 2015. Our primary
operations are reported in the following two business segments: movie theatres and hotels and resorts. 

The following
table sets forth revenues, operating income, other income (expense), net earnings and net earnings per common share for the
third quarter and first three  quarters of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015C (in millions, except for per share and variance
percentage data): 

Revenues increased
during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal
2015C due to increased revenues from our theatre division, partially offset by a slight decrease in revenues from our hotels and
resorts division. Operating income (earnings before other income/expense and income taxes) and net earnings attributable to The
Marcus Corporation increased during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015C due to improved
operating results from our theatre division, partially offset by a slight decrease in operating income from our hotels and resorts
division. Operating income and net earnings attributable to The Marcus Corporation increased during the first three quarters of
fiscal 2016 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C due to improved operating results from both our theatre and hotels
and resorts divisions. 

19   

Operating results from
our theatre division during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 were favorably impacted by a stronger slate
of movies, increased attendance and average ticket price resulting from positive customer response to our recent investments and
pricing strategies, and increased concession revenues per person compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal
2015C. Comparisons of operating results from our hotels and resorts division during the third quarter and first three quarters
of fiscal 2016 to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C were unfavorably impacted by the fact that last year s
results included a hotel that has since been sold. Operating results from our hotels and resorts division during the third quarter
of fiscal 2016 were also negatively impacted by reduced food and beverage revenues compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015C,
partially offset by increased revenue per available room for comparable hotels. Operating results from our hotels and resorts division
during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 were favorably impacted by strong cost controls and increased revenue per available
room for comparable hotels during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C.
Comparisons to operating income for our hotels and resorts division during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 were also favorably
impacted by the fact that operating income during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C included a $2.6 million impairment charge
related to one specific hotel. 

Operating losses from
our corporate items, which include amounts not allocable to the business segments, increased during the third quarter and first
three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C due in part to increased incentive
compensation expense as a result of our strong operating performance during the fiscal 2016 periods. Operating losses from our
corporate items also increased during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C
primarily due to the fact that the prior year period was favorably impacted by the reimbursement of approximately $1.4 million
of costs previously expensed related to a mixed-use retail development known as The Corners of Brookfield. 

We did not have any
significant variations in investment income or gains/losses on disposition of property, equipment and other assets during the third
quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. The timing
of periodic sales and disposals of our property and equipment, including the disposal of old theatre seats and other items in conjunction
with our theatre renovations, may vary from quarter to quarter, resulting in variations in our reported gains or losses on disposition
of property and equipment. 

Our interest expense
totaled $2.1 million and $7.0 million for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively, compared to
$2.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively, for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C, a decrease of approximately
$400,000 during each respective period. The decrease in interest expense during the fiscal 2016 periods was due primarily to a
lower average interest rate, as certain principal payments we made on our fixed rate senior notes during the second quarter of
fiscal 2016 were funded by borrowings on our revolving credit facility, which has a lower associated interest rate. A small decrease
in our total borrowings during the fiscal 2016 periods compared to the comparable fiscal 2015C periods also contributed to the
decrease in interest expense during the fiscal 2016 periods. Changes in our borrowing levels due to variations in our operating
results, capital expenditures, share repurchases and asset sale proceeds, among other items, may impact our actual reported interest
expense in future periods, as would changes in the mix between long-term fixed rate debt and short-term variable rate debt in our
debt portfolio. 

20   

Net equity earnings
(losses) from unconsolidated joint ventures totaled $161,000 and $270,000 for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal
2016, respectively, compared to $2,000 and $(121,000), respectively, during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C.
Improved operating results from our two hotel joint ventures during the fiscal 2016 periods contributed to the increases in net
equity earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures. 

We reported income
tax expense for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 of $8.7 million and $18.2 million, respectively, compared
to $6.8 million and $14.5 million, respectively, during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. The increase
in income tax expense was the result of increased earnings during the fiscal 2016 periods. Our effective income tax rate, after
adjusting for losses from noncontrolling interests that are not tax-effected because the entities involved are tax pass-through
entities, was 38.5% during the first three quarters of both fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015C. As of the date of this report, we anticipate
that our effective income tax rate for the remaining quarter of fiscal 2016 will remain close to our historical 38-40% average,
excluding any changes in our liability for unrecognized tax benefits or potential changes in federal and state income tax rates.
Our actual fiscal 2016 effective income tax rate may be different from our estimated quarterly rates depending upon actual facts
and circumstances. 

The operating results
of two majority-owned hotels, The Skirvin Hilton and The Lincoln Marriott Cornhusker Hotel, are included in the hotels and resorts
division revenue and operating income, and the after-tax net earnings or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in these
hotels is deducted from or added to net earnings on the consolidated statements of earnings. We reported net losses attributable
to noncontrolling interests of $120,000 and $282,000 during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively,
compared to net losses of $159,000 and $453,000, respectively, during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. 

Theatres  

The following table
sets forth revenues, operating income and operating margin for our theatre division for the third quarter and first three quarters
of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015C (in millions, except for variance percentage and operating margin): 

21   

Our theatre division
revenues, operating income and operating margin increased during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 due
primarily to increases in our attendance, average ticket price and average concession revenues per person compared to the third
quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C, resulting in increased box office receipts and concession revenues. Our theatre
division also has an active cost savings initiative (CSI) in place pursuant to which the division has targeted cost savings in
excess of $2 million during fiscal 2016. Significant progress towards achievement of this CSI target, which includes improvements
in theatre labor efficiencies, as well as various other operational and administrative cost items, further improved our already
strong operating margins during the fiscal 2016 periods. We expect to meet our CSI targeted costs savings during fiscal 2016. 

The following table
provides a further breakdown of the components of revenues for the theatre division for the third quarter and first three quarters
of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015C (in millions, except for variance percentage): 

According to data received
from Rentrak (a national box office reporting service for the theatre industry) and compiled by us to evaluate our fiscal 2016
third quarter and first three quarters results, United States box office receipts increased 9.3% and 1.9%, respectively, during
our fiscal 2016 third quarter and first three quarters when compared to the same weeks included in our fiscal 2015C, indicating
that our box office receipts in the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 outperformed the industry by 10.5 and
6.2 percentage points, respectively. If we compare our fiscal 2016 third quarter box office receipts to the weeks in fiscal 2015C
that more closely align to this fiscal year on the calendar (the 13 weeks beginning July 3, 2015 and ended on October 1, 2015),
our box office receipts increased 25.2% over the prior year compared to 14.7% for United States box office receipts, a favorable
difference of 10.5 percentage points. If we compare our fiscal 2016 first three quarters box office receipts to the weeks in fiscal
2015C that more closely align to this fiscal year on the calendar (the 39 weeks beginning January 2, 2015 and ended on October
1, 2015), our box office receipts increased 11.5% over the prior year compared to 4.6% for United States box office receipts, a
favorable difference of 6.9 percentage points. 

We have now outperformed
the industry average during 11 of the last 12 quarters that we have reported (including during the five-week final period of our
transition period ended December 31, 2015). We believe our continued outperformance compared to the industry average is attributable
to the investments we have made in new features and amenities in select theatres and our implementation of innovative operating
and marketing strategies, including our $5 Tuesday promotion and our customer loyalty program. 

22   

Our average ticket
price increased 4.2% and 4.6%, respectively, during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third
quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. The increase was partially attributable to modest price increases we implemented
in January 2016. In addition, the fact that we have increased our number of premium large format (PLF) screens, with a corresponding
price premium, also contributed to our increased average ticket price during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal
2016. The percentage of our total box office receipts attributable to 3D presentations also increased slightly during the first
three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C, due primarily to a small increase in the quantity
and quality of 3D films released in fiscal 2016 to date, contributing to our higher average ticket price. Conversely, we believe
that a change in film product mix had a negative impact on our average ticket price during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016,
as two of our top three films for the first three quarters were animated or family-oriented movies (resulting in a higher percentage
of lower-priced children s tickets sold, compared to more adult-oriented and PG-13 and R-rated films that typically result
in a higher average ticket price), compared to no films in that genre among our top three films during the first three quarters
of fiscal 2015C. The increase in average ticket price contributed approximately $1.7 million and $5.5 million, respectively, to
box office receipts during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, accounting for approximately 22% and 53%,
respectively, of the increase in our box office receipts during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared
to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. 

Our concession revenues
increased during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters
of fiscal 2015C due to increased attendance at comparable theatres and an increase in our average concession revenues per person.
Our average concession revenues per person increased 1.4% and 3.8%, respectively, during the third quarter and first three quarters
of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. The increase in our average concession revenues
per person contributed approximately $400,000 and $3.0 million, respectively, to concession revenues during the third quarter and
first three quarters of fiscal 2016, accounting for approximately 9% and 51%, respectively, of the increase in our concession revenues
during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal
2015C. 

A change in concession
product mix, including increased sales of non-traditional food and beverage items from our increased number of  Take Five   S M    
Lounge ,  Zaffiro s  Express  and  Reel Sizzle   outlets, was the primary reason for our increased average
concession sales per person during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and
first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. Conversely, we believe that the previously described change in film product mix during the
first three quarters of fiscal 2016 slowed the growth of our average concession sales per person, as animated and family-oriented
films tend not to contribute to sales of non-traditional food and beverage items as much as adult-oriented films. 

23   

Other revenues
increased during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three
quarters of fiscal 2015C, due primarily to an increase in internet surcharge ticketing fees and an increase in pre-show
advertising income. Our agreement with our current advertising provider, Screenvision, includes a provision for a one-time
incentive payment if a defined cumulative attendance milestone is reached within a defined time period. Based upon our
attendance projections as of the date of this report, we expect to reach this attendance milestone and receive this one-time
payment during our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter. In such case, our operating results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016
would be positively impacted by this approximately $3.3 million one-time payment. 

Comparable theatre
attendance increased 14.7% and 3.0%, respectively, during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to
the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C, due primarily to a stronger film slate in the current year periods.
We believe that a combination of several other factors also contributed to this increase in attendance and our above-described
industry outperformance. In addition to the $5 Tuesday promotion that continued to perform well, we believe our fiscal 2016 third
quarter and first three quarters attendance was favorably impacted by increased attendance at theatres that have added our spacious
new DreamLounger  S M    electric all-recliner seating, our proprietary  Ultra Screen
DLX  and  Super Screen DLX  S M    PLF screens and our unique food and
beverage outlets described above. We also believe that we benefitted from our customer loyalty program, which now has over 1.6
million members. 

Box office receipts
increased during 10 of the 13 weeks of the third quarter of fiscal 2016, with the greatest increase in attendance occurring during
July and the first half of August. Although attendance did increase during September 2016 compared to September 2015, historically,
the second half of August and the month of September have comprised one of the weakest periods for movie-going, as students return
to school and the quality of films released tends to weaken. In addition, the Olympics likely had some negative impact on movie-going
during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, as television viewing tends to increase during the two weeks of events. For the first
three quarters of fiscal 2016, the increase in attendance occurred despite the fact that the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C
included the week between Christmas and New Year s Eve, traditionally one of the busiest weeks of the year. 

Our highest grossing
films during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 included  The Secret Life of Pets ,  Suicide Squad ,  Finding Dory , 
Jason Bourne  and  Star Trek Beyond . The film slate during the third quarters of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015C were weighted
equally towards strong blockbuster movies, as evidenced by the fact that our top five films during our fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015C
third quarters each accounted for 42% of our total box office results, both expressed as a percentage of our total box office receipts
for the period. Our film rental costs, expressed as a percentage of our total box office receipts for the applicable period, decreased
slightly during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015C and were unchanged during the first
three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. 

24   

Film product
for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 has, through the date of this report, produced box office results  slightly higher than
the same period of fiscal 2015C, and we believe we have continued to outperform the industry during this period.        Top
performing films during this period have included  The Girl on the Train ,  The Accountant ,  Madea
Halloween ,  Inferno ,  Doctor Strange  and  Trolls . Films scheduled to be released during
the traditionally busy Thanksgiving to Christmas period include the Harry Potter prequel  Fantastic Beasts and Where to
Find Them , Disney s next animated film  Moana ,  Collateral Beauty ,  La La Land , the highly
anticipated  Rogue One: A Star Wars Story ,  Sing ,  Passengers  and  Assassin s Creed . We believe
comparisons to films released during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015C (which included the highest grossing film of all time
   Star Wars: The Force Awakens ) may be challenging, but we are hopeful that this year s film product will
perform well. 

In addition, comparisons
to our fiscal 2015C fourth quarter will be negatively impacted by the fact that we had a 53rd week of operations during fiscal
2015C. Comparing the weeks included during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to the weeks included during the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2015C, the additional week of operations during fiscal 2015C consisted of five days at the end of September 2015 and the
last two days of December 2015, including New Year s Eve. Historically, September is not a particularly strong month at the
box office, but the last two days in December fall among one of the busiest movie-going weeks of the year   the week between
Christmas and New Year s Day. Revenues for the theatre business and the motion picture industry in general are heavily dependent
on the general audience appeal of available films, together with studio marketing, advertising and support campaigns and the maintenance
of the current  windows  between the date a film is released in theatres and the date a motion picture is released
to other channels, including video on-demand and DVD. These are factors over which we have no control. 

We ended the first
three quarters of fiscal 2016 with a total of 659 company-owned screens in 51 theatres and 11 managed screens in two theatres,
compared to 664 company-owned screens in 52 theatres and 11 managed screens in two theatres at the end of the first three quarters
of fiscal 2015C. We closed one six-screen budget-oriented theatre during the third quarter of fiscal 2015C and one seven-screen
budget-oriented theatre during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015C. We also opened two new  Ultra Screen DLX auditoriums at
an existing theatre in Minnesota in February 2016. We converted five more theatres to all-DreamLounger recliner seating during
March and April 2016 and converted two additional theatres in October 2016, increasing our percentage of auditoriums with recliner
seating to 48% - a percentage we believe to be the highest among the top chains in the United States. We opened one new  Zaffiro s
Express  and two new  Reel Sizzle  lobby dining outlets during the second quarter of fiscal 2016, two new  Zaffiro s
Express  and one  Take Five Lounge  outlets during the third quarter of fiscal 2016, and we expect to open three new 
Zaffiro s Express  and two new  Reel Sizzle  outlets during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 (including the Country
Club Hills Cinema described below). We also completed conversion of one  Ultra Screen to an  Ultra Screen DLX during
October 2016 and are in the process of converting three additional screens to  Super Screen DLX auditoriums at two existing
theatres. Two new screens are currently under construction at our Marcus Palace Cinema in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, and we expect
the screens to open in late November 2016. 

25   

In April 2016, we purchased
a closed 16-screen theatre in Country Club Hills, Illinois, which is now our sixth theatre in the greater Chicago area, building
on our strong presence in the Chicago southern suburbs. The purchase was part of an Internal Revenue Code  1031 like-kind
exchange in which the tax gain from our October 2015 sale of the real estate related to the Hotel Phillips was deferred by reinvesting
the applicable proceeds in replacement real estate within a prescribed time period. We opened the newly renovated theatre early
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The renovation added DreamLounger recliner seating to all auditoriums, added one  Ultra Screen
DLX auditorium and two  Super Screen DLX auditoriums, as well as a  Take Five Lounge  and  Reel Sizzle  outlet.
We have also commenced construction of a new 10-screen theatre in Shakopee, Minnesota and our first stand-alone all in-theatre
dining location, which will be an eight-screen theatre in Greendale, Wisconsin. We also will consider additional acquisitions of
existing theatres or theatre circuits when the right opportunities arise. 

Hotels and Resorts  

The following table
sets forth revenues, operating income and operating margin for our hotels and resorts division for the third quarter and first
three quarters of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015C (in millions, except for variance percentage and operating margin): 

Hotels and resorts
division revenues decreased 3.4% and 1.6% during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, respectively, compared
to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C due to decreased food and beverage revenues at our existing company-owned
hotels and the negative impact on total revenues resulting from our sale of the Hotel Phillips in October 2015, partially offset
by increased room revenues at our remaining eight company-owned hotels. The fact that the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C
included New Year s Eve, which is historically a strong holiday for many of our hotels, particularly for our food and beverage
outlets, and a lack of snow during the first quarter of fiscal 2016 which negatively impacted our ski operations at our Grand Geneva
Resort   Spa, contributed to our reduced total revenues during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. Conversely, our acquisition
of the  SafeHouse   restaurant in June 2015 favorably impacted hotels and resorts division food and beverage revenues
during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2015C. Excluding the  SafeHouse  and
Hotel Phillips from both years, our comparable hotels and resorts revenues increased 0.3% and 2.1%, respectively, during the third
quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. 

26   

Hotels and resorts
division operating income decreased by 5.8% during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015C
due primarily to decreased food and beverage revenues at our existing company-owned hotels and the negative impact on total operating
income resulting from our sale of the Hotel Phillips in October 2015. Hotels and resorts division operating income increased by
48.5% during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C due primarily to strong
cost controls and increased revenue per available room at our company-owned hotels. Our operating margin during the third quarter
and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 was 17.0% and 9.1%, respectively, compared to operating margins of 17.4% and 6.0%, respectively,
during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. Comparisons to our fiscal 2015C first three quarters results
benefited from the fact that, during the majority of the first half of fiscal 2015C, our AC Hotel Chicago Downtown was undergoing
a major renovation and was operating without a brand. In addition, hotels and resorts division operating income during the fiscal
2015C periods was negatively impacted by a $2.6 million impairment charge related to one specific hotel. Excluding the  SafeHouse 
and Hotel Phillips from both years, as well as the aforementioned impairment charge during fiscal 2015C, our comparable hotels
and resorts division operating income decreased 1.9% and increased 28.7%, respectively, during the third quarter and first three
quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. Excluding these same items, our
operating margin during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 was 17.4% and 9.6%, respectively, compared to
operating margins of 17.8% and 7.6%, respectively, during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. 

The following table
sets forth certain operating statistics for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015C, including
our average occupancy percentage (number of occupied rooms as a percentage of available rooms), our average daily room rate, or
ADR, and our total revenue per available room, or RevPAR, for company-owned properties: 

(1)  These operating statistics represent averages of our eight distinct comparable company-owned hotels
and resorts, branded and unbranded, in different geographic markets with a wide range of individual hotel performance. The statistics
are not necessarily representative of any particular hotel or resort.   

RevPAR increased at
five of our eight company-owned properties during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and six of our eight company-owned properties
during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. According
to data received from Smith Travel Research and compiled by us in order to evaluate our results for the third quarter and first
three quarters of fiscal 2016, comparable  upper upscale  hotels throughout the United States experienced an increase
in RevPAR of 2.3% and 2.4%, respectively, during our fiscal 2016 third quarter and first three quarters compared to our fiscal
2015C third quarter and first three quarters. In comparison, data received from Smith Travel Research for our various  competitive
sets    hotels identified in our specific markets that we deem to be competitors to our hotels   indicates that
these hotels experienced an increase in RevPAR of 1.7% and 2.5%, respectively, during our fiscal 2016 third quarter and first three
quarters. 

27   

We believe our RevPAR
increases and outperformance of the industry during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third
quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2015C were primarily the result of our continued emphasis on increasing our ADR, as
described below. Reduced group business negatively impacted several of our hotels during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and resulted
in a corresponding reduction in food and beverage revenues during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter
of fiscal 2015C. Conversely, additional group and transient business during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 contributed
to our improved results for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C, as evidenced
by our increase in occupancy percentage. Our company-owned hotels also experienced an increase in group room revenue bookings for
future periods during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to advanced group bookings during the third quarter of fiscal 2015C
  something commonly referred to in the hotels and resorts industry as  group pace.  

Our ADR increases in
the current year periods were the direct result of a strategy at several hotels to emphasize rate, occasionally at the expense
of occupancy. However, reduced group business during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015C
resulted in only four of our eight company-owned hotels reporting increased ADR during the fiscal 2016 third quarter, as we increased
the number of rooms occupied at discounted rates. Conversely, the additional group business at several of our hotels during the
first three quarters of fiscal 2016 allowed us to increase rates for the remaining available rooms and reduce the number of rooms
occupied at discounted rates. As a result, six of our eight company-owned and operated hotels reported increased ADR during the
first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. 

We completed a
renovation of The Skirvin Hilton hotel in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, which included all of the guest rooms and key public
spaces, during the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Operating results at this hotel were negatively impacted by the disruption
during the renovation. The AC Hotel Chicago Downtown is now in its second year of operation and achieved increased operating
performance during the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to the third quarter and first three
quarters of fiscal 2015C. We recently began construction on a project that will add 29 spacious, all-season villas to the
Grand Geneva Resort   Spa in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. This multi-million dollar investment is designed to enhance the
resort experience for travelers who want expanded, upscale accommodations and will increase our total combined units at this
top Midwest destination property to more than 600 (including the Timber Ridge Lodge) when the Villas open in mid-2017. 

28   

Whether the current
relatively positive trends in the hotel industry as a whole continue depends in large part on the economic environment in which
we operate, as hotel revenues have historically tracked very closely with traditional macroeconomic statistics, such as the Gross
Domestic Product. We also continue to monitor hotel supply in our markets, as increased supply without a corresponding increase
in demand may have a negative impact on our results. 

Comparisons to our
fiscal 2015C fourth quarter will be negatively impacted by the fact that we had a 53rd week of operations during fiscal 2015C.
Comparing the weeks included during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 to the weeks included during the fourth quarter of fiscal
2015C, the additional week of operations during fiscal 2015C consisted of five days at the end of September 2015 and the last two
days of December 2015, including New Year s Eve. Historically, September is a strong month for our hotels and resorts division
and New Year s Eve is a particularly strong day, especially for our food and beverage revenues. 

We also expect to continue
to explore opportunities to monetize selected existing company-owned hotels. We will consider many factors as we actively review
opportunities to execute this strategy, including income tax considerations, the ability to retain management, pricing and individual
market considerations. Conversely, we have a number of additional potential growth opportunities that we are currently evaluating.
The timing and nature of the opportunities may vary and include pure management contracts, management contracts with equity, and
joint venture investments. Both of these strategies may take time to execute and are generally dependent upon a favorable hotel
transactional market, over which we have no control. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Liquidity  

Our movie theatre and
hotels and resorts divisions each generate significant and consistent daily amounts of cash, subject to previously-noted seasonality,
because each segment s revenue is derived predominantly from consumer cash purchases. We believe that these relatively consistent
and predictable cash sources, as well as the availability of approximately $136 million of unused credit lines as of the end of
our fiscal 2016 third quarter, will be adequate to support the ongoing operational liquidity needs of our businesses during the
next 12 months. 

On June 16, 2016, we
replaced our then existing credit agreement, consisting of a $37 million term loan and a $175 million revolving credit facility,
by entering into a new five-year, $225 million credit agreement among us and several banks, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
as Administrative Agent, and U.S. Bank National Association, as Syndication Agent (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit
Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility that matures on June 16, 2021 with an initial maximum aggregate amount of availability
of $225 million. Availability under the revolving credit facility is reduced by outstanding commercial paper borrowings (none as
of September 29, 2016) and outstanding letters of credit ($3.4 million as of September 29, 2016). We may request to increase the
aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility and/or term loan commitments under the Credit Agreement, including by the addition
of one or more tranches of term loans, by an aggregate amount of up to $75 million, subject to certain conditions, which include,
among other things, the absence of any default or event of default under the Credit Agreement. 

29   

Under the Credit Agreement,
we have agreed to pay a facility fee, payable quarterly, equal to 0.15% to 0.25% of the total commitment, depending on our consolidated
debt to total capitalization ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest,
payable no less frequently than quarterly, at a rate equal to (a) LIBOR plus a specified margin between 0.85% and 1.375% (based
on our consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio) or (b) an alternate base rate (which is the greatest of (i) the Administrative
Agent s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (iii) the sum of 1% plus one-month LIBOR) plus a margin (based
upon our consolidated debt to capitalization ratio) specified in the Credit Agreement. 

The Credit Agreement
contains various restrictions and covenants applicable to The Marcus Corporation and certain of our subsidiaries. Among other requirements,
the Credit Agreement limits the amount of priority debt (as defined in the Credit Agreement) held by our restricted subsidiaries
to no more than 20% of our consolidated total capitalization (as defined in the Credit Agreement), limits our permissible consolidated
debt to total capitalization ratio to a maximum of 0.55 to 1.0 and requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio
(consolidated adjusted cash flow to consolidated interest and rental expense) of 3.0 to 1.0, as defined in the Credit Agreement. 

As of September 29,
2016, we were in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Credit Agreement. As of September 29, 2016, our consolidated
debt to total capitalization ratio was 0.35 and our fixed charge coverage ratio was 7.4. We expect to be able to meet the financial
covenants contained in the Credit Agreement during the remainder of fiscal 2016.    

Financial Condition  

Net cash provided by
operating activities totaled $44.8 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, compared to $41.2 million during the
first three quarters of the fiscal 2015C. The increase of $3.6 million in net cash provided by operating activities was due primarily
to increased net earnings and the favorable timing in the collection of accounts and notes receivable and payment of accounts payable
and accrued compensation, partially offset by the unfavorable timing in the payment of income taxes and other accrued liabilities
during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. 

Net cash used in investing
activities during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 totaled $40.3 million, compared to $58.4 million during the first three
quarters of fiscal 2015C. The largest contributor to the decrease in net cash used in investing activities was a $12.5 million
decrease in restricted cash during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016. When we sold the Hotel Phillips in October 2015, the
majority of the cash proceeds were held by an intermediary in conjunction with an anticipated Internal Revenue Code  1031
like-kind exchange, whereby we planned to subsequently purchase other real estate in order to defer the related tax gain on the
sale of the hotel. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, we successfully reinvested the proceeds in additional real estate
within the prescribed time period and we received the cash held by the intermediary, thereby reducing restricted cash. 

30   

The decrease in net
cash used in investing activities was also the result of a small decrease in capital expenditures, as well as our sale of an interest
in a joint venture (related to the Hotel Zamora located in St. Pete Beach, Florida) during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016
and the purchase of an interest in a joint venture during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. Total cash capital expenditures
(including normal continuing capital maintenance and renovation projects) totaled $58.1 million during the first three quarters
of fiscal 2016 compared to $59.1 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. Approximately $17.1 million of our capital
expenditures during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 were related to real estate purchases and development costs for three
new theatres, one of which opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and two of which are currently under construction. Approximately
$14.4 million of our capital expenditures during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C were related to the development of a
new theatre that opened in May 2015. We did not incur any significant acquisition-related capital expenditures during the first
three quarters of fiscal 2016 or the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. 

Cash capital expenditures
during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 included approximately $49.5 million of capital expenditures incurred in our theatre
division, including costs associated with several previously-described projects (including DreamLounger recliner seating additions,
new  Ultra Screen DLX and  Super Screen DLX auditoriums and new  Zaffiro s Express, Take Five Lounge  and
 Reel Sizzle  outlets), as well as new theatre costs noted above. We also incurred capital expenditures in our hotels and
resorts division during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 of approximately $8.4 million, including costs associated with
the renovation of the  SafeHouse  and The Skirvin Hilton. Cash capital expenditures during the first three quarters of fiscal
2015C included approximately $40.3 million of capital expenditures that we incurred in our theatre division, including costs associated
with a new theatre in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin and various DreamLounger recliner seating additions, as well as new premium large
format screens and  Take Five Lounge  and  Zaffiro s Express  outlets. We also incurred capital expenditures in
our hotels and resorts division during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C of approximately $18.3 million, including costs
associated with the renovation of the AC Hotel Chicago Downtown and our purchase of the  SafeHouse . 

Net cash used in financing
activities during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 totaled $5.3 million, compared to net cash provided by financing activities
during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C of $3.3 million. We used excess cash during both periods to reduce our borrowings
under our revolving credit facility. As short-term borrowings became due, we replaced them as necessary with new short-term borrowings.
In conjunction with the execution of our new Credit Agreement in June 2016, we also paid all outstanding borrowings under our old
revolving credit facility and replaced them with borrowings under our new revolving credit facility. As a result, we added $250.2
million of new short-term borrowings and we made $191.2 million of repayments on short-term borrowings during the first three quarters
of fiscal 2016 (net increase in borrowings on our credit facilities of $59.0 million) compared to $167.0 million of new short-term
borrowings and $150.0 million of repayments on short-term borrowings made during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C (net
increase in borrowings on our credit facilities of $17.0 million). We made $51.9 million of principal payments on long-term debt
during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, including our repayment of a $37.2 million term loan from our prior credit agreement,
compared to principal payments of $6.3 million during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. Our debt-to-capitalization ratio
was 0.38 at September 29, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

31   

We repurchased approximately
331,000 shares of our common stock for approximately $6.3 million in the open market or in conjunction with the exercise of stock
options during the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, compared to 52,000 shares repurchased for approximately $1.0 million in
conjunction with the exercise of stock options during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. As of September 29, 2016, approximately
2.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under prior Board of Directors repurchase authorizations. We expect that we
will execute any future repurchases on the open market or in privately-negotiated transactions, depending upon a number of factors,
including prevailing market conditions. 

Dividend payments during
the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 totaled $9.0 million compared to dividend payments of $8.2 million during the first three
quarters of fiscal 2015C. The increase in dividend payments was the result of a 10.5% increase in our regular quarterly dividend
payment initiated during May 2015 and an additional 7.1% increase in our regular quarterly dividend payment initiated in March
2016. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, we made distributions to noncontrolling interests of $448,000, compared to
$505,000 during the first three quarters of fiscal 2015C. 

We believe our total
capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 may approximate $75-80 million, barring any growth opportunities that could arise in the remaining
months and depending upon the timing of payments on several of the various projects incurred by our two divisions. Some of the
payments on projects undertaken during fiscal 2016 may carry over to fiscal 2017. The actual timing and extent of the implementation
of all of our current expansion plans will depend in large part on industry and general economic conditions, our financial performance
and available capital, the competitive environment, evolving customer needs and trends, and the availability of attractive opportunities.
We expect that our plans will continue to evolve and change in response to these and other factors. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

We have not experienced
any material changes in our market risk exposures since December 31, 2015. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 

a.             Evaluation of disclosure
controls and procedures  

Based on their evaluations and
the evaluation of management, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15

required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms. 

32   

b.            Changes in internal
control over financial reporting  

There were no significant changes
in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rule 13a-15 of the
Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
