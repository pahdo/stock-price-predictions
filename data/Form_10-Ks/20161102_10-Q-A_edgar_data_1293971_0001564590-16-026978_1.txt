This Section 6.10 will be subject to any right granted by either Party to any Third Party, provided that the grant of such right to such Third Party does not conflict with the other Party s rights or the first Party s obligations under this License Agreement.

  and assigns (collectively,    Celgene Indemnitees   ), and defend and save each of them harmless, from and against any and all Losses in connection with any and all Third Party Claims against Celgene Indemnitees arising from or occurring as a result of: (i) the material breach by Bluebird of any term of this License Agreement; (ii) any gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of Bluebird in performing its obligations under this License Agreement; or (iii) the Development by or on behalf of Bluebird or any of its Affiliates or Sublicensees of Elected Candidate or Licensed Product, except in each case for those Losses for which Celgene has an obligation to indemnify Bluebird pursuant to Section 9.6(a), as to which Losses each Party will indemnify the other to the extent of their respective liability for the Losses; provided, however, that Bluebird will not be obligated to indemnify Celgene Indemnitees for any Losses to the extent that such Losses arise as a result of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of a Celgene Indemnitee.  
   (c)   Notice of Claim .  All indemnification claims provided for in Sections 9.6(a) and 9.6(b) will be made solely by such Party to this License Agreement (the   Indemnified Party  ).  The Indemnified Party will promptly notify the indemnifying Party (an   Indemnification Claim Notice  ) of any Losses or the discovery of any fact upon which the Indemnified Party intends to base a request for indemnification under Sections 9.6(a) and 9.6(b), but in no event will the indemnifying Party be liable for any Losses that result from any delay in providing such notice.  Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and estimated amount of such Loss (to the extent that the nature and amount of such Loss is known at such time).  The Indemnified Party will furnish promptly to the indemnifying Party copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any Losses and Third Party Claims. 
   (d)   Defense, Settlement, Cooperation and Expenses . 
     (i)   Control of Defense  .  At its option, the indemnifying Party may assume the defense of any Third Party Claim by giving written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the indemnifying Party s receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice, provided however that (A) the Third Party Claim solely seeks monetary damages and (B) the indemnifying Party expressly agrees in writing that as between the indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, the indemnifying Party will be solely obligated to satisfy and discharge the Third Party Claim in full and is able to reasonably demonstrate that it has sufficient financial resources (the matters described in (A) and (B), the    Litigation Conditions   ).  The assumption of the defense of a Third Party Claim by the indemnifying Party will not be construed as an acknowledgment that the indemnifying Party is liable to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of the Third Party Claim, nor will it constitute a waiver by the indemnifying Party of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified Party s claim for indemnification.  Upon assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying Party may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the Third Party Claim any legal counsel selected by the indemnifying Party (the indemnifying Party will consult with the Indemnified Party with respect to a possible conflict of interest of such counsel retained by the indemnifying Party).  In the event the indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will immediately deliver to the indemnifying Party all original notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party in connection with the Third Party Claim.  Should the indemnifying Party assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, except as provided in Section 9.6(d)(ii), the indemnifying Party will not be liable to the

  Indemnified Party for any legal costs or expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third Party Claim.  The Indemnified Party may, at any time, assume the defense of a Third Party Claim if at any time the Litigation Conditions are not satisfied with respect to such Claim.  In the event that it is ultimately determined that the indemnifying Party is not obligated to indemnify, defend or hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and against the Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will reimburse the indemnifying Party for any and all costs and expenses (including attorneys  fees and costs of suit) and any Third Party Claims incurred by the indemnifying Party in its defense of the Third Party Claim.  
     (ii)   Right to Participate in Defense  .  Without limiting Section 9.6(d)(i), any Indemnified Party will be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third Party Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such employment will be at the Indemnified Party s own cost and expense unless (A) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying Party in writing, (B) the indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 9.6(d)(i) (in which case the Indemnified Party will control the defense), (C) the interests of the Indemnified Party and the indemnifying Party with respect to such Third Party Claim are sufficiently adverse to prohibit the representation by the same counsel of both Parties under applicable Law, ethical rules or equitable principles, or (D) the indemnifying Party no longer satisfies the Litigation Conditions, in which case the indemnifying Party will assume [***] percent ([***]) of any such costs and expenses of counsel for the Indemnified Party.  
 (iii)   Settlement  .  With respect to any Third Party Claims that relate solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third Party Claim and that will not result in the Indemnified Party s becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affecting the business of the Indemnified Party in any manner, and as to which the indemnifying Party will have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder, and subject to the Litigation Conditions being satisfied, the indemnifying Party will have the sole right to agree to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss, on such terms as the indemnifying Party, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate.  With respect to all other Losses in connection with Third Party Claims, where the indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section 9.6(d)(i), the indemnifying Party will have authority to agree to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such Loss provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).  The indemnifying Party will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a Loss by an Indemnified Party that is reached without the prior written consent of the indemnifying Party.  Regardless of whether the indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, no Indemnified Party will admit any liability with respect to or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.  
   (iv)   Cooperation  .  If the indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will, and will cause each other Indemnified Party to,

  cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith.  Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to indemnifying Party to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified Party of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and making Indemnified Parties and other employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses in connection therewith.  
 (v)   Costs and Expenses  .  Except as provided above in this Section 9.6(d), the costs and expenses, including attorneys  fees and expenses, incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with any claim will be reimbursed on a calendar quarter basis by the indemnifying Party, without prejudice to the indemnifying Party s right to contest the Indemnified Party s right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the indemnifying Party is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party.  
           9.7   Insurance     .  Each Party will maintain at its sole cost and expense, an adequate liability insurance or self-insurance program (including product liability insurance) to protect against potential liabilities and risk arising out of activities to be performed under this License Agreement, and any agreement related hereto and upon such terms (including coverages, deductible limits and self-insured retentions) as are customary in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry for the activities to be conducted by such Party under this License Agreement.  Subject to the preceding sentence, such liability insurance or self-insurance program will insure against all types of liability, including personal injury, physical injury or property damage arising out of the manufacture, sale, use, distribution or marketing of Licensed Product.  The coverage limits set forth herein will not create any limitation on a Party s liability to the other under this License Agreement. 
                 10.   Term and Termination  .  
           10.1   Term .  This License Agreement will commence as of the License Agreement Effective Date and, unless sooner terminated in accordance with the terms hereof or by mutual written consent, will continue on a country-by-country basis, until there are no more payments owed Bluebird on Licensed Product in such country (the longest such period of time for any Licensed Product hereunder, the   License Agreement Term  ).  Upon there being no more such payments hereunder for any such Licensed Product in such country, the licenses contained in Section 3.1 for such Licensed Product will become fully paid up and will remain exclusive with respect to such Licensed Product in such country. 
         10.2   Termination by Bluebird . 
         (a)   Breach .  Bluebird will have the right to terminate this License Agreement in full upon delivery of written notice to Celgene in the event of any material breach by Celgene of any terms and conditions of this License Agreement in a manner that fundamentally frustrates the transactions contemplated by this License Agreement, provided that such termination will not be effective if such breach, has been cured within [***] after written notice thereof is given by Bluebird to Celgene specifying the nature of the alleged breach (or, if such default cannot be cured

In the event Celgene intends to assert a Patent Challenge in any forum, not less than [***] prior to making any such assertion, Celgene will provide to Bluebird a complete written disclosure of each basis known to Celgene for such assertion.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Bluebird s termination right under this Section 10.2(b) will not apply to any Affiliate of Celgene that first becomes an Affiliate of Celgene after the Effective Date of this License Agreement in connection with a Business Combination, where such Affiliate of Celgene was undertaking activities in connection with a Patent Challenge prior to such Business Combination; provided   however   that Celgene causes such Patent Challenge to terminate within forty-five (45) days after such Business Combination. 
       10.3   Termination by Celgene   . 
   (a)   Breach .

Bluebird will pay all costs incurred by either Party to complete such studies should Bluebird request that such studies be completed. 
   (b)   Sublicenses .  A termination of this License Agreement will not automatically terminate any sublicense granted by Celgene pursuant to Section 3.3 for Commercialization rights with respect to a non-Affiliated Sublicensee, provided that (i) such Sublicensee is not then (A) in material breach of any provision of this License Agreement or (B) in material breach of the applicable sublicense agreement or otherwise in breach of such sublicense agreement in a manner that would give rise to a right of termination on the part of Celgene, (ii) if Bluebird terminates this License Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2(a) for Celgene s failure to fulfill its payment obligations hereunder, such Sublicensee agrees to and does pay to Bluebird all outstanding amounts that accrued as a result of such Sublicensee s activities under the sublicense, (iii) Bluebird will have the right to step into the role of Celgene as sublicensor under any such sublicense executed after the License Agreement Effective Date, with all the rights that Celgene had under such sublicense, solely with respect to the Licensed IP, prior to termination of this License Agreement (including the right to receive any payments to Celgene by such Sublicensee that accrue from and after the date of the termination of this License Agreement solely with respect to the Licensed IP), (iv) such Sublicensee will pay to Bluebird all amounts that Celgene would have been obligated to pay to Bluebird hereunder with respect to such Sublicensee s activities had this License Agreement not terminated (less any amounts received by Bluebird in clause (iii) above) and (v) the survival of such sublicense will not result in an imposition of any additional obligations on the part of Bluebird that are not included within the scope of this License Agreement.  Celgene will include in any sublicense agreement executed after the License Agreement Effective Date that relates solely to the Licensed IP a provision in which said Sublicensee acknowledges its obligations to Bluebird under this Section 10.4(b).

 Press Release 

bluebird   bio Announces First   Patient Treated with bb2121 in CRB-401 Phase 1   Study in Patients with   Relapsed/Refractory   Multiple Myeloma 
   
 Celgene has agreed to exercise its option to exclusively license bb2121 under global   strategic collaboration 
 bluebird bio to receive $10 million option exercise payment from Celgene 
   
 Cambridge, MA,   February 17, 2016      bluebird     bio,     Inc.     (Nasdaq:     BLUE),   a   clinical-     stage     company     committed to   developing     potentially     transformative     gene therapies   for     severe     genetic diseases   and T   cell-based     immunotherapies   for   cancer,     announced     treatment   of     the     first   patient   in a   Phase   1 study     of   its   product     candidate   bb2121 in   patients     with     relapsed/refractory     multiple   myeloma.   bb2121 is a   chimeric antigen     receptor   T     cell     (CAR     T)   therapy     targeting B     cell     maturation     antigen     (BCMA),     and   bluebird bio is     developing     bb2121 in     collaboration     with     Celgene     Corporation.     bluebird   bio   also     announced   today     that   Celgene has     exercised   its option to exclusively     license     bb2121,     under   the   terms   of     the   collaboration     agreement     between   the   two     companies.  
  bb2121 is bluebird bio s first oncology   program  to  enter the clinic,   and the   treatment of   this first patient marks an   important milestone for us as we build a broad, fully   integrated   T cell immunotherapy   franchise,  said Nick   Leschly, chief bluebird.  We   are pleased that   Celgene has exercised their option to license bb2121. We believe our combined   manufacturing, development and commercial expertise will enable us to rapidly   advance   bb2121 through   clinical trials.  
  Despite many   recent advances in the field, multiple myeloma   remains incurable, with   almost all patients becoming   refractory   to therapy   eventually,  said James N.   Kochenderfer, M.D., National Cancer   Institute, an   investigator for the CRB-401 study.    BCMA is one of the most exciting   targets in multiple myeloma,   and we   are eager to   explore the potential of bb2121 to become an important new treatment option for patients   living   with multiple myeloma.  
 bluebird bio and Celgene   amended and   restated their collaboration agreement in June   2015 to focus on developing   product candidates targeting BCMA during   a three-year   collaboration term.    By    exercising   its exclusive option under the terms of the   agreement,   Celgene will be responsible for worldwide development and commercialization of   bb2121 after Phase 1. bluebird bio is responsible for the development of bb2121 through   the completion of the CRB-401 Phase 1 study   and   has an option to share in   the   development, promotion and profits in the United   States. bluebird bio will receive   a $10   million option exercise payment from Celgene,   and bluebird bio is also eligible to receive   specified development, regulatory   and commercial milestone payments and   royalty   payments on net sales.

About the CRB-401 Study 
   
 The primary   objective of   the CRB-401 study   is to   evaluate the maximum tolerated dose   of bb2121 and determine   the recommended Phase   2 dose. The secondary   objective is   patient response, measured using   the   International   Myeloma Working   Group (IMWG)   Response Criteria for Multiple Myeloma. The   first portion of the study   includes a dose-   escalation phase in which cohorts of patients will receive ascending   doses   of bb2121 to   determine the maximum tolerated dose   and establish a recommended Phase   2 dose.

 PATENT LICENSE AGREEMENT    EXCLUSIVE  
 COVER PAGE 
 For the  NIH  internal use only: 
 License Number: L-224-2015/0 
 License Application Number:   A-107-2014  
 Serial Number(s) of Licensed Patent(s) or Patent Application(s): 
   
 [***] 

Licensee:      bluebird bio, Inc.  
   
 Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) Number (if a subject invention):  n/a  
   
 Additional Remarks:     none  
   
 Public Benefit(s):     
   
 Autologous cell therapy has shown the potential to result in a significant and durable clinical benefit to patients with advanced tumors; the newest iteration of this approach uses engineered chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) to activate T cell response to the tumor. B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is an attractive target for application of CAR technology due to its expression in different tumor types (especially hematological cancers) and lack of expression in non-transformed tissues; therefore, development of BCMA CAR products by the  Licensee , in partnership with the  NIH , has the potential to generate new, efficacious, and safe therapies for patients that have not responded to all other therapies.

 This  Agreement  is effective when signed by all parties, unless the provisions of Paragraph 14.16 are not fulfilled, and shall extend to the expiration of the last to expire of the  Licensed Patent Rights  unless sooner terminated as provided in this Article 13.    

13.2   
 
   In the event that the  Licensee  is in default in the performance of any material obligations under this  Agreement , including but not limited to the obligations listed in Paragraph 13.5, and if the default has not been remedied within [***] after the date of notice in writing of the default, the  NIH  may terminate this  Agreement  by written notice and pursue outstanding royalties owed through procedures provided by the Federal Debt Collection Act.    

13.3   
 
 In the event that the  Licensee  becomes insolvent, files a petition in bankruptcy, has such a petition filed against it, or receives notice of a third party's intention to file an involuntary petition in bankruptcy, the  Licensee  shall immediately notify the  NIH  in writing.    

13.4   
 
 The  Licensee  shall have a unilateral right to terminate this  Agreement  or any licenses in any  Licensed Fields of Use  in any country or territory by giving the  NIH  [***] written notice to that effect.    

13.5   
 
 The  NIH  shall specifically have the right to terminate or modify, at its option, this  Agreement  by written notice to the  Licensee , if the  NIH  reasonably determines that the  Licensee :    

(a)   
 
 is not executing the  Commercial Development Plan  submitted with its request for a license and the  Licensee  cannot otherwise demonstrate to the  NIH s  satisfaction that the  Licensee  has taken, or can be expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve the  Practical Application  of the  Licensed Products  or the  Licensed Processes ;

(g)   
 
 cannot reasonably justify a failure to comply with the domestic production requirement of Paragraph 5.2 unless waived.  

13.6   
 
 In making the determination referenced in Paragraph 13.5, the  NIH  shall take into account the normal course of such commercial development programs conducted with sound and reasonable business practices and judgment and the annual reports submitted by the  Licensee  under Paragraph 9.2.  Prior to invoking termination or modification of this  Agreement  under Paragraph 13.5, the  NIH  shall give written notice to the  Licensee  providing the  Licensee  specific notice of, and a [***] opportunity to respond to, the  NIH s  concerns as to the items referenced in 13.5(a)-13.5(g).  If the  Licensee  fails to alleviate the  NIH s  concerns as to the items referenced in 13.5(a)-13.5(g) or within [***] following written notice from the  NIH  or otherwise fails to initiate corrective action to the  NIH s  satisfaction, the  NIH  may terminate this  Agreement  upon written notice to the  Licensee .    

13.7   
 
 When the public health and safety so require, and after written notice to the  Licensee  providing the  Licensee  a [***] opportunity to respond, the  NIH  shall have the right to require the  Licensee  to grant sublicenses to responsible applicants, on reasonable terms, in any  Licensed Fields of Use  under the  Licensed Patent Rights , unless the  Licensee  can reasonably demonstrate that the granting of the sublicense would not materially increase the availability to the public of the subject matter of the  Licensed Patent Rights .  The  NIH  shall not require the granting of a sublicense unless the responsible applicant has first negotiated in good faith with the  Licensee .    

13.8   
 
 The  NIH  reserves the right according to 35 U.S.C.  209(d)(3) to terminate or modify this  Agreement  upon written notice to the  Licensee  if it is determined that this action is necessary to meet the requirements for public use specified by federal regulations issued after the date of the license and these requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the  Licensee  within [***] following written notice from the  NIH .    

13.9   
 
 Within [***] of receipt of written notice of the  NIH's  unilateral decision to modify or terminate this  Agreement , the  Licensee  may, consistent with the provisions of 37 C.F.R.    404.11, appeal the decision by written submission to the designated  NIH  official.  The decision of the designated  NIH  official shall be the final agency decision.  The  Licensee  may thereafter exercise any and all administrative or judicial remedies that may be available.    

13.10   
 
 Within [***] of expiration or termination of this  Agreement  under this Article 13, a final report shall be submitted by the  Licensee .  Any royalty payments, including those incurred but not yet paid (such as the full minimum annual royalty), and those related to patent expenses, due to the  NIH  shall become immediately due and payable upon termination or expiration.  If terminated under this Article 13, sublicensees may elect to convert their sublicenses to direct licenses with the  NIH  pursuant to Paragraph 4.3.  Unless otherwise specifically provided for under this  Agreement , upon termination or expiration of this  Agreement , the  Licensee  shall have the right to offer for sale and sell any existing inventory of  Licensed Products  for a period of [***] following the effective termination date of this  Agreement , subject to the royalty obligations as set forth in Appendix C.

 Neither party may waive or release any of its rights or interests in this  Agreement  except in writing.

The transfer of these items may require a license from the appropriate agency of the U.S.   Government   or written assurances by the   Licensee   that it shall not export these items to certain foreign countries without prior approval of this agency.  The   NIH   neither represents that a license is or is not required or that, if required, it shall be issued.

Thereafter, the  Licensee  may exercise any administrative or judicial remedies that may be available.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement , the  Licensee  shall have the right, without waiving any right or remedy available under this  Agreement  or otherwise, to seek and obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary or desirable to protect the rights or property of the  Licensee , pending any such settlement or the determination of any such appeal.    

14.12   
 
 Nothing relating to the grant of a license, nor the grant itself, shall be construed to confer upon any person any immunity from or defenses under the antitrust laws or from a charge of patent misuse, and the acquisition and use of rights pursuant to 37 C.F.R. Part 404 shall not be immunized from the operation of state or Federal law by reason of the source of the grant.
