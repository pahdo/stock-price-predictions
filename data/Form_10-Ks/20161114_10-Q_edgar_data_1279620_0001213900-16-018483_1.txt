1    ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS    

Organization    

Zoned
Properties, Inc., formerly Vanguard Minerals Corporation ( Zoned Properties  or the  Company ), was incorporated
in the State of Nevada on August 25, 2003. On May 2, 2006, the Company changed its name to Knewtrino, Inc. On August 10, 2007,
the Company changed its name to Vanguard Minerals Corporation. On October 2, 2013, the Company changed its name to Zoned Properties,
Inc. to reflect its maturing business model that focuses on commercial property acquisition and development.  

The
Company is a strategic real estate development firm whose primary mission is to identify, develop, and lease sophisticated, safe,
and sustainable properties in emerging industries, including the licensed marijuana industry. The Company acquires commercial
properties that face unique zoning challenges and identifies solutions that can potentially have a major impact on the cash flow
and value generated. Zoned Properties targets commercial properties that can be acquired and potentially re-zoned for specific
purposes. Zoned Properties does not grow, harvest, sell or distribute cannabis or any substances regulated under United States
law such as the Controlled Substances Act.  

The
Company has the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Basis
of presentation and principals of consolidation   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared
by us without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows as of September 30,
2016 and 2015, and for the periods then ended, have been made. Those adjustments consist of normal and recurring adjustments.
Operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the fiscal year as a
whole.  

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include the collectability of rent, the useful life of rental properties and
property and equipment, assumptions used in assessing impairment of long-term assets, valuation allowances for deferred tax assets,
and the fair value of non-cash equity transactions, including options and stock-based compensation.  

Risks
and uncertainties   

The
Company s operations are subject to risk and uncertainties including financial, operational, regulatory and other risks
including the potential risk of business failure. The Company conducts a significant portion of its business in Arizona. Consequently,
any significant economic downturn in the Arizona market could potentially have an effect on the Company s business, results
of operations and financial condition.

  NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Fair
value of financial instruments   

The
carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents, note receivable, deferred rent receivable,
prepaid expenses and other current assets, real estate tax escrow, short-term notes payable, mortgages payable, convertible notes
payable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other payables approximate their fair market value based on the short-term maturity
of these instruments.  

The
Company analyzes all financial instruments with features of both liabilities and equity under the Financial Accounting Standard
Board s (the  FASB ) accounting standard for such instruments. Under this standard, financial assets and liabilities
are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company
did not identify any assets or liabilities that are required to be presented on the balance sheet at fair value in accordance
with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820.  

ASC
825-10  Financial Instruments , allows entities to voluntarily choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities
at fair value (fair value option). The fair value option may be elected on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable,
unless a new election date occurs. If the fair value option is elected for an instrument, unrealized gains and losses for that
instrument should be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date. The Company did not elect to apply the fair value
option to any outstanding instruments.  

Cash
and cash equivalents   

Cash
and cash equivalents are carried at cost and represent cash on hand, demand deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions
and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date of such investments.
The majority of the Company s cash and cash equivalents are held at major commercial banks, which may at times exceed the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) limit. To date, the Company has not experienced any losses on its invested
cash. The Company had no cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the Company had
approximately $360,000 of cash in excess of FDIC limits.  

Accounts
receivable   

The
Company recognizes an allowance for losses on accounts receivable in an amount equal to the estimated probable losses net of recoveries.
The allowance is based on an analysis of historical bad debt experience, current receivables aging, and expected future write-offs,
as well as an assessment of specific identifiable customer accounts considered at risk or uncollectible. The expense associated
with the allowance for doubtful accounts is recognized in general and administrative expense.  

Real
estate tax escrow   

Real
estate tax escrow consists of funds held for the purpose of real estate taxes owed. These funds will be released as required to
satisfy tax payments as due.  

Rental
properties   

Rental
properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renovations and certain costs
directly related to the improvement of rental properties are capitalized. Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 7
to 39 years. Tenant improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate
the useful lives of the assets.  

Upon
the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified
intangibles, such as acquired above-market leases and acquired in-place leases) and acquired liabilities (such as acquired below-market
leases) and allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow
projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash
flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. The
Company records acquired intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases and acquired in-place leases) and acquired
intangible liabilities (including below-market leases) at their estimated fair value. The Company amortizes acquired above-and
below-market leases as a decrease or increase to rental income, respectively, over the lives of the respective leases. Amortization
of acquired in-place leases is included as a component of depreciation and amortization. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, there were no acquired in-place leases.

  SEPTEMBER 30, 2016  

NOTE
2    SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)    

Rental
properties (continued)   

The
Company s properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the
carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted
basis. An impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property s carrying amount over its estimated fair value.
Impairment analyses are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the
analyses are prepared. If the Company s estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market
conditions change, the Company s evaluation of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material
to its consolidated financial statements. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions
regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold
properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company did not record any impairment losses.  

The
Company has capitalized land, which is not subject to depreciation.  

Property
and equipment   

Property
and equipment is stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided utilizing the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. The Company uses a five year life for office equipment, seven years for
furniture and fixtures, and 5 to 10 years for vehicles. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.
Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations.  

The
Company examines the possibility of decreases in the value of these assets when events or changes in circumstances reflect the
fact that their recorded value may not be recoverable.  

R evenue
recognition   

Rental
income includes base rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its respective lease and is reported on a straight-line
basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease, which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.
We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space or controls the physical use of the
leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. Rental income also includes the amortization of
acquired above-and below-market leases, net. Beginning in 2014, the Company began generating revenues from the non-residential
rental properties.  

Certain
of the Company s leases currently contain rental increases at specified intervals. The Company records as an asset, and
include in revenue,   rents   receivable that will be received if the tenant makes
all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. Deferred   rents   receivable
in the accompanying balance sheets includes the cumulative difference between rental revenue recorded on a straight-line basis
and rents received from the tenants in accordance with the lease terms. Accordingly, management determines to what extent the
deferred   rent   receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible.
The Company reviews material   rents   receivable and takes into consideration
the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant
operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of rent receivable
with respect to any given tenant is in doubt, we record an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts or the Company
records a direct write-off of the specific   rent   receivable. No such reserves
related to deferred rent receivable have been recorded as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, in connection with certain related party leases, the Company only included in revenues the amount of rents
received from the related parties in accordance with the lease terms. On August 1, 2015, the Company transferred title to its
Bernalillo, New Mexico property and the respective related party lease as part of a settlement agreement, and cancelled a related
party lease in June 2015.

Basic
income (loss) per share   

Basic
income (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during each period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number
of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. All potentially
dilutive common shares were excluded from the computation of diluted shares outstanding as they would have an anti-dilutive impact
on the Company s net losses and consisted of the following:  

Segment
reporting   

The
Company s business is comprised of one reportable segment. The Company has determined that its properties have similar economic
characteristics to be aggregated into one reportable segment (operating, leasing and managing commercial properties). The Company s
determination was based primarily on its method of internal reporting.  

Income
tax   

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and
liabilities, as measured by the enacted tax rates, which are expected to be in effect when these differences reverse. Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are classified as current or non-current, depending upon the classification of the asset or liabilities
to which they relate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities not related to an asset or liability are classified as current or non-current
depending on the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are established when
necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.  

The
Company follows the provisions of FASB ASC 740-10  Uncertainty in Income Taxes . Certain recognition thresholds must
be met before a tax position is recognized in the financial statements. An entity may only recognize or continue to recognize
tax positions that meet a  more-likely-than-not  threshold.  

The
Company does not believe it has any uncertain tax positions as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 that would require either recognition
or disclosure in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

Stock-based
compensation   

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting
period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based
on the grant-date fair value of the award.  

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
 measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is
reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. The Company initially records compensation expense based
on the fair value of the award at the reporting date.  

Related
parties   

Parties
are considered to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control,
are controlled by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company,
its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with
which the Company may deal with if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the
other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests.

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2014-09 )  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 establishes
a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes
most of the existing revenue recognition guidance and notes that lease contracts with customers are a scope exception. ASU 2014-09
requires an entity to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services and also requires certain additional
disclosures. On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Public business entities
may elect to adopt the amendments as of the original effective date; however, adoption is required for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial
statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going
Concern,  that will require management to assess an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related
footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In connection with each annual and interim period, management will assess if there
is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date. Substantial
doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the issuance date.
The new standard defines substantial doubt and provides example indicators. Disclosures will be required if conditions give rise
to substantial doubt. However, management will need to assess if its plans will alleviate substantial doubt to determine the specific
disclosures. This standard is effective for public entities for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016. Earlier application
of this standard is permitted. This standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ),
which requires entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet.
The ASU simplifies the current guidance in ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes , which requires entities to separately present deferred
tax assets and liabilities as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for all entities
as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company does not expect the impact of ASU 2015-17 to be material
to its consolidated financial statements.  

On
February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ) to amend the accounting guidance for leases. The
accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02. However, the standard requires lessees to recognize lease
assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases on the balance sheet. Lessees will recognize in the statement
of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election
by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it will recognize
lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance
on its consolidated financial statements and notes to its consolidated financial statements.  

On
March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ) to amend the accounting guidance for share-based payment
accounting. The areas for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, forfeitures, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption
is permitted.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material
effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

Reclassification   

Certain
reclassifications have been made in the prior period s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current period s

(C)
Equity Incentive Plan    

On
August 9, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan )
and reserved 10,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance thereunder. The 2016 Plan s purpose is to encourage ownership
in the Company by employees, officers, directors and consultants whose long-term service the Company considers essential to its
continued progress and, thereby, encourage recipients to act in the stockholders  interest and share in the Company s
success. The 2016 Plan authorizes the grant of awards in the form of options intended to qualify as incentive stock options under
Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code, options that do not qualify (non-statutory stock options) and grants of restricted shares
of common stock. Restricted shares granted pursuant to the 2016 Plan are amortized to expense over the three-year vesting period.
Options vest and expire over a period not to exceed seven years. If any share of common stock underlying a stock option that has
been granted ceases to be subject to a stock option, or if any shares of common stock that are subject to any other stock-based
award granted are forfeited or terminate, such shares shall again be available for distribution in connection with future grants
and awards under the 2016 Plan. As of September 30, 2016, no awards have been made under the 2016 Plan. At September 30, 2016,
10,000,000 shares are available for future issuance.  

The
Company also continues to maintain its 2014 Equity Compensation Plan (the  2014 Plan ), pursuant to which 1,250,000
previously awarded stock options are outstanding. The 2014 Plan has been superseded by the 2016 Plan. Accordingly, no additional
shares subject to the existing 2014 Plan will be issued and the 1,250,000 shares issuable upon exercise of stock options will
be issued pursuant to the 2014 Plan, if exercised. As of September 30, 2016, options to purchase 1,250,000 shares of common stock
are outstanding pursuant to the 2014 Plan.

Stock options granted pursuant to consulting and employment agreements    

On
May 6, 2015, the Company entered into a 36-month consulting agreement with a stockholder for business advisory services. In connection

an exercise price of $1.00 per share under the 2014 Plan. The options vest as to 125,000 of such shares on July 1, 2015 and for
each quarter thereafter through April 1, 2017, and expire on May 5, 2025 or earlier due to employment termination. The fair value
of this option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility of 120%; risk-free interest rate of 2.25%; and, an estimated holding period
of 10 years. In connection with these options, the Company valued these options at a fair value of $948,400 and will record stock-based
consulting expense over the vesting period. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded consulting
expense of $54,166 and $227,488, respectively, related to these options. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,

Stock options granted pursuant to consulting and employment agreements   (continued)  

In
connection with an employment agreement with a former officer of the Company, the Company granted options to purchase 300,000
shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share to the employee under the 2014 Plan. The options
vested as to 50,000 of such shares on August 1, 2015, and 50,000 options were to vest on May 1, 2016 and for each year thereafter
through May 1, 2020, and expire five years from the date of grant or earlier due to employment termination. The fair value of
these option grants was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average
assumptions: dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility of 120%; risk-free interest rate of 1.50%; and, an estimated holding period
of 5 years. In connection with these options, the Company valued these options at a fair value of $248,100 and was recording stock-based
consulting expense over the vesting period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded stock-based
compensation expense of $37,387 and $80,690 related to these options, respectively. In January 2016, the employee resigned and
the employment agreement was terminated. Accordingly, on January 8, 2016, 250,000 non-vested options were cancelled. Accordingly
upon termination, the Company reversed all stock-based compensation previously recognized on the non-vested stock options of $62,944
which was reflected as a reduction of compensation and benefits expense. Additionally, in April 2016, the remaining 50,000 vested
stock options were cancelled due to employment termination.  

On
December 30, 2015, the Company granted the Company s Chief Executive Officer and President an option, pursuant to the 2014
Plan, to purchase 250,000 of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share. The grant date of the option
was December 30, 2015 and the option expires on December 30, 2026. The option vests as to (i) 25,000 of such shares on December
30, 2015, and (ii) as to 25,000 of such shares on December 30, 2016 and each year thereafter through December 30, 2026. The fair
value of this option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions: dividend yield of 0%; expected volatility of 120%; risk-free interest rate of 2.31%; and, an estimated
holding period of 10 years. In connection with these options, the Company valued these options at a fair value of $237,150 and
will record stock-based compensation expense over the vesting period. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $16,772 and zero, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company recorded stock-based compensation expense of $50,317 and zero, respectively.  

At
September 30, 2016, there were 1,250,000 options outstanding and 650,000 options vested and exercisable. As of September 30, 2016,
there was $211,827 of unvested stock-based compensation expense to be recognized through December 2024. The aggregate intrinsic
value at September 30, 2016 was approximately $500,000 and was calculated based on the difference between the quoted share price
on September 30, 2016 and the exercise price of the underlying options.

Healing
Healthcare 3, Inc.; Xingang, LLC v. v. Zoned Properties, Inc., et al.; Court Filed: Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona; Case
Number: CV2015-012264; Date Filed: October 21, 2015.   

On
October 21, 2015, Healing Healthcare 3, Inc. ( HH3 ) and Xingang, LLC filed a complaint against the Company, President
and CEO Bryan McLaren, Board member Alex McLaren, and wholly-owned subsidiary Tempe Industrial Properties, LLC, among others.
The complaint concerned the Company s lease of space in Tempe, Arizona to operate a medical marijuana cultivation site.
HH3 and Xingang claim that the Company and its related parties violated the terms of the lease for various reasons. On May 23,
2014, the Company concluded that the lease had been breached, and terminated the lease and retook possession of the property.
Plaintiffs asserted various contract and tort claims against the Company and its related parties, and seeks $10,000 per day  for
each day that the Company remained in possession of the Tempe Property in violation of the Lease,  attorneys  fees
and costs, treble damages, punitive damages, and interest. The complaint was served on the Company and its related parties on
February 17, 2016. On March 8, 2016, the Company, Bryan McLaren, Alex McLaren, and TIP (the  Moving Parties ) filed
a motion to dismiss the claims asserted against them in the complaint, with prejudice, on various grounds. On April 14, 2016,
the court granted in part, and denied in part, the motion to dismiss. In sum, the court granted the dismissal of the contract
claims against the McLarens without leave to amend; denied the dismissal of the two contract claims against the Company and TIP;
and granted the dismissal of the remaining tort claims, subject to leave to amend the complaint within 20 days of the order. On
May 5, 2016, HH3 and Xingang filed an amended complaint with new fact allegations, reasserting the claims that had survived the
motion to dismiss. A motion to dismiss the amended complaint was filed on behalf of the Company, Bryan McLaren, and TIP. The motion
was fully-briefed, and by order dated July 8, 2016, the Court granted the motion to dismiss the claims asserted by Xingang but
denied the rest of the motion. The Company, Bryan McLaren, and TIP filed their answer to the amended complaint on July 27, 2016.
On or about November 8, 2016, the Company reached a settlement with Healing Healthcare 3, Inc. ( HH3 ) to settle the
lawsuit HH3 filed on October 21, 2015.  The terms of the settlement are confidential, but the lawsuit will be dismissed in
its entirety with prejudice.  

In
a letter dated April 4, 2016, a shareholder of the Company, through legal counsel, made a demand on the Company related to a certain
reverse-stock split that occurred following changes in the composition of the Company s officers and directors in 2014.
In its letter, this shareholder alleged, among other things, that: the reverse-stock split was designed to dilute existing Company
interests of existing shareholders and to further entrench new management s control over the Company. This shareholder demanded
that the board of directors bring a legal action against certain officers and directors and against the Company s transfer
agent for various alleged violations of federal and state law. This shareholder indicated its intent to file a putative shareholder
derivative action if its demand were not accepted. The Company evaluated this shareholder s demand and engaged in settlement
talks for several weeks. On July 15, 2016, the parties entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the
 Settlement Agreement ), whereby the Company agreed to issue an aggregate of 50,000 shares of its common stock as
follows: (a) 12,500 shares were issued within three days from execution of the Settlement Agreement, (b) 12,500 were issued on
September 30, 2016, (c) 12,500 shares shall be issued on December 30, 2016, and (d) 12,500 shares shall be issued on March 31,
2017. In connection with the Settlement Agreement, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded settlement
expense of $87,500.  

In
a letter dated May 10, 2016, Marc Brannigan, the Company s former CEO, and related parties (collectively  Brannigan )
sent a demand letter, through counsel, to the Company and certain other third-parties, claiming, among other things, that the
Company improperly diluted Brannigan s equity in the Company. Brannigan demands that the Company issue shares to  reverse 
the dilution, invalidate shares improperly issued by the Company, pay unspecified damages, recover one-third of all Company shares
owned by Alan Abrams and Chris Carra, and recover Brannigan s purported majority ownership and voting control of the Company.
The Company has evaluated Brannigan s purported claims, and intends to vigorously defend against such claim. A mediation
involving all interested parties occurred on July 29, 2016 and was unsuccessful.

Item
2: Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Cautionary
Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information and Factors That May Affect Future Results   

This
quarterly report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations
and prospects. The Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) encourages companies to disclose forward-looking
information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions.
This quarterly report on Form 10-Q and other written and oral statements that we make from time to time contain such forward-looking
statements that set out anticipated results based on management s plans and assumptions regarding future events or performance.
We have tried, wherever possible, to identify such statements by using words such as  anticipate,   estimate, 
 expect,   project,   intend,   plan,   believe,   will 
and similar expressions in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
statements relating to future actions, future performance or results of current and anticipated sales efforts, expenses, the outcome
of contingencies, such as legal proceedings, and financial results. Factors that could cause our actual results of operations
and financial condition to differ materially are set forth in the  Risk Factors  section of our annual report on Form
10-K as filed with the SEC on March 8, 2016, as the same may be updated from time to time in documents that we file with the SEC.  

We
caution that these factors could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to differ materially from those
expressed in any forward-looking statements we make and that investors should not place undue reliance on any such forward-looking
statements. Further, any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake
no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement
is made or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances. New factors emerge from time to
time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of such factors. Further, we cannot assess the impact of each such factor on
our results of operations or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially
from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere
in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  

Business
and Corporate History   

We
are a strategic real estate development firm whose primary mission is to identify, develop, and lease sophisticated, safe, and
sustainable properties in emerging industries, including the licensed marijuana industry. Our vision is to be recognized for creating
the standard in property development for emerging industries, while increasing community prosperity and shareholder value. We
believe that a strong focus on the development of real estate properties will bring value to the local communities and all of
our stakeholders. We have initially established a focus on properties within the medical marijuana industry because we believe
there will be increasing demand in this industry, as the national industry continues to evolve.  

We
target commercial properties that can be acquired and potentially re-zoned for specific development purposes, including but not
limited to, licensed medical marijuana dispensaries or cultivation facilities. The core of our business involves identifying and
acquiring properties that exist within highly regulated zoning regions and may be candidates for re-zoning. This is an essential
aspect of our overall growth strategy because we target uniquely zoned properties that are developed as candidates for specific
industry operators. Once the properties have been acquired and/or re-zoned, their value may be substantially higher as demand
for properties within the specific zoning region increases.  

We
manage a portfolio of properties that we own, lease, and provide direct development on each property we acquire. This can include
complete architectural design and subsequent build-outs, general support, landscaping, general up-keep, facilities management,
and state of the art security systems. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, improvements made to rental properties
amounted to $611,314.  

As
of September 30, 2016, a summary of rental properties owned by us consisted of the following:  

* Annual base rent represents amount of cash payments due
from tenants and differs from revenues to be recognized on our consolidated financial statements. 

**Does not include rental increase pursuant to amended lease dated October 5, 2016 and effective November
1, 2016.  

Recent
Developments   

During
2014, we entered into lease agreements with non-profit companies and other companies whose director is a beneficial stockholder
of the Company. Additionally, in August 2015, we entered into two lease agreements with C3C3 Group, LLC, a company owned by a
beneficial shareholder of the Company (the  Tenant ) to lease space in Tempe, Arizona and Chino Valley, Arizona. The
Tempe lease commenced on September 1, 2015, was amended on August 23, 2016 and expires on July 31, 2035 with base monthly rent
$13,500, subject to a 5% annual increase and increases in rental area up to 20,000 square feet. The Chino Valley lease commenced
on August 1, 2015, was amended on October 5, 2016 and expires on July 31, 2035 with base monthly rent $30,000, subject to a 5%
annual increase and increases in rental area up to 25,000 square feet. The parties identified a budget of $2,000,000 for developing
the property and constructing the Tenant improvements. Through September 30, 2016, capitalized building improvements and construction
in progress costs related to the China Valley and Tempe properties amounted to $611,314. As of September 30, 2016, the Town of
Chino Valley has granted the Company a five year Phased Protected Development Rights Plan for the Chino Valley Property with an
option to extend for an additional two year term.  

On
April 22, 2016, Zoned Colorado Properties, LLC ( Zoned Colorado ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, entered
into a Contract to Buy and Sell Real Estate (Commercial) (the  Agreement ) with Parachute Development Corporation
( Seller ) pursuant to which Zoned Colorado agreed to purchase, and Seller agreed to sell, property in Parachute,
Colorado (the  Property ) for a purchase price of $499,857. Of the total purchase price, $274,857, or 55%, will be
paid in cash at closing and $225,000, or 45%, will be financed by Seller at an interest rate of 6.5%, amortized over a five-year
period, with a balloon payment at the end of the fifth year. Payments will be made monthly and there will be no pre-payment penalty.
Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, the parties will cooperate in good faith to complete due diligence during a period of
45 days following execution of the Agreement. The closing is subject to certain contingencies, including that Zoned Colorado must
obtain acceptable financing for the purchase and development of the property, the grant of a special use permit by the Town of
Parachute, approval of a protected development deal or equivalent agreement by the Town of Parachute, execution of a lease agreement
by a prospective tenant and the prospective tenant s obtaining a license to cultivate on the property. Pursuant to the terms
of the Agreement, Zoned Colorado will have a right of first refusal on eleven additional lots owned by Seller in Parachute, Colorado.
In April 2016, we paid a refundable deposit of $45,000 into escrow in connection with the Agreement. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company and Seller are still cooperating to complete the purchase.  

Results
of Operations   

The
following comparative analysis of results of operations was based primarily on the comparative unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements, footnotes and related information for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with
the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, which are included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q.  

Comparison
of Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

Revenues    

For
the three and nine months ended nine September 30, 2016 and 2015, revenues consisted of the following:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, total revenues amounted to $481,211, including related party revenues of $422,382,
as compared to $408,078, including related party revenues of $286,914, for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $73,133 or 17.9%. This increase in revenues was attributable to an increase in rent revenues   related party of $135,468
or 47.2% due to the increase in space leased to related parties, offset by a decrease in third party rent revenues of $62,335
or 51.4% due to non-renewal of certain leases of third party tenants. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total revenues
amounted to $1,291,293, including related party revenues of $1,113,384, as compared to $923,065, including related party revenues
of $634,883, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $368,228 or 39.9%. This increase in revenues was attributable
to an increase in rent revenues   related party of $478,501 or 75.4% due to the increase in space leased to related parties,
offset by a decrease in third party rent revenues of $110,273 or 38.3% due to non-renewal of certain leases of third party tenants.  

Operating
expenses    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, operating expenses amounted to $350,756 as compared to $697,008 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $346,252 or 49.7%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, operating
expenses amounted to $1,454,762 as compared to $1,899,644 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease
of $444,882 or 23.4%.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, operating expenses consisted of the following:  

For
    the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, professional fees decreased by $247,917, or 67.0%, and $406,770, or 40.2%,
    as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September
    30, 2016, the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in legal fees of $5,388 and $59,986 attributable to a decrease
    in activities related to legacy legal issues and other legal matters, a decrease in consulting fees of $223,322 and $354,781
    related to a decrease in accretion of stock-based consulting expense from the granting of stock options to a consultant and
    a decrease in other consulting expense, and a decrease in other professional fees of $37,982 and $89,298, offset by an increase
    in public relations fees incurred of $18,775 and $97,295, respectively. We used consultants to assist us with introductions
    to potential business partners and customers, to help us with public relations services, including helping us find market
    makers, broker-dealers, and sources of capital, advise us on construction of indoor, outdoor and greenhouse agricultural systems,
    assist us with agricultural licensing and zoning, and assist with development of business modeling, market development and
    advice concerning equity and debt financings.   

General
    and administrative expenses consist of expenses such as rent expense, directors  and officers  liability insurance,
    travel expenses, office expenses, telephone and internet expenses and other general operating expenses. For the three and
    nine months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased by $21,730 or 31.3%, and $46,524 or 23.4%,
    as compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. These decreases were primarily attributable to a decrease
    in in these expenses due to cost cutting measures.   

For
    the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, depreciation and amortization expense increased by $7,541 and $15,850,
    respectively, as compared to the comparable respective periods in 2015, attributable to an increase in depreciable assets.   

Property
    operating expenses consist of property management fees, property insurance, repairs and maintenance fees, utilities and other
    expenses related to our rental properties. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, property operating expenses
    decreased by $40,955 or 63.1%, and $49,075 or 47.2%, respectively, as compared to the comparable respective periods in 2015.
    In the third quarter of 2015, we terminated the use of a management company and now we manage all of the properties.

    the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, real estate taxes (decreased) increased by $(7,597) or 26.4%, and $7,360
    or 13.0%, respectively, as compared to the comparable respective 2015 period. In August 2015, we acquired additional rental
    properties and began incurring such taxes.   

Income
(loss) from operations    

As
a result of the factors described above, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, our income from operations amounted to
$130,455 as compared to a loss from operations of $(288,930) for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase
of $419,385 or 145.2%. Additionally, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our loss from operations amounted to $163,469
as compared to $976,579 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $813,110 or 83.3%.  

Other
expenses    

Other
expenses include interest expense and other income. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total other expenses, net amounted
to $56,873 as compared to $57,829, representing a decrease of $956 or 1.7%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total
other expenses, net amounted to $172,462 as compared to $168,591, representing an increase of $3,871 or 2.3%.  

Net
income (loss)    

As
a result of the foregoing, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net income amounted to $73,582, or $0.00 per
common share, and a net loss of $346,759, or $(0.02) per common share, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, net loss amounted to $335,931, or $0.02 per common share, and $1,145,170, or $0.06 per common share, respectively.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity
is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for ongoing operations. We had cash of
$609,826 and $1,281,464 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Our
primary uses of cash have been for salaries and other compensation, fees paid for professional services such as legal fees, accounting
fees and other professional fees, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, and for the acquisition and
development of our rental properties. All funds received have been expended in the furtherance of growing the business. We have
received funds from the collection of rental income, and from various financing activities such as from the sale of our common
stock and from debt financings. The following trends are reasonably likely to result in changes in our liquidity over the near
to long term:  

An
    increase in working capital requirements to finance our current business,   

Acquisition
    and buildout of rental properties;   

Addition
    of administrative and sales personnel as the business grows, and   

The
    cost of being a public company.   

We
currently have material commitments for capital expenditures amounting to approximately $3,500,000 for the expansion and buildout
of our Chino Valley Property and the acquisition and development of our Parachute Project. These capital expenditures are contingent
upon several factors including: the Company obtaining financing for the development of the premises and the construction of the
tenant improvements in such amount and on such terms and provisions as are acceptable to the Company in our sole and absolute
discretion from a lender approved by us in our sole discretion. Accordingly, we can delay or cancel these planned capital expenditures,
if necessary. As of the date of this report, we have not obtained any financing and are using working capital for development
of our properties.  

We
may need to raise additional funds, particularly if we are unable to generate positive cash flow as a result of our operations.
We estimate that based on current plans and assumptions, that our available cash will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements
under our present operating expectations for the next 12 months. Other than revenue received from the lease of our rental properties,
funds received from the sale of our common stock and funds received from debt, we presently have no other significant alternative
source of working capital.  

We
have used these funds to fund our operating expenses, pay our obligations, acquire and develop rental properties, and grow our
company. We need to raise significant additional capital or debt financing to acquire new properties, to develop existing properties,
and to assure we have sufficient working capital for our ongoing operations and debt obligations.  

Our
future operation is dependent on our ability to manage our current cash balances and on the collection of rental revenues. We
intend on securing additional financing to acquire and develop additional and existing properties. Financing transactions may
include the issuance of equity or debt securities, obtaining credit facilities, or other financing mechanisms. Even if we are
able to raise the funds required, it is possible that we could incur unexpected costs and expenses or experience unexpected cash
requirements that would force us to seek alternative financing. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity or debt securities,
stockholders may experience additional dilution or the new equity securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior
to those of existing holders of our common stock. The inability to obtain additional capital may restrict our ability to grow
our business operations.  

Cash
Flow   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Net
cash flow used by operating activities was $118,290 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $455,472 for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease in cash used in operations of $337,182.  

Net
cash flow used in investing activities reflects the purchase and development of property and equipment, and rental properties
that primarily consists of buildings, improvements and construction in progress of $553,848 and $250,256 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Net
cash flows from financing activities was zero for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash provided by
financing activities $997,750 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 which consisted of the sale of common stock of $1,000,000
offset by the redemption of common stock of $2,250.  

Contractual
Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

Contractual
Obligations    

We
have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs,
cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates.
We cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments. We have presented below a summary of the most significant
assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables, in order to assist in the review of this information
within the context of our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The following tables summarize
our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands), and the effect these obligations are expected to
have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods.  

Off-balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
have not entered into any other financial guarantees or other commitments to guarantee the payment obligations of any third parties.
We have not entered into any derivative contracts that are indexed to our shares and classified as shareholders  equity
or that are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, we do not have any retained or contingent interest
in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serves as credit, liquidity or market risk support to such entity. We do
not have any variable interest in any unconsolidated entity that provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit support
to us or engages in leasing, hedging or research and development services with us.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited and unaudited consolidated
financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.
The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually
evaluate our estimates, including those related to income taxes, and the valuation of equity transactions. We base our estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results
of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. Any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts
of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.
We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation
of the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  

Rental
Properties   

Rental
properties are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Betterments, major renovations and certain costs
directly related to the improvement of rental properties are capitalized. Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 7
to 39 years. Tenant improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lives of the related leases, which approximate
the useful lives of the assets.  

Upon
the acquisition of real estate, we assess the fair value of acquired assets (including land, buildings and improvements, identified
intangibles, such as acquired above-market leases and acquired in-place leases) and acquired liabilities (such as acquired below-market
leases) and allocate the purchase price based on these assessments. The Company assesses fair value based on estimated cash flow
projections that utilize appropriate discount and capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash
flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known trends, and market/economic conditions. We
record acquired intangible assets (including acquired above-market leases and acquired in-place leases) and acquired intangible
liabilities (including below-market leases) at their estimated fair value. We amortize acquired above-and below-market leases
as a decrease or increase to rental income, respectively, over the lives of the respective leases. Amortization of acquired in-place
leases is included as a component of depreciation and amortization.  

Our
properties, including any related intangible assets, are individually reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over the anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis. An impairment
loss is measured based on the excess of the property s carrying amount over its estimated fair value. Impairment analyses
are based on our current plans, intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared.
If our estimates of the projected future cash flows, anticipated holding periods, or market conditions change, our evaluation
of impairment losses may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The evaluation
of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based, in part, on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital
requirements that could differ materially from actual results. Plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood
of recording impairment losses.  

We
have capitalized land, which is not subject to depreciation.  

Revenue
recognition   

Rental
income includes base rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its respective lease and is reported on a straight-line
basis over the non-cancellable term of the lease, which includes the effects of rent steps and rent abatements under the leases.
We commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space or controls the physical use of the
leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use. Rental income also includes the amortization of
acquired above-and below-market leases, net. Beginning in 2014, we began generating revenues from the non-residential rental properties.  

Certain
of our leases currently contain rental increases at specified intervals. We record as an asset, and include in revenue, rents
receivable that will be received if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of
the lease. Deferred rents receivable in the accompanying balance sheets includes the cumulative difference between rental revenue
recorded on a straight-line basis and rents received from the tenants in accordance with the lease terms. Accordingly, management
determines to what extent the deferred rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible. We review material rents
receivable and takes into consideration the tenant s payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions
in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event
that the collectability of rent receivable with respect to any given tenant is in doubt, we record an increase in the allowance
for uncollectible accounts or we record a direct write-off of the specific rent receivable. For the nine months ended September
30, 2015, in connection with certain related party leases, we only included in revenues the amount of rents received from the
related parties in accordance with the lease terms since on August 1, 2015, we transferred title to our Bernalillo, New Mexico
and the respective related party lease as part of a settlement agreement.  

Stock-based
compensation   

Stock-based
compensation is accounted for based on the requirements of the Share-Based Payment Topic of ASC 718 which requires recognition
in the financial statements of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments
over the period the employee or director is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively, the vesting
period). The ASC also requires measurement of the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award based
on the grant-date fair value of the award.  

Pursuant
to ASC Topic 505-50, for share-based payments to consultants and other third-parties, compensation expense is determined at the
 measurement date.  The expense is recognized over the service period of the award. Until the measurement date is
reached, the total amount of compensation expense remains uncertain. We initially record compensation expense based on the fair
value of the award at the reporting date.

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

We
maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as that term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e), promulgated by the SEC pursuant
to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Disclosure controls and procedures include
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our company s reports filed under
the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management, with the participation
of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated our company s disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.  

The
ineffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures was due to the following material weaknesses identified in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting: (1) the lack of multiples levels of management review on complex accounting, financial
reporting, and business issues, (2) a lack of adequate segregation of duties, (3) a lack of approvals on material real estate
acquisitions and disbursements, and (4) we do not have an independent audit committee. Until such time as we expand our staff
to include additional personnel, it is likely we will continue to report material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting.  

Changes
in Internal Control   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.       

PART
II. OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings   

Healing
Healthcare 3, Inc.; Xingang, LLC v. v. Zoned Properties, Inc., et al.; Court Filed: Maricopa County Superior Court, Arizona; Case
Number: CV2015-012264; Date Filed: October 21, 2015.   

On
October 21, 2015, Healing Healthcare 3, Inc. ( HH3 ) and Xingang, LLC filed a complaint against the Company, President
and CEO Bryan McLaren, Board member Alex McLaren, and wholly-owned subsidiary Tempe Industrial Properties, LLC, among others.
The complaint concerned the Company s lease of space in Tempe, Arizona to operate a medical marijuana cultivation site.
HH3 and Xingang claim that the Company and its related parties violated the terms of the lease for various reasons. On May 23,
2014, the Company concluded that the lease had been breached, and terminated the lease and retook possession of the property.
Plaintiffs asserted various contract and tort claims against the Company and its related parties, and seeks $10,000 per day  for
each day that the Company remained in possession of the Tempe Property in violation of the Lease,  attorneys  fees
and costs, treble damages, punitive damages, and interest. The complaint was served on the Company and its related parties on
February 17, 2016. On March 8, 2016, the Company, Bryan McLaren, Alex McLaren, and TIP (the  Moving Parties ) filed
a motion to dismiss the claims asserted against them in the complaint, with prejudice, on various grounds. On April 14, 2016,
the court granted in part, and denied in part, the motion to dismiss. In sum, the court granted the dismissal of the contract
claims against the McLarens without leave to amend; denied the dismissal of the two contract claims against the Company and TIP;
and granted the dismissal of the remaining tort claims, subject to leave to amend the complaint within 20 days of the order. On
May 5, 2016 HH3 and Xingang filed an amended complaint with new fact allegations, reasserting the claims that had survived the
motion to dismiss. A motion to dismiss the amended complaint was filed on behalf of the Company, Bryan McLaren, and TIP. The motion
was fully-briefed, and by order dated July 8, 2016, the Court granted the motion to dismiss the claims asserted by Xingang but
denied the rest of the motion. The Company, Bryan McLaren, and TIP filed their answer to the amended complaint on July 27, 2016.
On or about November 8, 2016, the Company reached a settlement with Healing Healthcare 3, Inc. ( HH3 ) to settle the
lawsuit HH3 filed on October 21, 2015.  The terms of the settlement are confidential, but the lawsuit will be dismissed in
its entirety with prejudice.  

In
a letter dated April 4, 2016, a shareholder of the Company, through legal counsel, made a demand on the Company related to a certain
reverse-stock split that occurred following changes in the composition of the Company s officers and directors in 2014.
In its letter, the shareholder alleged, among other things, that: the reverse-stock split was designed to dilute existing Company
interests of existing shareholders and to further entrench new management s control over the Company. This shareholder demanded
that the board of directors bring a legal action against certain officers and directors and against the Company s transfer
agent for various alleged violations of federal and state law. This shareholder indicated its intent to file a putative shareholder
derivative action if its demand were not accepted. The Company evaluated this shareholder s demand and engaged in settlement
talks for several weeks. On July 15, 2016, the parties entered into a Confidential Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the
 Settlement Agreement ), whereby the Company will issue an aggregate of 50,000 shares of its common stock as follows:
(a) 12,500 shares were issued within three days from execution of the Settlement Agreement, (b) 12,500 shall be issued on September
30, 2016, (c) 12,500 shares shall be issued on December 30, 2016, and (d) 12,500 shares shall be issued on March 31, 2017.  

In
a letter dated May 10, 2016, Marc Brannigan, the Company s former CEO, and related parties (collectively,  Brannigan )
sent a demand letter, through counsel, to the Company and certain other third-parties, claiming, among other things, that the
Company improperly diluted Brannigan s equity in the Company. Brannigan demands that the Company issue shares to  reverse 
the dilution, invalidate shares improperly issued by the Company, pay unspecified damages, recover one-third of all Company shares
owned by Alan Abrams and Chris Carra, and recover Brannigan s purported majority ownership and voting control of the Company.
The Company has evaluated Brannigan s purported claims, and intends to vigorously defend against such claim. A mediation
involving all interested parties occurred on July 29, 2016 and was unsuccessful.
