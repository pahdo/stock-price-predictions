1.    Organization and Basis of Presentation 

Sunshine Financial, Inc. ("Sunshine Financial" or the "Holding Company"), a Maryland corporation, is the holding company for Sunshine Community Bank (the "Bank") and owns all the outstanding common stock of the Bank.

Sunshine Community Bank and its holding company, Sunshine Financial, Inc. announced July 11, 2016 that the Bank completed its conversion from a federal savings bank charter to a Florida state bank charter effective July 1, 2016.  As a result of the charter conversion, the Bank's legal name changed to Sunshine Community Bank.

The changes had no effect on bank products or services, and deposits remain insured through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  As a Florida-chartered financial institution, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation is the primary regulator for the Bank.  Sunshine Community Bank is also regulated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Sunshine Financial, Inc. continues to be regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve").

The Holding Company's only business is the operation of the Bank.   The Bank, through its six banking offices,  provides a variety of retail community banking services to individuals and businesses primarily in Leon County, Florida. The Bank's deposits are insured up to the applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank's subsidiary is Sunshine Member Insurance Services, Inc. which was established to sell automobile warranty, credit life and disability insurance products associated with loan products. Collectively the entities are referred to as the "Company."

These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 8-03 of Regulation S-X and do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for a complete presentation of the Company's consolidated financial condition and results of operations. It is recommended that these unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on March 29, 2016.

In the opinion of management, the information reflects all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which are necessary in order to make the financial statements not misleading and for a fair representation of the results of operations for such periods.  The results for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 should not be considered as indicative of results for a full year, or any other future period.

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with GAAP, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements.  Actual results could differ from these estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to change in the near term are determining the allowance for loan losses, accounting for deferred income taxes as well as the valuation of foreclosed real estate.

2.    RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities,  which is intended to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information.  The ASU requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair values recognized in net earnings, simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment and eliminates the requirement to disclose fair values, the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost.  The ASU also clarifies that the Company should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale debt securities in combination with the Company's other deferred tax assets.  These amendments are effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017.  The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-2,  Leases (Topic 842)  which will require lessees to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases with term of more than twelve months. Consistent with current GAAP, the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease.  The new ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized on the balance sheet.  The ASU also will require disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements, providing additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.  The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the ASU on its consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations.  Early application will be permitted for all organizations.

In March 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments. The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  Early adoption is permitted for any organization in any interim or annual period. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016.  The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the ASU on its consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statements of operations.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS (continued) 

In June 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326).  The ASU improves financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by the Company. The ASU requires the Company to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. The Company will continue to use judgment to determine which loss estimation method is appropriate for their circumstances. The ASU requires enhanced disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating credit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting standards of an organization's portfolio. These disclosures include qualitative and quantitative requirements that provide additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. Additionally, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The ASU will take effect for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early application will be permitted for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is in the process of determining the effect of the ASU on its consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations.

In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  This ASU addresses the appropriate classification of eight specific cash flow issues on the cash flow statement. Debt prepayment costs should be classified as an outflow for financing activities. Settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments divides the interest portion as an outflow for operating activities and the principal portion as an outflow for financing activities. Contingent consideration payments made after a business combination should be classified as outflows for financing and operating activities. Proceeds from the settlement of bank-owned life insurance policies should be classified as inflows from investing activities. Other specific areas are identified in the ASU as to the appropriate classification of the cash inflows or outflows.  The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted and must be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

3.   Earnings (Loss)   Per Share 

Earnings (loss) per share ("EPS") has been computed on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. For the three-months ended September 30, 2016, the outstanding stock options are considered dilutive securities for purposes of calculating diluted EPS which was computed using the treasury stock method.   For the three-months ended September 30, 2015 and the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, the outstanding stock options were not considered dilutive securities due to the net loss incurred by the Company.  The shares purchased by the ESOP are included in the weighted-average shares when they are committed to be released ($ in thousands, except per share amounts):

There were no securities pledged at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.

At September 30, 2016 the unrealized losses on eight securities were considered by management to be attributable to changes in market interest rates, and not to credit risk on the part of the issuer. Accordingly, if market interest rates were to decline, much or the entire decline in market value would likely be recovered through market appreciation. As management has the ability and intent to hold debt securities until maturity, or for the foreseeable future, no declines in the fair value below amortized cost are deemed to be other than temporary.

5.   Loans, Continued 

The Company has divided the loan portfolio into three portfolio segments and eight classes, each with different risk characteristics and methodologies for assessing risk. The portfolio segments identified by the Company are as follows:

Real Estate Mortgage Loans.   Real estate mortgage loans are loans comprised of three classes: One- to four-family, Commercial real estate and Construction and lot loans. The Company generally originates one- to four-family mortgage loans in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of a mortgaged property, but will also permit loan-to-value ratios of up to 95%. For one- to four-family loans exceeding an 80% loan-to-value ratio, the Company generally requires the borrower to obtain private mortgage insurance covering any loss on the amount of the loan in excess of 80% in the event of foreclosure. Commercial real estate loans are generally originated at 75% or less loan-to-value ratio and have amortization terms of up to 20 years and maturities of up to ten years.  Construction loans to borrowers are to finance the construction of one- to four-family, owner occupied properties. These loans are categorized as construction loans during the construction period, later converting to residential real estate loans after the construction is complete and amortization of the loan begins. Real estate construction loan funds are disbursed periodically based on the percentage of construction completed.  If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, the Company may be compelled to advance additional funds to complete the construction with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower to repay the loan.  The Company carefully monitors these loans with on-site inspections and requires the receipt of lien waivers on funds advanced. Construction loans are typically secured by the properties under construction. The Company also makes loans for the purchase of developed lots for future construction of the borrower's primary residence.  The Company will generally originate lot loans in an amount up to 75% of the lower of the purchase price or appraisal and have a maximum amortization of up to 20 years and maturities up to 20 years. Construction and lot loan lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term permanent financing of residential properties.

Commercial Loans.   Commercial loans are comprised of non-real estate secured and unsecured loans.  The Company offers these commercial loans generally to its commercial real estate borrowers.

Consumer Loans.   Consumer loans are comprised of four classes: Home Equity, Automobile, Credit cards and unsecured, and Other.  The Company offers a variety of secured consumer loans, including home equity, new and used automobile, boat and other recreational vehicle loans, and loans secured by deposit accounts.  The Company also offers unsecured consumer loans including a credit card product.  The Company originates its consumer loans primarily in its market area.  Repayment of these loans is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas such as unemployment levels. Loans to consumers are extended after a credit evaluation, including the creditworthiness of the borrower(s), the purpose of the credit, and the secondary source of repayment. Consumer loans are made at fixed and variable interest rates and may be made on terms of up to twenty years. Risk is mitigated by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.

The following summarizes the loan credit quality by loan grade and class at the dates indicated (in thousands):

Internally assigned loan grades are defined as follows:

Pass    A Pass loan's primary source of loan repayment is satisfactory, with secondary sources very likely to be realized if necessary.

Special Mention    A Special Mention loan has potential weaknesses that deserve management's close attention.  If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or the   Company's credit position at some future date.  Special Mention loans are not adversely classified and do not expose an institution to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification.

Substandard    A Substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the   Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.

Doubtful    A loan classified Doubtful has all the weaknesses inherent in one classified Substandard with the added characteristics that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

Loss    A loan classified Loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted.  This classification does not mean that the asset has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off this basically worthless asset even though partial recovery may be affected in the future.

The Company had no troubled debt restructurings (TDR) entered into during the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. The Company had no commitments to extend additional credit to borrowers whose terms have been modified in TDRs.

6.    Lines of Credit 

The Company has an unsecured federal funds line of credit for $6.0 million with a correspondent bank and a $41.8 million line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta collateralized by a blanket lien on qualifying loans. At September 30, 2016, the Company had $5.5 million outstanding in FHLB advances that mature in 2016 at a weighted average fixed rate of 0.40%.  At December 31, 2015, the Company had $5.0 million outstanding in FHLB advances that matured in 2016 at a weighted average fixed rate of 0.39%.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no outstanding balances on the federal funds line of credit.

7.    Off-Balance-Sheet Financial Instruments 

The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments are unused lines of credit and commitments to extend credit and may involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheets.  The contract amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement the Company has in these financial instruments.

The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for unused lines of credit and commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for on-balance-sheet instruments.

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract.  Commitments generally have fixed-expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Company evaluates each customer's credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis.  The amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the Company upon extension of credit is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty.

Unused lines of credit and commitments to extend credit typically result in loans with a market interest rate when funded.  A summary of the amounts of the Company's financial instruments, with off-balance-sheet risk follows at September 30, 2016 (in thousands):

Discussion regarding the assumptions used to compute the estimated fair values of financial instruments can be found in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K.

9.   Employee Stock Ownership Plan 

The Holding Company has established an ESOP which acquired 98,756 shares of common stock in exchange for a $988,000 note payable from the Bank to the Holding Company.  The note bears interest at a fixed rate of 4.25%, is payable in annual installments and is due in 2021.  The ESOP expense was $1,000 for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and $4,000 for the three-months ended September 30, 2015.  The ESOP expense was $5,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and $11,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.  At September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were 44,539 and 54,412 shares, respectively, that had not been allocated under the ESOP.

10.   Equity Incentive Plan 

In 2012, the stockholders approved the Company's 2012 Equity Incentive Plan ("Plan"). The Plan authorizes the grant of options for up to 123,445 shares of the Holding Company's common stock. The options granted have ten year terms and vest from one to five years.  A summary of the activity in the Company's stock options is as follows:

At September 30, 2016, there was approximately $63,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock options granted under the Plan.

The Plan also authorized the grant of up to 49,378 restricted common shares.  The restricted shares awarded vest equally over five years from the date of grant. Restricted shares are forfeited if employment is terminated before the restriction period expires.  The record holder of the Company's restricted shares of common stock possesses all the rights of a holder of the Company common stock, including the right to receive dividends on and to vote the restricted shares. The restricted shares may not be sold, transferred, pledged, assigned, encumbered, or otherwise alienated or hypothecated until they become fully vested and transferable in accordance with the agreements. Compensation expense for restricted stock totaled $39,000 for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Compensation expense for restricted stock totaled $118,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and $116,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. The income tax benefit recognized was $15,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and $45,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

A summary of the status of the Company's restricted stock and changes during the periods then ended are presented below:

Total unrecognized compensation cost related to these non-vested restricted stock amounted to approximately $340,000 at September 30, 2016.  This cost is expected to be recognized monthly over the related vesting period using the straight-line method through 2019.

12.   Regulatory Matters 

On September 30, 2016, the Bank was subject to minimum capital requirements imposed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital.

At September 30, 2016, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements. Consistent with its goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, the Bank's policy is to maintain a "well-capitalized" status under the capital categories. Based on capital levels at September 30, 2016, the Bank was considered to be well-capitalized.

The Bank's actual regulatory capital amounts and percentages are presented in the table ($ in thousands).

In addition to the minimum Common Equity Tier 1 ("CET-1"), Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios, the Bank has to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET-1 capital equal above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained earnings that could be utilized for such actions. This new capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in starting in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year to an amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets when fully implemented in January 2019.

For a bank holding company with less than $1.0 billion in assets, the capital guidelines apply on a bank only basis and the Federal Reserve expects the holding company's subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations.  If the Company was subject to regulatory guidelines for bank holding companies with $1.0 billion or more in assets, at September 30, 2016 the Company would have exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.

General

Sunshine Financial is the holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Sunshine Community Bank. Sunshine Community Bank was originally chartered as a credit union in 1952 as Sunshine State Credit Union to serve state government employees in the metropolitan Tallahassee area.  On July 1, 2007, we converted from a state-chartered credit union known as Sunshine State Credit Union to a federal mutual savings bank known as Sunshine Savings Bank, and in 2009 reorganized into the non-stock mutual holding company structure.  On April 5, 2011, Sunshine Financial completed a public offering as part of Sunshine Savings Bank's conversion and reorganization from a non-stock mutual holding company to a stock holding company structure.  Sunshine Community Bank and its holding company, Sunshine Financial, Inc. announced July 11, 2016 that the bank completed its conversion from a federal savings bank charter to a Florida state bank charter effective July 1, 2016.  As a result of the charter conversion, the Bank's legal name changed to Sunshine Community Bank.  References to we, us and our throughout this document refer to Sunshine Financial and Sunshine Community Bank, as the context requires.

As a Florida-chartered financial institution, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation will be the primary regulator for the Bank.  Sunshine Financial, Inc. continues to be regulated by the Federal Reserve.  These changes had no effect on bank products or services, and deposits remain insured through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

We currently operate out of six full-service branch offices serving the Tallahassee, Florida metropolitan area.   Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those funds in loans secured by first and second mortgages on one- to four-family residences (including residential construction loans), commercial real estate, commercial business loans, home equity loans and lines of credit, lot loans, and direct automobile, credit card and other consumer loans.

We offer a variety of deposit accounts, which are our primary source of funding for our lending activities.  Our operations are significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions as well as government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs, housing and financial institutions.  Deposit flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing time deposits, other investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings.  Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles.  Sources of funds for lending activities include primarily deposits, borrowings, payments on loans and income provided from operations.

Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income. A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services. Our noninterest expense has typically exceeded our net interest income and we have relied primarily upon noninterest income to supplement our net interest income and to achieve earnings.

General (continued)

Our operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, general and administrative, occupancy and equipment, data processing services, professional services and marketing expenses. Salaries and benefits consist primarily of the salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for retirement and other employee benefits. Occupancy and equipment expenses, which are the fixed and variable costs of building and equipment, consist primarily of lease payments, taxes, depreciation, amortization expense, maintenance and costs of utilities.

Critical Accounting Policies

The Company has identified several accounting policies that as a result of judgments, estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies, are critical to an understanding of the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in the Company's 2015 Form 10-K under Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation   Critical Accounting Policies." That discussion highlights estimates the Company makes that involve uncertainty or potential for substantial change. There have been no material changes in the Company's critical accounting policies and estimates as previously disclosed in the Company's 2015 Form 10-K.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015

General.   Total assets increased $9.5 million, or 6.0%, to $167.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $157.8 million at December 31, 2015 primarily funded by a $8.1 million increase in deposits, a $500,000 increase in Federal Home Loan Bank advances and a $3.4 million decrease in securities held to maturity. The composition of total assets changed during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 reflecting a $2.9 million increase in cash and cash equivalents and a $10.0 million increase in net loans.

Loans.   Our net loan portfolio increased $10.0 million, to $123.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $113.4 million at December 31, 2015.  The increase in loans was due to a $10.1 million increase in total real estate loans and a $603,000 increase in commercial loans, partially offset by decreases in all categories of consumer loans.

Allowance for Loan Losses.   Our allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 was $892,000, or 0.72% of loans, compared to $895,000, or 0.79% of loans, at December 31, 2015.  Nonperforming loans declined to $1.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $1.8 million December 31, 2015.  Nonperforming loans to total loans decreased to 1.37% at September 30, 2016 from 1.54% at December 31, 2015 as a result of both the decline in nonperforming loans and the increase in our loan portfolio.

Deposits.   Total deposits increased $8.1million, or 6.2%, to $138.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $130.5 million at December 31, 2015.  This increase was primarily due to increases in noninterest bearing deposits, money-market deposit accounts and savings accounts, partially offset by decreases in time deposits.

Equity.   Total stockholders' equity increased $118,000 to $21.5 million at September 30, 2016.  This increase was primarily due to stock-based compensation of $157,000, partially offset by a net loss of $50,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

General.  Net earnings for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $35,000 compared to a net loss of $121,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in an annualized return on average assets of 0.09% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and (0.32)% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in net earnings was due primarily to increases in our net interest income and noninterest income, and a decrease in our noninterest expense.

Net Interest Income.   Net interest income increased $94,000, or 6.8%, and was $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $101,000 increase in interest income, partially offset by a $7,000 increase in interest expense.  The increase in interest income resulted from an increase in average loans outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by a decrease in our average yield on interest-earning assets.  Average loans outstanding were $120.9 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $105.7 million at September 30, 2015.  Our net interest rate spread decreased to 3.97% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.04% for the same period in 2015, while our net interest margin decreased to 4.06% from 4.13% for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 1.31x, from 1.32x for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Interest Income.  Interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $101,000, or 6.8%, to $1.6 million compared to the three month period ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a $15.2 million increase in average loans outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended 2015, partially offset by a 25 basis point decrease in our average yield on loans during the same period.  Average loans outstanding increased to $120.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $105.7 million for the same period in 2015.  The average rate on loans receivable decreased to 4.94% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 5.19% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Interest Expense.  Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $7,000, or 7.9% to $101,000 from $94,000 for the same period ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the cost of $5.5 million in average outstanding FHLB advances compared to none during the same period in 2015.  The total cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 0.36% compared to 0.37% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.

Provision for Loan Losses.   We recorded a provision for loan losses of $45,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The provision for loan losses reflected historical and incurred loan losses, the increase in the size of our loan portfolio as well as the change in the mix of loans. Net charge-offs for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $78,000 compared to net charge-offs of $43,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Nonperforming loans to total loans at September 30, 2016 were 1.37% compared to 1.54% at December 31, 2015.  The allowance for loan losses to loans was 0.72% at September 30, 2016 compared to 0.79% at December 31, 2015.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Continued

Management considers the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 to be adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio based on the assessment of the above-mentioned factors affecting the loan portfolio. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future losses will not exceed the amount of the established allowance for loan losses or that any increased allowance for loan losses that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in additions to our provision for loan losses based upon their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination.

Noninterest Income.  Noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $46,000, or 10.5%, to $486,000 compared to $440,000 for the same period in 2015.  Noninterest income increased primarily due to a $25,000 increase in other income, a $15,000 increase in the fees and charges on loans, and a $14,000 increase in the gain on sale of foreclosed assets, partially offset by a $12,000 decrease in fees and service charges on deposit.  The increase in other income was due to the sale of stock invested in a credit union service organization.

Noninterest Expense.  Noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $150,000, or 7.4%, as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a reduction in salaries and employee benefits expenses.  The decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense was primarily due to a reduction of six full time equivalent employees over the last year.

Income Taxes.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded income taxes of $16,000 on a before tax earnings of $51,000.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit of $118,000 on a before tax loss of $239,000.  Our effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 31.4% compared to (49.4)% for the same time period in 2015.

Comparison of the Nine-Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015

General.  Net loss for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 was $50,000 compared to a net loss of $68,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in an annualized return on average assets of (0.04)% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and (0.06)% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in net earnings was due to an increase in net interest income and a decrease in noninterest expense, offset by a decrease in our noninterest income.

Net Interest Income.   Net interest income increased $235,000, or 5.6%, and was $4.4 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.2 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to a $247,000 increase in interest income, partially offset by a $12,000 increase in interest expense.  The increase in interest income resulted from an increase in average loans outstanding during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by a decrease in our average yield on loans.  Our average yield on interest-earning assets remained relatively the same at 4.36% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 4.37% for the same period in 2015.  The ratio of average interest-earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 1.31x, from 1.34x for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.

Interest Income.  Interest income for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 increased $247,000, or 5.5%, to $4.7 million compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in interest income for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to a $12.8 million increase in average loans outstanding during the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, partially offset by a 22 basis point decrease in our average yield on loans during the same period.  Average loans outstanding increased to $117.1 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, from $104.3 million for the same period in 2015.  The average rate on loans receivable decreased to 5.00% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 5.22% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.

Interest Expense.  Interest expense for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $293,000 from $281,000 for the same period ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in interest expense for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the cost of $4.7 million in average outstanding FHLB advances compared to none during the same period in 2015.  The total cost of interest-bearing liabilities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 was 0.36% compared to 0.37% for September 30, 2015.

Provision for Loan Losses.   We recorded a provision for loan losses of $135,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $125,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.  The provision for loan losses reflected historical and incurred loan losses, the increase in the size of our loan portfolio as well as the change in the mix of loans. Net charge-offs for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 were $138,000 compared to net charge-offs of $302,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.

Comparison of the Nine-Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, Continued 

Noninterest Income.  Noninterest income for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $488,000, or 26.0%, to $1.4 million compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of a $451,000 decrease in gain on the sale of land due to the one-time sale of land next to the home office in 2015. In addition, noninterest income decreased due to a $89,000 decrease in the gain on loan sales and a $26,000 decrease in fees and service charges on deposit accounts, partially offset by a $23,000 increase in income from bank owned life insurance and a $56,000 increase in other income.  The decrease in the gain on loan sales was due to management's and the Board's decision to retain most mortgage loans in portfolio in order to increase interest income in the long-term, which also has the effect of reducing short-term fee income and contributed to the decline in our average yield on loans.  Management intends to continually review this strategy's effect on the Bank's interest-rate risk and recommend corrective action if deemed necessary.  Income from bank owned life insurance, which insurance was purchased in April 2015, increased due to receipt of income for the entire nine-months ended September 30, 2016 compared to only a portion of the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in other income was due to the sale of stock invested in a credit union service organization.

Noninterest Expense.  Noninterest expense for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $319,000, or 5.3%, as compared to the same period in 2015.  The largest decreases were in salaries and employee benefits, data processing services, occupancy and equipment, and other noninterest expense offset slightly by increases in professional fees and credit card expense.  The decrease in salaries and employee benefits was primarily due to a reduction of six full time equivalent employees over the last year.  The increase in professional fees was due to higher legal fees for Sunshine Community Bank related to regulatory filings associated with the recent charter change to a Florida-chartered commercial bank.

Income Taxes.  For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $8,000 on a before tax loss of $58,000.  For the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded an income tax benefit of $46,000 on a before tax loss of $114,000.  Our effective tax benefit rate for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 was 13.8% compared to an effective tax benefit rate of 40.3% for the same time period in 2015.

Liquidity

Liquidity describes our ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business.  Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of our customers and to fund current and planned expenditures.  Our primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and securities, FHLB advances, and proceeds from maturities and calls of securities.  The Company has an unsecured federal funds line of credit for $6.0 million with a correspondent bank and a $41.8 million line with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta collateralized by a blanket lien on qualifying loans. At September 30, 2016 the Company had $5.5 million outstanding in FHLB advances that mature in 2016 at a weighted average fixed rate of 0.40%.

While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. Our most liquid assets are cash and short-term investments including interest-bearing demand deposits. The levels of these assets are dependent on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period.

Our cash flows are comprised of three primary classifications: cash flows from operating activities, investing activities, and financing activities.  For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.4 million.    Net cash used by investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations and the purchase of securities, offset by principal collections on loans and proceeds from pay-downs on securities, totaled $7.1 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016.    Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting primarily of the activity in FHLB advances and deposit accounts, was $8.7 million for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016.

The Holding Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity.  In addition to its operating expenses, the Holding Company is responsible for repurchasing shares pursuant to any Board approved stock repurchase program and paying any dividends, when and if declared by the Board, to its shareholders.  The Company has the ability to receive dividends or capital distributions from the Bank, although there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends.  At September 30, 2016, the Holding Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of $373,000.

We are committed to maintaining a strong liquidity position.  We monitor our liquidity position on a daily basis.  We anticipate that we will have sufficient funds to meet our current funding commitments.  Based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy, we anticipate that a significant portion of maturing time deposits will be retained.

Off-Balance Sheet Activities

In the normal course of operations, we engage in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in our financial statements.  These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks.  These transactions are used primarily to manage customers' requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit.  For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions likely to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Off-Balance Sheet Activities, Continued

A summary of our off-balance sheet commitments at September 30, 2016, is as follows (in thousands):

Capital Resources

On July 1, 2016, the Bank converted to a State of Florida commercial bank, and is now subject to the same regulatory minimum capital requirements as when it was regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. At September 30, 2016, the Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.

Consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy is for Sunshine Savings Bank to maintain a "well-capitalized" status under the capital categories of the Bank regulations.  At September 30, 2016, Sunshine Community Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements to be categorized as well capitalized under applicable regulatory guidelines with a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio of 15.22% of risk-weighted assets, which is above the required level of 6.5%, a Tier 1 leverage capital level of 11.76% of adjusted total assets, which is above the required level of 5.00%, Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets of 15.22%, which is above the required level of 8.00% and total risk-based capital   to risk-weighted assets of 15.96%, which is above the required level of 10.00%.

Management is not aware of any conditions or events since the most recent notification that would change our category. For additional information see Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item1, Part 1 of this Form 10-Q.

At September 30, 2016, stockholders' equity at Sunshine Community Bank totaled $20.9 million. Management monitors the capital levels of Sunshine Community Bank to provide for current and future business opportunities and to meet regulatory guidelines for "well-capitalized" institutions.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk

The Company provided information about market risk in Item 7A of its 2015 Form 10-K.  There have been no material changes in our market risk since our 2015 Form 10-K.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures

(a)   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

An evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Act")) as of September 30, 2016, was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer   and several other members of the Company's senior management.    Based on this evaluation, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures in effect as of September 30, 2016, were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Act is: (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms.

The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls may be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by override of the control. The design of any control procedure also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in  achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

(b) 
 
 Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
