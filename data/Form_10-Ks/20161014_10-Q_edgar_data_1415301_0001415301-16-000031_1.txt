BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

As of   September 6, 2016  , Del Frisco s Restaurant Group, Inc. (the  Company ) owned and operated   50   restaurants under the concept names of Del Frisco s Double Eagle Steak House ( Del Frisco s ), Sullivan s Steakhouse ( Sullivan s ), and Del Frisco s Grille ( Grille ). Of the   50   restaurants the Company operated at the end of the period covered by this report, there were   11   Del Frisco s restaurants,   1  8   Sullivan s restaurants and   21   Grille restaurants in operation in   23   states   and the District of Columbia  . 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Operating results for the   36     weeks ended   September 6, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for t  he fiscal year ending   December 27, 2016  . In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 29, 2015   filed with the SEC on   March 3, 2016   (the  201  5   10-K )  . 

The Company operates on a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending the last Tuesday in December. The fiscal quarters ended   September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015   each contained 12 weeks and are referred to herein as the   third   quarter of fi  scal year   2016   and the   third   quarter of fiscal year   2015  , respectively. Fiscal year   2016   will be a 52-week fiscal year a  s was fiscal year   2015  . 

Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses   during the reporting period  s  . The Company   base  s     its   estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at the time. Actual amounts may differ from those estimates. 

There have been no material changes to the significant accounting policies from wha  t was previously reported in the     2015   10-K. 

Reclassifications 

Certain amounts from the prior year have been reclassified to conform with the   current year   presentation. 

Intangible Assets 

On   March 17  , 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to   obtain and clarify ownership of all naming rights for Del Frisco s in certain counties of Kentucky, Indiana and Ohio   for aggregate   consideration   of     $600,000  .    Under the terms of the agreement, the Company made a payment of   $400,000   in April 2016   and   a payment of   $100,000   in August 2016  , with the remaining   $1  00,000   to be paid o  n   August 1, 2017  . This intangible asset has been recorded as a trade name with an indefinite life. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (     FASB     ) issued Accounting Standards Update (     ASU     ) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ,   which will supersede Accounting Standards Codification (     ASC     ) Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. In August 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of this new standard by one year. A core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should measure revenue in connection with its sale of goods and services to a customer based on an amount that depicts the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for each of those goods and services. For a contract that involves more than one performance obligation, the entity must (a) determine or, if necessary, estimate the standalone selling price at inception of the contract for the distinct goods or services underlying each performance obligation and (b) allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on the basis of the relative standalone selling prices. In addition, under the new guidance, an entity should recognize revenue when (or as) it satisfies each performance obligation under the contract by transferring the promised good or service to the customer. A good or service is deemed transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. The new standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. For public companies, this amendment is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early application is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 16, 2016.   The Company is   still   assessing the potential impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements  , but does not expect the impact of adopting this ASU to be material to the Company s financial statements and related disclosures  . 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which is intended to   limit   the alternative methods available for valuing inventory. The new guidance does not apply to inventory currently measured using the last-in-first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory valuation methods. Under the new standard, inventory valued using other methods, including the  

7   

Table of Contents  

first-in-first-out (FIFO) method, must be valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the impact of adopting this ASU to be material to the Company s financial statements and related disclosures.  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).   This   ASU is intended to improve the reporting of leasing transactions to provide users of financial statements with more decision-useful information.   This   ASU will require organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases.   The amendments in this update are   effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted.   A modified retrospective approach is required for all leases existing or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the consolidated financial statements.   The Company is still assessing the potential impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements, but does expect the impact of adopting this ASU to be material to the Company s financial statements and related disclosures  . 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Principal versus Agent Considerations.   This   ASU is intended to clarify   revenue recognition   accounting   when a third party is involved in providing goods or services to a customer  . The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017  , including interim periods within those annual periods  , and early application is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 16, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this   ASU   on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718)   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This   ASU is intended to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash   flows  . The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016  , including interim periods within those annual periods  , and early application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this   ASU   on its consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.   This   ASU is intended to clarify two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017  , including interim periods within those annual periods  , and early application is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 16, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this   ASU   on its co  nsolidated financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. This ASU is intended to clarify two aspects of Topic 606:   first,   assessing the collectability criterion, options for the presentation of sales and similar taxes,   noncash consideration, transition contract modifications, transition contract completion and   secondly,   technical corrections  . The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017  , including interim periods within those annual periods  , and early application is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 16, 2016. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU is intended to clarify   the presentation of cash receipts and payments in specific situations  . The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods, and early application is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

2012 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan 

On July 16, 2012, the Company adopted the Del Frisco s Restaurant Group, Inc. 2012 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan (the  2012 Plan ), which allows the Company to grant stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred stock units and other equity-based awards to directors, officers, key employees and other key individuals performing services for the Company. The 2012 Plan provides for granting of options to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price not less than the fair value of the stock on the date of grant.

The 2012 Plan has   2,232,800   shares   of common stock   authorized for issuance under the plan. There   were   1,160,600   shares   of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options   and   203,771   shares   of   unvested   restricted stock   outstanding   a  t    September 6, 2016     with     647,334   shares     of common stock   available for future grants.

LONG-TERM DEBT  

On October 15, 2012  ,    the Company entered into a credit facility that  , as last amended   on June 30, 2015,   provides   for a  n   unsecured   credit facility     with a credit commitment of   $  2  5.0   million  ,    subject to increases in increments of   $5.0   million, with a maximum amount of     $  30  .0     million.   The credit facility expires on   October 15, 2017  .    Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  , at the option of the Company, based on     (i)   LIBOR plus 1.50%   or (ii) the prime rate as defined in the credit facility  .   The Company is required to pay a commitment fee equal to   0.25%   per annum on the   available but unused   credit facility  . The credit facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company. The credit facility contains various financial covenants, including a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to EBITDA and minimum fixed charge coverage, both as defined in the credit agreement. The credit facility also contains covenants restricting certain corporate actions, including asset dispositions, acquisitions, the payment of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness and providing financing or other transactions with affiliates.  

As of   September 6, 2016  , t  here were no outstanding borrow  ings on the Company s   credit facility  ,     and the Company had approximately $  2  8  .8   million of borrowings available, with $1.  2   million in outstanding letters of credit commitments  . As of   December 29, 2015  , there w  as $4.5   million in outstanding borrow  ings   on the Company s   credit facility   and $1.3 million in outstanding letters of credit  . The Company was in compliance with all of the   financial   debt covenants as of   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  .

INCOME TAXES  

The effective income tax rate for the   12 and     36     weeks ended   September 6, 2016     was   (  12.3  )  %   and   28.3%  ,     respectively  ,    compared   to   51.9%     and   26.2%     for the   12 and     36     weeks ended   September 8, 2015  . The factors that cause the effective tax rates to vary from the federal statutory rate of   35%   include the impact of FICA tip and other credits, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible expens  es  . 

6  .  

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT  

Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value, or to disclose the fair value of certain assets and liabilities recorded at cost. Pursuant to these fair value measurement and disclosure requirements, fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid upon transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value is calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities includes consideration of non-performance risk, including the Company s own credit risk. Each fair value measurement is reported in one of the following three levels: 

Level 1 valuation inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active markets. 

Level 2 valuation inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 valuation inputs are unobservable and typically reflect management s estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques that include option pricing models, discounted cash flow models, and similar techniques. 

The following table presents   the Company s   financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , respectively (in thousands): 

There were   no   transfers among levels within the fair-value hierarchy during the first    t  hree   quarter  s   of fiscal   2016   and fiscal   2015  .    The carrying value of the Company s cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short term nature.

SEGMENT REPORTING  

The Company operates the Del Frisco s, Sullivan s, and Grille brands as operating segments. The restaurant concepts operate solely in the U.S. within the full-service dining industry, providing similar products to similar customers. Sales from external customers are derived principally from food and beverage sales, and the Company does not rely on any major customers as a source of sales. The restaurant concepts also possess similar economic characteristics, resulting in similar long-term expected financial performance characteristics. However, as Del Frisco s restaurants typically have higher revenues, driven by their larger physical presence and higher average check, the Del Frisco s, Sullivan s, and Grille operating segments have varying operating income and restaurant-level EBITDA margins due to the leveraging of higher revenues on certain fixed operating costs such as management labor, rent, utilities, and building maintenance. 

The following tables present information about reportable segments (in thousands): 

In addition to using consolidated results in evaluating the Company s performance and allocating its resources, the Company s chief operating decision maker uses restaurant-level EBITDA, which is not a measure defined by GAAP.   The Company defines restaurant-level EBITDA as income   (loss)   before income taxes, other income (expenses), net, pre-opening costs, general and administrative costs, lease termination and clos  ing   costs  , impairment charges   and depreciation and amortization  .   Pre-opening costs are excluded because they vary in timing and magnitude and are not related to the health of ongoing operations. General and administrative   cost  s are only included in the Company s consolidated financial results as they are generally not specifically identifiable to individual operating segments as these costs relate to supporting all of the restaurant operations of the Company and the extension of the Company s concepts into new   markets.   Lease termination and clos  ing   costs  , impairment charges   and d  epreciation and amortization are excluded because they are not ongoing controllable cash expenses  ,   and they are not related to the health of ongoing operations. Property and equipment is the only balance sheet measure used by the Company s chief operating decision maker in allocating resources.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

The Company is subject to various claims, possible legal actions, and other matters arising out of the normal course of business. While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these issues, management is of the opinion that adequate provision for potential losses has been made in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s   consolidated   financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

Prior to   the acquisition of Lone Star Steakhouse   Saloon, Inc.   by Lone Star Fund, the Company   s predecessor   guaranteed certain lease payments of   certain non-Company restaurants   in connection with the leasing of real estate for restaurant locations. As of   September 6, 2016  , the Company was responsible as guarantor   for   one     remaining lease   of its former a  ffiliate  . The lease expire  s   at   the end of     2016  . Th  is   guarantee will require payment by the Company only in an event of default by the former affiliate where it is unable   or unwilling   to make the required lease payments.   Management believes that the likelihood is remote that material payments   will be required under the   guarantee. At   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015   the maximum potential amount of future lease payments the Company could be required to make as a result of the guarantees was approximately   $  40  ,000    a  nd   $0.  2   million  , respectively  . 

At   September 6, 2016   and   December 29, 2015  , the Company had outstanding letters of   credit of   $1.  2   million   and $1.3   million, respectively  ,     which   were drawn on the Company s credit facility (see Note   4  ,    Long-Term Debt  )  .   The letters of credit typically act as guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions.

Overview 

Del Frisco s Restaurant Group develops, owns and operates three contemporary, high-end, complementary restaurants: Del Frisco s Double Eagle Steak House, or Del Frisco s, Sullivan s Steakhouse, or Sullivan s, and Del Frisco s Grille, or the Grille.   As of the end of the period covered by this report, w  e operate  d     50   restaurants in   23   states   and the District of Columbia  . Of the  se     50   restaurants  , there were   11   Del Frisco s restaurants, 1  8   Sullivan s restaurants and   21   Grille restaurants. 

Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to  we,   our,   us,  or the  Company  refer to Del Frisco s Restaurant Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 

Our Growth Strategies and Outlook.   Our growth model is comprised of the following three primary drivers: 

Pursue Disciplined Restaurant Growth.   We believe that there are significant opportunities to grow our concepts on a nationwide basis in both existing and new markets where we believe we can generate attractive unit-level economics. We are presented with many development opportunities  ,   and we carefully evaluate each opportunity to determine that sites selected for development have a high probability of meeting our return on investment targets. Our disciplined growth strategy includes accepting only those sites that we believe present attractive rent and tenant allowance structures as well as reasonable construction costs given the sales potential of the site. We believe our concepts  complementary market positioning and ability to coexist in the same markets, coupled with our flexible unit models, will allow us to expand each of our three concepts into a greater number of locations.  

Grow Existing Revenue.   We will continue to pursue opportunities to increase the sales at our existing restaurants, pursue targeted local marketing efforts and evaluate operational initiatives, including growth in private dining, designed to increase restaurant unit volumes.  

Maintain Margins Throughout Our Growth.   We will continue to aggressively protect our margins using economies of scale, including marketing and purchasing synergies between our concepts and leveraging our corporate infrastructure as we continue to open new restaurants.  

In general, w  e believe t  here are opportunities to open   four to   six   restaurants annually, generally composed of one Del Frisco s and   three to   f  ive   Sullivan s and/or Grilles, with new openings of our Grille concept likely serving as the primary driver of new unit growth in the near term.     D  uring 2016,   we opened one Grille restaurant and relocated one Del Frisco s restaurant   (the old location closed prior to September 6, 2016, and the new location opened   subsequent to September 6, 2016  )  . W  e expect to open   t  wo additional   Grille restaurants     prior to the end of fiscal 2016  .

Performance Indicators.   We use the following key metrics in evaluating the performance of our restaurants: 

Comparable Restaurant Sales  .    Effective beginning with the first quarter of fiscal 2016, w  e consider a restaurant to be comparable during the first full fiscal   quarter   following the eighteenth month of operations.   Previously, we considered a restaurant to be comparable during the first full fiscal period following the eighteenth month of operations  .    This change in methodology did not result in any material changes in comparable restaurant metrics.   Changes in comparable restaurant sales reflect changes in sales for the comparable group of restaurants over a specified period of time. Changes in comparable   restaurant   sales reflect changes in customer count trends as well as changes in average check. Our comparabl  e restaurant base consisted of   4  1   and   3  5   restaurants at   September     6  , 2016   and   September 8  , 2015  , respectively.  

Average Check.   Average check is calculated by dividing total restaurant sales by customer counts for a given time period. Average check is influenced by menu prices and menu mix. Management uses this indicator to analyze trends in customers  preferences, the effectiveness of menu changes and price increases and per customer expenditures.  

Average   Weekly   Volume.   Average   weekly   volume, or A  W  V, consists of the average weekly   sales of our restaurants over a certain period of time. This measure is calculated by dividing total   revenues   within a period by the number of restaurants      operating   weeks   during the relevant period. This indicator assists management in measuring changes in customer traffic, pricing and development of our concepts.  

Customer Counts  . Customer counts are measured by the number of entr es ordered at our restaurants over a given time period.  

Restaurant-Level EBITDA Margin  . Restaurant-level EBITDA margin  , a non-GAAP financial measure,     represents income before income taxes, other income (expenses), net, pre-opening costs, general and administrative costs, lease termination and closing costs  , impairment charges   and depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues  .   By monitoring and controlling our restaurant-level EBITDA margins, we can gauge the overall profitability of our core restaurant operations. See Note   7  ,    Segment Reporting   in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on restaurant-level EBITDA.  

Our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, the percentage of our annual revenues earned during the first and fourth fiscal quarters has been higher due, in part, to increased gift card redemptions and increased private dining during the year-end holiday season, respectively. In addition, our first, second and third quarters each contain 12 operating weeks with the fourth quarter containing 16 or 17 operating weeks. As many of our operating expenses have a fixed component, our operating income and operating income margin have historically varied significantly from quarter to quarter. Accordingly, results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year.

Revenues.   Consolidated revenues   increased $  2.8   million, or   4.0  %, to $  7  1.4   million in   the   third     quarter of fiscal 201  6   from $  68.6   million in the   third   quarter of fiscal 2015  . This increase was primarily driven by   $  5.6   million   in incremental revenue from   an additional   64    o  perating weeks provided by   seven   new restaurants opened   during and   subsequent to     the     third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  , partially offset   by de  creased revenue   at our comparable restaurants   and the   loss of   27   operating weeks due to the   closing   of the   Dallas Del Frisco s     restaurant   at the end of the   third   quarter   of 201  6   and the   closing of the   Palm Beach and Phoenix Grille   restaurant  s in the fourth quarter of 2015  .     The closed Dallas Del Frisco s restaurant was removed from the comparable restaurant base in the last period of the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Subsequent to the end of the third quarter, the Dallas Del Frisco s was relocated and this new location will be treated as a new restaurant opening for comparable restaurant purposes.     Co  mparable restaurant sales   de  creased   3.  0  % for   the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  6     driven by   a   3.9  %    de  crease in   customer counts, offset by a 0.9% increase   in   average check  .     During the   third   quarter of 2016, comparable r  estaurant sales experienced a 12  0 basis point   negative impact   from three   restaurants in a region that   we believe w  as   impacted by challenges in the energy industry. 

Del Frisco s revenues   de  creased $  0.  9   million, or   2.  7  %, to $  3  2.2   million in the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  6   from $  3  3  .  1   million in the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  .    The   de  crease in revenues was driven by   a 3.7% decrease in comparable restaurant sales and the loss of 3 operating weeks due to the   relocation   of the Dallas Del Frisco s restaurant in the third   quarter of 2016, offset by   $  0.7   million in incremental revenue from an additional   8   operating weeks provided by   one   new restaurant opened   during   the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  .    Comparable restaurant sales

The   de  crease in revenues was   due to a   3.2  %    de  crease in comparable restaurant sales driven by a   3  .  6  %    de  crease in customer counts  , offset by a     0.4  % increase in average check. 

Grille revenues increased $  4.2   million, or   2  0.9  %, to $  2  4.  1   million in the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  6   from $  19.  9   million in the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  . This increase was   primarily   driven by   $  5.0   million in   increment  al revenue from an additional   56   operating weeks provided by   six   new restaurants   that   opened   during and     subsequent to the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  , partially offset by   24 fewer operating weeks due to the closing of two restaurants   (which contributed $  0.  5   million in revenues during the   third   quarter of 2015)  , as well   a  s a     c  omparable restaurant sales decrease   of   1.4  % in   the   third   quarter of fiscal 2016  , which was     due to   a   1  .  7  % decrease in   customer counts, offset by a   0.3  %    in  crease in   average check  .

Consolid  ate  d cost of sales increased $  0.3   million, or   1.7  %, to $  2  0.2   million in the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  6   from $  19.9   million in the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  . This increase was primarily due to   a net   additional   37   operating weeks provided by the opening of   seven   restaurants   during and   subsequent to the     third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  . As a percentage of consolidated revenue  s, consolidated cost of sales de  creased to   2  8.  3  % during the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  6   from   29.0  % in the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  .

This decrease in cost of sales, as a percentage of   revenues, was primarily due to decreased beef costs  . 

As a percentage of revenues, Sullivan s    c  ost of sales   decreased to   30.0  %   during the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  6    from 30.3  %     in   the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  .

This in  crease in restaurant operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily due to   higher   other restaurant   operating   expenses   (including maintenance costs and donations)  ,    as well as   the   de  leveraging effect of certain fixed and semi-variable costs in relation to   reduced comparable sales   in   certain     restaurants  . 

As a percentage of revenues, Sullivan s   restaurant operating expenses   in  creased to   57.4  %   during the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  6   from   54.4  % in the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  .

Pre-opening Costs  . Pre-opening costs   de  creased by $  0.  7   million to $  1.3   million in the   third     quarter of fiscal 201  6   from $  2.0   million in the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  5   due primarily   the timing of   new restaurants under construction   versus   the prior year comparable period  . Pre-opening costs include non-cash straight line rent, which is incurred during construction and can precede a restaurant opening by four to six months. 

General and Administrative Costs  . General and administrative costs   were   remained constant   at    $  5  .  2   million    i  n the   third     quarter of fiscal 201  6     compared to   the   third   quarter of fiscal 201  5  .

General and administrative costs are expected to increase as a result of costs related to our anticipated growth, including further investments in our infrastructure. As we are able to leverage these investments made in our people and systems, we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues over time. 

Lease Termination and Closing Costs  . During the   third   quarter of fiscal 2016, we incurred approximately $  49  ,000 in charges   primarily   related to   the closure of the Dallas Del Frisco s location  .    No such charges were incurred in the comparable period in fiscal 2015.

The increase in depreciation and amortization expense primarily resulted from new assets placed in service during   fiscal   201  5     and fiscal 201  6     as well as f  rom   existing restaurants that were remodeled during   fiscal   201  5  . 

Other Expenses.   Other expenses increased by $0.3 million to $0.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from $0.1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due primarily   to the disposal of fixed assets from the closed Dallas Del Frisco s restaurant. 

Income Tax Expense   (Benefit)  .   The effective income tax     rate for the     third   quarter of fiscal   2016   was   (  12.3  )  %   compared   to     51.9  % for the   third   quarter of fiscal   2015  . The factors that cause the effective tax rates to vary from the federal statutory rate of 35% include the impact of FICA tip and other credits, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses.

Sullivan s revenues   decreased $  1.3   million, or   2.  5  %, to $  51.6   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from $  53.0   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. The decrease in revenues was the result of   22   fewer operating weeks during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016,

resulting from the closing of the Denver Sullivan s   restaurant   (which contributed $  1.1   million in revenues during the   first t  hree   quarters   of 2015)  ,     as well as a     de  crease in comparable restaurant sales. Comparable restaurant sales   de  creased   0.  7  % for the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 driven by a   2.2  %    de  crease in   customer counts  ,    partially   offset by a   1.5  %    in  crease in   average check  .   

Grille revenues increased $  1  4  .  2   million, or 2  4.3  %, to $  72.4   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from $  58.3   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily driven by $  17.9   million in incremental revenue from an additional   1  97   operating weeks provided by s  even   new restaurants opened during and subsequent to the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015, partially offset by   72   fewer operating weeks due to the closing of two restaurants (which contributed $  2.  7   million in revenues during the   first t  hree   quarters   of 2015), as well as a comparable restaurant sales decrease of 2.  1  % in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016, which was comprised of a   2.0  % decrease in average check   and   a   0.  1  %    de  crease in customer counts.    

Cost of Sales  . Consolidated cost of sales   increased $  3.3   million, or   5.2  %, to $  66.1   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from $  62.8   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to   a net   additional   1  32   operating weeks provided by the opening of   eight   restaurants during and subsequent to the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, consolidated cost of sales decreased to 28.  4  %   during the   first three   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from 28.  9  % in the   first three   quarters   of fiscal 2015.    

As a percentage of revenues, Del Frisco s cost of sales   decreased to   29.7% during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016   from 29.9% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015.  This decrease in   cost of sales, as a percentage of   revenues, was primarily due to decreased beef costs  . 

As a percentage of revenues,   Sullivan s cost of sales   decreased to     29.  7  % during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016   from 30.  1  % in   the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015  . This decrease in   cost of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was   primarily due to decreased beef  , seafood   and   wine   costs  . 

As a percentage of revenues, Grille cost of sales decreased to   25.  6  % during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from   2  6.  0  % in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. This decrease in cost   of sales, as a percentage of revenues, was   primarily due to decreased beef and seafood costs  . 

Restaurant Operating Expenses.   Consolidated restaurant operating expenses increased $  10.2   million, or   9.9  %, to $  1  1  4.1   million in the   first   three   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from $  103.8   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily due to   a net   additional   1  32   operating weeks provided by the opening of   eight   restaurants during and subsequent to the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, consolidated restaurant operating expenses increased to 4  9.1  % in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from 4  7.7  % in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. 

As a percentage of revenues, Del Frisco s restaurant operating expenses   increased to   41.6  % during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from   40.7  % during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. This increase in restaurant operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily due to higher   other     restaurant   operating   expense  s     (including higher maintenance expenses and donations)   as well as the deleveraging effect of certain fixed and semi-variable costs in relation to reduced comparable sales in certain restaurants  , partially offset by lower occupancy costs  . 

As a percentage of revenues, Sullivan s restaurant operating expenses increased to   5  2.8  % during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from   5  1.7  % in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. This increase in restaurant operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily due to higher   labor and benefits   (including wage rate increases and higher worker s compensation costs)  , other operating expenses   (including higher maintenance expenses and donations)   and   occupancy   costs  ,    as well as the deleveraging effect of certain fixed and semi-variable costs in relation to reduced comparable sales in certain restaurants  .   

As a percentage of revenues, Grille restaurant operating expenses increased to   57.5  % during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from   5  6.9  % in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. This increase in restaurant operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily due to higher labor   and benefits (including wage rate increases and higher worker s compensation costs)   and   other restaurant operating expenses     (including higher maintenance expenses and donations)   as well as the deleveraging effect of certain fixed and semi-variable costs in relation to reduced comparable sales in certain restaurants  ,     partially offset   by   lower   occupancy costs. 

Marketing and Advertising Costs  . Consolidated marketing and advertising costs   increased $0.  4   million, or   7.9  %, to $  5.3   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from $  4.9   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, consolidated marketing and advertising costs   increased     to   2.  3  %    during   the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016   compared   from 2.2%   the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. 

As a percentage of revenues, Del Frisco s marketing and advertising costs   increased to   2.0  % during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from   1.6  % in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. Marketing and advertising costs, as a percentage of revenues, increased primarily due to higher print media and other marketing costs. 

As a percentage of revenues, Sullivan s marketing and advertising costs   decreased to     2.  8  % during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 201  6   from 3.0% in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015  .   Marketing and advertising costs, as a percentage of revenues, decreased primarily due to lower public relations fees and lower broadcast media.    

As a percentage of revenues, Grille marketing and advertising costs decreased to   2.2  % during the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 compared to   2.  7  % in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. The decrease in marketing and advertising costs, as a percentage of revenues, was primarily due to   lower public relations fees and print media costs.

Pre-opening Costs  . Pre-opening costs decreased by $  1.  8   million to $  2.0   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from $  3.8   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015 due primarily the timing of new restaurants under construction versus the prior year comparable period. Pre-opening costs include non-cash straight line rent, which is incurred during construction and can precede a restaurant opening by four to six months. 

General and Administrative Costs  . General and administrative costs increased $0.  3   million, or   2.1  %, to $  1  7.  0   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from $  1  6.6   million in the   first   three   quarters   of fiscal 2015. This increase was primarily related to additional costs related to growth in the number of corporate and regional management-level personnel to support recent and anticipated growth. As a percentage of revenues, general and administrative costs decreased to 7.  3  % in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 compared to   7.6  % in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. General and administrative costs are expected to continue to increase as a result of costs related to our anticipated growth, including further investments in our infrastructure. As we are able to leverage these investments made in our people and systems, we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenues over time. 

Lease Termination and Closing Costs  . During the   first three   quarters   of fiscal 2016, we incurred approximately $  0.1 million   in charges related to   the closure of the Dallas Del Frisco s location  . No such charges were incurred in the comparable period in fiscal 2015.  

Depreciation and Amortization  . Depreciation and amortization increased $  1.  8   million, or 1  5.9  %, to $  12.8   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 from $  11.0   million in the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015.   This increase   primarily resulted from new assets placed in service during 2015 and   the first t  hree   quarters of   fiscal 2016 as well as from existing restaurants that were remodeled during 2015. 

Other Expenses.   Other expenses increased by $0.2 million to $0.4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 from $0.2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 due primarily to the disposal of fixed assets from the closed Dallas Del Frisco s restaurant. 

Income Tax Expense.   The effective income tax rate for the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2016 was 28  .3  % compared to   26.2  % for the   first t  hree   quarters   of fiscal 2015. The factors that cause the effective tax rates to vary from the federal statutory rate of 35% include the impact of FICA tip and other credits, partially offset by state income taxes and certain non-deductible expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Our principal liquidity requirements are our lease obligations and capital expenditure needs.   We expect to finance our operations for at least the next several years, including costs of opening currently planned new restaurants, through cash provided by operations and borrowings available under our credit facility.   However, w  e cannot be sure that these sources will be sufficient to finance our operations, and we may seek additional financing in the future. As of   September 6, 2016  , we had cash and cash   equivalents of approximately   $  0.8   million  . 

Our operations have not required significant working capital and, like many restaurant companies, we may at times have negative working capital. Revenues are received primarily in cash or by credit card, and restaurant operations do not require significant receivables or inventories, other than our wine inventory. In addition, we receive trade credit for the purchase of food, beverages and supplies, thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth. 

The following table presents a sum  mary of our cash flow  s for the   36   weeks ended   September 6, 2016   and   September 8, 2015   (in thousands): 

Operating Activities  .   Net cash flows provided by operating activities   de  creased $  5  .  7   million during the   36   weeks ended   September 6, 2016   as compared to the   36   weeks ended   September 8, 2015  , prim  arily due to a   $  10.3   million   de  crease related to the timing of payables  , a $3.3 milli  on decrease related to   impairment charges, a $2.4 million decrease in deferred rent obligations   and   a $1.0 million decrease rela  ted to prepaid and other assets  ,    partially   offset by a $2.  6   million increase in net income, a $  3.6   million increase in income taxes, a $1.8 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  , a $1.6 million increase in other liabilities and a   $1.7 million increase in inventories  . 

Investing Activities  . Net cash used i  n investing activities for the   36   weeks ended   September 6, 2016   was   $  20.2   million, consisting of   proceeds from the sale of   real estate on which our     old   Dallas Del Frisco s restaurant   was previously located prior to its relocation  ,    purchases of property and equipment   and a trade     name acquisition  . The   property and equipment   purchases primarily related to construction   in progress   of   two   Grille   restaurants   and one Del Frisco s restaur  ant  .    Net cash used in investing activities for the   36   weeks ended   September 8, 2015   was $  40.5   million,   consisting primarily of purchases of property and equipment. These purchases primarily related to construction of   three   Grille restaurant  s     and one Del Frisco s   restaurant   in progress at the end of the period and remodel activity of existing restaurants  .

Financing Activities  .     Net cash   used in   financing activities for the   36   wee  ks ended   September 6, 2016   was $  4.  4   millio  n, which was   primarily due to $  4.5   million   of payments on   the outstanding balance     under our credit facility  .    Net cash provided by financing activities   for the   36   weeks ended   September 8, 2015     was    $  12  .  2   million  , primarily related to the $15.1 million   of proceeds from   long-term debt  . 

Capital Expenditures  . We typically target an average cash investment of approximately $7.0 million to $9.0 million per restaurant for a Del Frisco s restaurant and $3.0 million to $4.5 million for a Sullivan s   restaurant   or a Grille   restaurant  , in each case net of landlord contributions and equipment financing and including pre-opening costs. In addition, we are currently  refreshing  a number of our Sullivan s and Del Frisco s   restaurants  . These capital expenditures will primarily be funded by cash flows from operations and, if necessary, by the use of our credit facility, depending upon the timing of expenditures. 

Credit F  acility  .    See Note 4,   Long-Term Debt   in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information   regarding our   credit facility. 

We believe that net cash provided by operating activities and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital, planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the next 24 months. We regularly review acquisitions and other strategic opportunities, which may require additional debt or equity financing.  

Common Stock Repurchase Program.     On October 14, 2014, our Bo  ard of Directors approved a   stock repurchase program authorizing   us   to repurchase up to $25 million of   our   common stock   through October 14, 2017  . Under this program, we may from time to time purchase our outstanding common stock in the open market at management s discretion, subject to share price, market conditions and other factors. The common stock repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares. As of   September 6, 2016  , we had repurchased   189,027   shares of our common stock   at a  n aggregate   cost of   approximately   $3.0 million   under this program.  

There was no common stock repurchase activity during the   36   weeks   ended   September 6, 2016  . 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

Prior to the acquisition of Lone Star Steakhouse   Saloon, Inc. by Lone Star Fund, the Company s predecessor guaranteed   certain   lease payments of certain non-Company restaurants in connection with the leasing of real estate for restaurant locations.   See Note 8,   Commitments and Contingencies   in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements   for information regarding these guarantees  . 

Accounting Policies 

There have been no material changes to the significant accounting policies from what was previously reported in the 2015 10-K.   The effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in Note 1  ,    Business and Basis of Presentation   in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

Item 3  .  

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

Interest Rate Risk 

We are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates. For fixed rate debt, interest rate changes affect the fair market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows. Conversely for variable rate debt, including borrowings available under our credit facility, interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of the debt, but do impact future earnings and cash flows, assuming other factors are held constant.   As of   September 6, 2016  , there were   no     outstanding borrowings on the Company s credit facility.     H  olding other variables constant, a hypothetical immediate one percentage point change in interest rates would be expected to have an impact on pre-tax earnings and cash flows of approximately $10,000 per $1.0 million   of   outstanding   debt  . 

Commodity Price Risk 

We are exposed to market price fluctuations in beef, seafood, produce and other food product prices. Given the historical volatility of beef, seafood, produce and other food product prices, these fluctuations can materially impact our food and beverage costs. While we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers who meet our standards as suppliers for our restaurants and enter into agreements with suppliers for some of the commodities used in our restaurant operations, there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control. We are currently unable to contract for some of our commodities, such as fresh seafood and certain produce, for periods longer than one week. Consequently, such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations. Dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation. Because we typically set our menu prices in advance of our food product prices, our menu prices cannot immediately take into account changing costs of food items. To the extent that we are unable   or unwilling   to pass the increased costs on to our customers through price increases, our results of operations would be adversely affected. We do not use financial instruments to hedge our risk to market price fluctuations in beef, seafood, produce and other food product prices at this time. 

Inflation 

22   

Table of Contents  

Over the past five years, inflation has not significantly affected our operations. However, the impact of inflation on labor, food and occupancy costs could, in the future, significantly affect our operations. We pay many of our   tipped   employees hourly rates related to the applicable federal or state minimum wage. Food costs as a percentage of revenues have been somewhat stable due to procurement efficiencies and menu price adjustments, although no assurance can be made that our procurement will continue to be efficient or that we will be able to raise menu prices in the future. Costs for construction, taxes, repairs, maintenance and insurance all impact our occupancy costs. We believe that our current strategy, which is to seek to maintain operating margins through a combination of menu price increases, cost controls, careful evaluation of property and equipment needs, and efficient purchasing practices, has been an effective tool for dealing with inflation. There can be no assurance, however, that future inflationary or other cost pressure will be effectively offset by this strategy. 

Item 4  .  

Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedure  s 

We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

The design of any system of control is based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated objectives under all future events, no matter how remote, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may not deteriorate. Because of its inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recent fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal c  ontrol over financial reporting.  

PART II   Other Information 

Item   1  .  

L  egal    P  roceedings  

We are subject to various claims and legal actions, including class actions, arising in the ordinary course of business from time to time, including claims related to food quality, personal injury, contract matters, health, wage and employment and other issues. None of these types of litigation, most of which are covered by insurance, has had a material effect on us, and as of the date of this report, we are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings and are not aware of any claims that we believe could have a materially adverse effect on our   consolidated   financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
