LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES  

    NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1: NATURE OF OPERATIONS  

NowNews Digital Media Technology Co.,
Ltd. (Formerly Forever Zen Ltd.) ( NowNews  or  the Company ) was incorporated in Nevada on March 30,
2010. On November 11, 2013, Pioneer Media Investments Co., Ltd. purchased 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock
for $135,000 in cash from two of the Company s shareholders.  Those 1,500,000 shares of common stock represented
62% of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock immediately following the sale.  As a result of the transaction,
a change in control of the Company occurred and in connection therewith. Mr. Alan Chen was elected as the Company s president
and sole director. Pioneer Media Investments Co., Ltd. is beneficially owned and controlled by Alan Chen. 

Worldwide Media Investments Corp. ( Worldwide )
was incorporated in Anguilla on June 4, 2013 under the Anguilla International Business Companies Act, 2000. Worldwide is a holding
company and has not carried out substantive business operations of its own. Mr. Alan Chen is the sole director and controlling
beneficiary shareholder of Worldwide. 

NOWnews Network Co., Ltd, ( NOWnews
Network ) was incorporated in Taipei City, Taiwan on June 8, 2006. NOWnews Network is a media company with operations
in Taiwan. NOWnews Network operates a news website and generates revenue from fees paid by advertisers in connection with the
display of graphical and non-graphical advertisements. In addition, NOWnews Network provides editing services of news articles,
pictures, and videos, and sells the broadcasting rights of its news articles, pictures, and videos. Mr. Alan Chen is a director
and former Chairman of NOWnews Network. 

In August 2013, NOWnews Network established
NOWnews International Marketing Co., Ltd ( NOWnews International ) as a 55% owned subsidiary. Mr. Shu-sen Chang, the
former Chairman and current director of NOWnews Network, and one other shareholder, own 10% and 35% of NOWnews International,
respectively. The primary business of NOWnews International is to sell advertisement spaces in its own newspapers. 

On December 27, 2013, the Board of Directors
of NOWnews Network approved the termination of operations of NOWnews International. The results of NOWnews International have
been presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. NOWnews Network has
reclassified the assets and liabilities of the discontinued entity in the accompanied consolidated financial statements. 

During September through December 2013,
Sky Media Investments, Co., Ltd. ( Sky Media ), a company incorporated in Anguilla and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company, acquired 7,999,945 common shares (or 66.3%) of NOWnews Network from Mr. Alan Chen for $1,522,388 (or NT$45 million).
Mr. Alan Chen owned 10,169,945 shares (or 84.3%) of common stock of NOWnews Network prior to the above transaction (the  Restructuring
Transaction ). 

On November 14, 2014, the Company entered
into and closed a share exchange agreement (the  Share Exchange Agreement ) with Worldwide, the shareholders of Worldwide,
and NOWnews Network. Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company issued an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares of common
stock to the shareholders of Worldwide in exchange for all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Worldwide. Immediately
following the closing of the Share Exchange, the Company had a total of 22,412,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock,
of which 6,262,400 shares were beneficially held by Alan Chen. As a result of the Share Exchange, Worldwide and Sky Media become
the Company s wholly owned subsidiaries and NOWnews Network is now Company s majority owned subsidiary in which Company
indirectly holds 66% of the equity interest. Upon consummation of the Share Exchange, Company s assumed the business of
NOWnews Network and ceased to be a shell company. 

F- 5  

On August 5, 2015, NOWnews Network, Sky
Media, Mr. Alan Chen and Ms. Tu entered a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  Stock Purchase Agreement ) with Gamania Digital
Entertainment Co. Ltd. ( Gamania Digital ) and Ta Ya Venture Capital Co. Ltd. ( Ta Ya ). Pursuant to the
Stock Purchase Agreement, NOWnews Network issued 1,650,000 and 350,000 shares to non-controlling shareholders on August 14, 2015
and September 8, 2015, respectively (see Note 9). As a result of the Stock Purchase, NOWnews Network remained the Company s
majority owned subsidiary in which Company indirectly holds 57% of the equity interest. 

The Company s fiscal year ends on
December 31st. 

NOTE 2: GOING CONCERN  

The Company s
unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of
America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. The Company has incurred significant losses and has not demonstrated the ability to generate sufficient
cash flows from operations to satisfy its liabilities and sustain operations. The Company had accumulated deficits of $7,751,902
and $4,400,189, and stockholders  deficits of $3,781,712 and $437,293 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The net losses attributable to common stockholders of $3,351,713 and $343,087 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. In addition, current liabilities exceed current assets by $3,930,181 and $497,578 as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively, representing significant working capital deficits. These matters raise substantial doubt
about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.  If
the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced to cease operations. The accompanying consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management s Plan to Continue
as a Going Concern  

In order to continue
as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plans to obtain
such resources for the Company include (1) obtaining capital from the sale of its equity securities, (2) sales of the Company s
services, (3) short-term and long-term borrowings from banks, and (4) short-term borrowings from stockholders or other related
party(ies) when needed. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing
any of its plans. 

The ability of
the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the
preceding paragraph and eventually to secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. 

NOTE 3: BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Basis of presentation:  

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Since
the Company, Worldwide, and NOWnews Network were entities under common control prior to the restructuring transaction, the Company
and Worldwide have recast prior period financial statements to reflect the conveyance of NOWnews Network to Sky Media as if the
restructuring transaction had occurred as of January 1, 2014. All significant intercompany transactions and account balances have
been eliminated. 

The functional currency of NOWnews Network
and NOWnews International is the New Taiwan dollars, however the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated
and presented in United States Dollars ($). In the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes,  $ ,
 US$  and  U.S. dollars  mean United States dollars, and  NT$  and  NT dollars 
mean New Taiwan dollars. 

F- 6  

Use of estimates and assumptions:  

The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual
results could differ materially from those results. The most significant estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements
include depreciation, useful lives of property and equipment, deferred income taxes, useful life of intangible assets and contingencies.
Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements
in the period they are determined to be necessary. 

Cash and cash equivalents:  

The Company considers all cash on hand
and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, when
purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has uninsured deposits
in banks of $0 and $100,536. 

Accounts receivable:  

The Company maintains reserves for potential
credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts,
customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate
the adequacy of these reserves. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company assessed the allowance for doubtful
accounts of $9,806 and $14,121, respectively. 

Property and equipment:  

Property and equipment are recorded at
cost less accumulated depreciation. Gains or losses on disposals are reflected as gain or loss in the year of disposal. The cost
of improvements that extends the life of property and equipment are capitalized. These capitalized costs may include structural
improvements, equipment, and fixtures. All ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 

Depreciation for financial reporting purposes
is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or lease term as follows: 

Electronic Equipment  
      3 years   
 
      Computer Equipment  
      3 to 5 years   
 
      Office Equipment and Furniture  
      3 to 5 years   
 
      Leasehold Improvement  
      Lesser of term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets   

Long-lived assets:  

The Company applies the provisions of
FASB ASC Topic 360 (ASC 360),  Property, Plant, and Equipment  which addresses financial accounting and reporting
for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets
to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360, at least on an annual basis. ASC 360 requires the impairment losses to be recorded
on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to
be generated by those assets are less than the assets  carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed
of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost of disposal. 

F- 7  

Intangible assets:  

Intangible assets consist of software,
trademark, and copyrights (see Note 6). At least annually, the Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized
when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less
than its carrying amount. Estimating future cash flows related to an intangible asset involves significant estimates and assumptions.
If the Company s assumptions are not correct, there could be an impairment loss or, in the case of a change in the estimated
useful life of the asset, a change in amortization expense. There was no impairment of intangible assets as of and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Leases:  

Lease agreements are evaluated to determine
if they are capital leases meeting any of the following criteria at inception: (a) Transfer of ownership; (b) Bargain purchase
option; (c) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property; (d) The present
value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory
costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent
of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at lease inception over any related investment tax credit
retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. 

If at its inception a lease meets any
of the four lease criteria above, the lease is classified by the lessee as a capital lease; and if none of the four criteria are
met, the lease is classified by the lessee as an operating lease. 

Revenue recognition:  

Product and service revenue is recognized
when the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred
or the service has been performed, (iii) the Company s price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection
of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured.  Payments received before satisfaction of all of the relevant
criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for product sales upon transfer
of title to the customer.  The Company recognizes revenue for services upon performance of the service.  Customer
purchase orders and/or contracts will generally be used to determine the existence of an arrangement.  Shipping documents
and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements, when applicable, will be used to verify product delivery or that services
have been rendered.  The Company will assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated
with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. The Company will record reductions to revenue
for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded.  These
estimates will be based on industry-based historical data, historical sales returns, if any, analysis of credit memo data, and
other factors known at the time. 

Post-retirement and post-employment
benefits : 

NOWnews Network adopted the government
mandated defined contribution plan pursuant to the Labor Pension Act (the  Act ) in Taiwan. Such labor regulations
require that the rate of contribution made by an employer to the Labor Pension Fund per month shall not be less than 6% of the
worker's monthly salaries. Pursuant to the Act, NOWnews Network makes monthly contribution equal to 6% of employees  salaries
to the employees  pension fund. NOWnews Network has no legal obligation for the benefits beyond the contributions made.
The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were $58,655 and $41,543 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were
$20,545 and $13,664 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other than the above, the Company does
not provide any other post-retirement or post-employment benefits. 

F- 8  

Foreign currency translation:  

The Company uses the United States dollar
( U.S. dollars ) for financial reporting purposes. The Company maintains the books and records in its functional currency,
being the primary currency of the economic environment in which its operations are conducted. For reporting purpose, the Company
translates the assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates,
and the statements of income are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting periods. Gain or loss on foreign currency
transactions are reflected on the income statement. Gain or loss on financial statement translation from foreign currency are
recorded as a separate component in the equity section of the balance sheet and is included as part of accumulated
other comprehensive income. The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries in Taiwan is New Taiwan Dollars. 

Statement of cash flows:  

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 230,
 Statement of Cash Flows,  cash flows from the Company s operations are calculated based upon the local currencies,
and translated to the reporting currency using an average foreign exchange rate for the reporting period. As a result, amounts
related to changes in assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in
the corresponding balances on the balance sheets. 

Income taxes:  

Income taxes are accounted for under the
asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will
not be realized. The deferred income tax assets were $0 as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Company applied the provisions of
ASC 740-10-50,  Accounting For Uncertainty In Income Taxes , which provides clarification related to the process
associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods remain open for review
until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given
audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company s liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material
to the Company s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations
for the given period. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management considered that the Company had no uncertain tax
positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future. 

The Company is subject to the tax authority
in Taiwan for years since incorporated. 

Earnings per share (EPS):  

Earnings per share is calculated in accordance
with ASC 260. Basic earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings
per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock instruments were converted or exercised. Options
and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period if the average stock price for the period is greater than
the exercise price of the warrants and options. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no options or warrants
were issued or outstanding. 

Discontinued operations  

Results of the Company s discontinued
entity have been presented in discontinued operations in the financial statements. See Note 1 and Note 12 for additional information. 

F- 9  

Reclassifications:  

Certain classifications have been made
to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassification had no impact on previously
reported net loss or accumulated deficit. 

Recent accounting pronouncements:  

On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standard Update 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),  a consensus of the FASB s Emerging Issues
Task Force. The Update is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement
of cash flows.  The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: Issue 1
- Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs.  Issue 2 - Settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments. . Issue 3 - Contingent
consideration payments made after a business combination.  Issue 4 - Proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims. 
Issue 5 - Proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies, including bank-owned life insurance
(BOLI) policies.  Issue 6 - Distributions received from equity method investments.  7 - Beneficial interests in securitization
transactions. . Issue 8 - Separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  The amendments
in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods
within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption
in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of
the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the
amendments in the same period. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each
period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those
issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future
impact of adopting this standard. 

In February 25,
2016, FASB issued ASU-2016-02-Leases.The amendments in this Update create Topic 842, Leases, and supersede the leases requirements
in Topic 840, Leases. The objective of Topic 842 is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report
useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease.
The FASB is issuing this Update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and
lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity
that enters into a lease (as that term is defined in this Update), with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this
Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The main difference between previous GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets
and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. The core principle of Topic
842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. All leases create an asset and a liability
for the lessee in accordance with FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, and, therefore, recognition
of those lease assets and lease liabilities represents an improvement over previous GAAP, which did not require lease assets and
lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability
to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the
lease term. When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, a lessee (and a lessor) should include payments to be
made in optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise
an option to terminate the lease. Similarly, optional payments to purchase the underlying asset should be included in the measurement
of lease assets and lease liabilities only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that purchase option. Reasonably certain
is a high threshold that is consistent with and intended to be applied in the same way as the reasonably assured threshold in
the previous leases guidance. In addition, also consistent with the previous leases guidance, a lessee (and a lessor) should exclude
most variable lease payments in measuring lease assets and lease liabilities, other than those that depend on an index or a rate
or are in substance fixed payments. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy
election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it
should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The amendments in this
Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. 

In November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-
Income Taxes. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification
Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the
information provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities
and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of
deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent
in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present a classified
statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of
an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities,
the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim
or annual reporting period. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.  

F- 10  

In February 18, 2015, FASB issued ASU
2015-02 Consolidation (Topic 810). The amendments in this Update affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate
whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation
model. Specifically, the amendments: (1) Modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are
variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities; (2) Eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate
a limited partnership; (3) Affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those
that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; (4) Provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting
entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are
similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. The amendments in this
Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial position and results of operations. 

In August 2014,
FASB issued ASU 2014-15   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). The amendments in
this Update states the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. An entity s
management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about
the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued
(or available to be issued). When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, management should consider
whether its plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. When substantial doubt is raised but is alleviated by management s
plans, the entity should disclose following information: (a) Principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt (before
consideration of management s plans); (b) Management s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events
in relation to the entity s ability to meet its obligations; (c) Management s plans that alleviated the substantial
doubt. 

When substantial
doubt is raised but is not alleviated by management s plans,, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating
that there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued), and disclose the following information: (a) Principal conditions
or events that raise substantial doubt; (b) Management s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in
relation to the entity s ability to meet its obligations; (c) Management s plans that are intended to mitigate the
conditions or events that raise the substantial doubt. 

The amendments in this Update are effective
for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application
is permitted. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

In assessing the realizability of deferred
tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not

the periods in which the net operating losses and temporary differences become deductible. Management considered projected future
taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
accrued 100% valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets based on the assessment of the probability of future realization.

Overview  

We were incorporated as Forever Zen Ltd.
on March 20, 2010 under the laws of the State of Nevada. On December 13, 2013, we changed our name to NowNews Digital Media Technology
Co Ltd. with the plan to enter into the business of internet media and news content. Prior to the Share Exchange as defined below,
we were a development stage company and had not yet realized any revenues from our planned operations. 

On November 14, 2014, we entered into
and closed a share exchange agreement (the  Share Exchange Agreement ), with Worldwide Media Investments Corp., an
Anguilla corporation ( Worldwide ), the shareholders of Worldwide, and NOWnews Network Co., Ltd., a Taiwan corporation
( NOWnews Network ). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company issued an aggregate of 20,000,000 shares
of common stock to the shareholders of Worldwide in exchange for all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Worldwide (the
 Share Exchange ). Worldwide, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Sky Media Investments Co., Ltd. ( Sky Media ),
owned 66% of all the issued and outstanding capital stock of NOWnews Network immediately following the Share Exchange. 

As a result of the consummation of the
Share Exchange on November 14, 2014, NOWnews Network became, indirectly through Worldwide and Sky Media, a majority-owned subsidiary
of the Company. We are now, through NOWnews Network, engaged in creating, collecting and distributing news and information through
our website http://www.nownews.com/ and our applications on mobile phones or tablets. 

We currently generate revenue primarily
from online advertising and marketing services and news content licensing. We historically had revenues from online product
sales in the E-commerce business and editing services for customers. Since our editing service was not profitable, we ceased this
service in December 2013. In addition, we also suspended our E-commerce business in April 2014 and eventually terminated the E-commerce
business at the end of 2015 due to the continuous loss from this business. 

On August 14 and September 8, 2015, NOWnews
Network issued 1,650,000 and 350,000 shares of common stock to new shareholders, respectively. As a result, our ownership in NOWnews
Network dropped from 66% to 57%.

website maintenance costs, and $0.05 million in labor cost. 

Gross Profit   

Gross profit for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 decreased approximately $0.03 million, or 10%, as compared to the same period in 2015, due to the substantial

million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, to $0.17 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase
in selling expenses was primarily due to the increase in labor costs resulting from the increase in the number of salespersons.

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 as Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015:   

5  

Net Revenue    

Our net revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.23 million, an increase of $0.57 million or 34% from $1.66 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to the increase in advertisement revenue.

nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.04 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $0.51
million, or 49%. The increase was mainly due to the increase of $0.39 million in advertisement and website maintenance costs, and
$0.12 million in labor cost. 

Gross Profit   

Gross profit increased approximately $0.06
million, or 9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to the increase
in revenue. Gross profit margin was 30% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 37% for the same period in
2015. Decrease in gross profit margin was primarily due to higher rate of increase in cost of revenue than that in net revenue .

of payroll, labor and health insurance, and advertisement expenses. The amount increased by $0.11 million, or 34%, from $0.35
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to $0.46 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase
in selling expenses was primarily due to the increase in labor costs resulting from the increase in the number of salespersons. 

6  

General and Administrative Expenses   

General and administrative expenses primarily
consist of payroll, welfare, labor and health insurance, post-retirement benefits, office rent and management fees, depreciation
  amortization expenses, professional services, litigation settlement payments, and expenses for other general corporate activities. General
and administrative expenses slightly increased by $1,185, from $715,878 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $717,063
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 .  

Financial advisory service fee  
related party   

Financial advisory service fee
increased by $2.97 million was due to the services provided by GIA Investment Corp. In resolution of the Company s
outstanding obligations pertaining to the services that have been rendered to the Company as of August 12, 2016, the
Company and GIA Investments Corp. ( GIA ) entered into a Financial Advisory Service Recognition Agreement (the
 Agreement ) on September 20, 2016, pursuant to which the Company agrees to issue 660,000 shares of common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, to GIA in recognition of services that have been previously rendered to the Company as of August
12, 2016.. The common stock price was $4.50 per share as of closing on August 12, 2016, the closing price as of the last
business day prior to August 15, 2016, totaling an aggregate sum of $2,970,000. Such payment obligations for the services
provided by GIA have never been agreed upon between the Company and GIA until near the date of the filing of the
Company s June 30, 2016 Form 10-Q Quarterly Report. Pursuant to the payment obligations being affirmative as of August 12, 2016, such obligations had been
accrued by the Company as expenses as of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016. Please see Note 7 for accrued financial advisory service fee   related party. On October 4, 2016, the Company issued 660,000 shares
of common stock to GIA Investments Corp. to fulfill the Agreement signed on September 20, 2016. 

Net Loss   

As a result of
the above factors, we have net loss of approximately $3.47 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
net loss of approximately $0.50 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing an increase of loss of approximately
$2.97 million, or approximately 599%. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our unaudited
consolidated financial statements are prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America applicable
to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The
Company has incurred significant losses and has not demonstrated the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations
to satisfy its liabilities and sustain operations. The Company had accumulated deficits of $7,751,902 and $4,400,189, and stockholders 
deficits of $3,781,712 and $437,293 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The net losses attributable to
common stockholders of $3,351,713 and $343,087 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition,
current liabilities exceed current assets by $3,930,181 and $497,578 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively,
representing significant working capital deficits. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining
adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.  If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital,
it could be forced to cease operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Management s Plan to Continue
as a Going Concern  

In order to continue
as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plans to obtain
such resources for the Company include (1) obtaining capital from the sale of its equity securities, (2) sales of the Company s
services, (3) short-term and long-term borrowings from banks, and (4) short-term borrowings from stockholders or other related
party(ies) when needed. However, management cannot provide any assurance that the Company will be successful in accomplishing
any of its plans. 

The ability of
the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the
preceding paragraph and eventually to secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. 

During the nine
month period ended September 30, 2016, we had a net decrease in cash of $238,272 as compared to a net increase of $385,728 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Our principal sources and uses of funds were as follows: 

Net cash used in operating activities of continuing operations was $452,116 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to net cash used in operating activities of $80,775 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The
increase of $371,341 of cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase in net loss, lower decreases in accounts
receivable and related-parties trade receivable, partially offset by the increases in accounts payable and accrued financial advisory
service fee to related party. 

Net cash used
in investing activities of continuing operations was $5,310 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $22,229 for
the same period last year. We used $5,310 in the addition of electronic equipment, computer equipment, and office equipment and
furniture during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Net cash provided
by financing activities of continuing operations was $213,099 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $510,457
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $297,358. The decrease in net cash provided from
financing activities was mainly because the Company had capital contributions from noncontrolling interest for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

7  

We believe that
our current levels of cash, cash flows from operations, and bank/related party borrowings, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated
cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, we may need additional cash resources in the future if we experience changed
business conditions or other developments. We may also need additional cash resources in the future if we find and wish to pursue
opportunities for investment, acquisition, strategic cooperation or other similar actions. If we ever determine that our cash
requirements exceed our amounts of cash and cash equivalents on hand, we may seek to issue debt or equity securities or obtain
a credit facility. Any future issuance of equity securities could cause dilution for our shareholders. Any incurrence of indebtedness
could increase our debt service obligations and cause us to be subject to restrictive operating and financial covenants. It is
possible that, when we need additional cash resources, financing will only be available to us in amounts or on terms that would
not be acceptable to us, if at all. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Basis of presentation:  

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Since
the Company, Worldwide, and NOWnews Network were entities under common control prior to the restructuring transaction, the Company
and Worldwide have recast prior period financial statements to reflect the conveyance of NOWnews Network to Sky Media as if the
restructuring transaction had occurred as of January 1, 2014. All significant intercompany transactions and account balances have
been eliminated. 

The functional currency of NOWnews Network
and NOWnews International is the New Taiwan dollars, however the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been translated
and presented in United States Dollars ($). In the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes,  $ ,
 US$  and  U.S. dollars  mean United States dollars, and  NT$  and  NT dollars 
mean New Taiwan dollars. 

Use of estimates and assumptions:  

The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to
make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting
periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made. However, actual
results could differ materially from those results. The most significant estimates reflected in the consolidated financial statements
include depreciation, useful lives of property and equipment, deferred income taxes, useful life of intangible assets and contingencies.
Estimates and assumptions are periodically reviewed and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements
in the period they are determined to be necessary. 

Cash and cash equivalents:  

The Company considers all cash on hand
and in banks, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, when
purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has uninsured deposits
in banks of $0 and $100,536. 

Accounts receivable:  

The Company maintains reserves for potential
credit losses on accounts receivable. Management reviews the composition of accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts,
customer concentrations, customer credit worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment patterns to evaluate
the adequacy of these reserves. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company assessed the allowance for doubtful
accounts of $9,806 and $14,121, respectively. 

8  

Property and equipment:  

Property and equipment are recorded at
cost less accumulated depreciation. Gains or losses on disposals are reflected as gain or loss in the year of disposal. The cost
of improvements that extends the life of property and equipment are capitalized. These capitalized costs may include structural
improvements, equipment, and fixtures. All ordinary repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. 

Depreciation for financial reporting purposes
is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or lease term as follows: 

Electronic Equipment  
      3 years   

Computer Equipment  
      3 to 5 years   

Office Equipment and Furniture  
      3 to 5 years   

Leasehold Improvement  
      Lesser of term of the lease or the estimated useful lives of the assets   

Long-lived assets:  

The Company applies the provisions of
FASB ASC Topic 360 (ASC 360),  Property, Plant, and Equipment  which addresses financial accounting and reporting
for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets. The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets
to be held and used in accordance with ASC 360, at least on an annual basis. ASC 360 requires the impairment losses to be recorded
on long-lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to
be generated by those assets are less than the assets  carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the
amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed
of is determined in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced for the cost of disposal. 

Intangible assets:  

Intangible assets consist of software,
trademark, and copyrights (see Note 6). At least annually, the Company evaluates intangible assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized
when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less
than its carrying amount. Estimating future cash flows related to an intangible asset involves significant estimates and assumptions.
If the Company s assumptions are not correct, there could be an impairment loss or, in the case of a change in the estimated
useful life of the asset, a change in amortization expense. There was no impairment of intangible assets as of and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Leases:  

Lease agreements are evaluated to determine
if they are capital leases meeting any of the following criteria at inception: (a) Transfer of ownership; (b) Bargain purchase
option; (c) The lease term is equal to 75 percent or more of the estimated economic life of the leased property; (d) The present
value at the beginning of the lease term of the minimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing executory
costs such as insurance, maintenance, and taxes to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals or exceeds 90 percent
of the excess of the fair value of the leased property to the lessor at lease inception over any related investment tax credit
retained by the lessor and expected to be realized by the lessor. 

If at its inception a lease meets any
of the four lease criteria above, the lease is classified by the lessee as a capital lease; and if none of the four criteria are
met, the lease is classified by the lessee as an operating lease.    

Revenue recognition:  

Product and service revenue is recognized
when the following fundamental criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred
or the service has been performed, (iii) the Company s price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection
of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured.  Payments received before satisfaction of all of the relevant
criteria for revenue recognition are recorded as unearned revenue. The Company recognizes revenue for product sales upon transfer
of title to the customer.  The Company recognizes revenue for services upon performance of the service.  Customer
purchase orders and/or contracts will generally be used to determine the existence of an arrangement.  Shipping documents
and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements, when applicable, will be used to verify product delivery or that services
have been rendered.  The Company will assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated
with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. The Company will record reductions to revenue
for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded.  These
estimates will be based on industry-based historical data, historical sales returns, if any, analysis of credit memo data, and
other factors known at the time.

Post-retirement and post-employment benefits : 

NOWnews Network adopted the government
mandated defined contribution plan pursuant to the Labor Pension Act (the  Act ) in Taiwan. Such labor regulations
require that the rate of contribution made by an employer to the Labor Pension Fund per month shall not be less than 6% of the
worker's monthly salaries. Pursuant to the Act, NOWnews Network makes monthly contribution equal to 6% of employees  salaries
to the employees  pension fund. NOWnews Network has no legal obligation for the benefits beyond the contributions made.
The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were $58,655 and $41,543 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The total amounts for such employee benefits, which were expensed as incurred, were
$20,545 and $13,664 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other than the above, the Company does
not provide any other post-retirement or post-employment benefits. 

Foreign currency translation:  

The Company uses the United States dollar
( U.S. dollars ) for financial reporting purposes. The Company maintains the books and records in its functional currency,
being the primary currency of the economic environment in which its operations are conducted. For reporting purpose, the Company
translates the assets and liabilities to U.S. dollars using the applicable exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet dates,
and the statements of income are translated at average exchange rates during the reporting periods. Gain or loss on foreign currency
transactions are reflected on the income statement. Gain or loss on financial statement translation from foreign currency are
recorded as a separate component in the equity section of the balance sheet and is included as part of accumulated
other comprehensive income. The functional currency of the Company and its subsidiaries in Taiwan is New Taiwan Dollars. 

Statement of cash flows:  

In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 230,
 Statement of Cash Flows,  cash flows from the Company s operations are calculated based upon the local currencies,
and translated to the reporting currency using an average foreign exchange rate for the reporting period. As a result, amounts
related to changes in assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in
the corresponding balances on the balance sheets. 

Income taxes:  

Income taxes are accounted for under the
asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to
differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases
and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment
date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of a deferred tax asset will
not be realized. The deferred income tax assets were $0 as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Company applied the provisions of
ASC 740-10-50,  Accounting For Uncertainty In Income Taxes , which provides clarification related to the process
associated with accounting for uncertain tax positions recognized in our financial statements. Audit periods remain open for review
until the statute of limitations has passed. The completion of review or the expiration of the statute of limitations for a given
audit period could result in an adjustment to the Company s liability for income taxes. Any such adjustment could be material
to the Company s results of operations for any given quarterly or annual period based, in part, upon the results of operations
for the given period. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management considered that the Company had no uncertain tax
positions, and will continue to evaluate for uncertain positions in the future. 

The Company is subject to the tax authority
in Taiwan for years since incorporated. 

Earnings per share (EPS):  

Earnings per share is calculated in accordance
with ASC 260. Basic earnings per share is based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings
per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock instruments were converted or exercised. Options
and warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period if the average stock price for the period is greater than
the exercise price of the warrants and options. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, no options or warrants
were issued or outstanding. 

10  

Discontinued operations  

Results of the Company s discontinued
entity have been presented in discontinued operations in the financial statements. See Note 1 and Note 12 for additional information. 

Reclassifications:  

Certain classifications have been made
to the prior year financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. The reclassification had no impact on previously
reported net loss or accumulated deficit. 

Recent accounting pronouncements:  

On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard
Update 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),  a consensus of the FASB s Emerging Issues Task Force.
The Update is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. 
The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: Issue 1 - Debt prepayment or debt
extinguishment costs.  Issue 2 - Settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments.  Issue 3 - Contingent consideration payments
made after a business combination.  Issue 4 - Proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims.  Issue 5 - Proceeds from
the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) policies, including bank-owned life insurance (BOLI) policies.  Issue
6 - Distributions received from equity method investments.  Issue 7 - Beneficial interests in securitization transactions. 
Issue 8 - Separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  The amendments in this Update
are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those
fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.
If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal
year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period.
The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable
to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively
as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. 

In February 25,
2016, FASB issued ASU-2016-02-Leases.The amendments in this Update create Topic 842, Leases, and supersede the leases requirements
in Topic 840, Leases. The objective of Topic 842 is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report
useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease.
The FASB is issuing this Update to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and
lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity
that enters into a lease (as that term is defined in this Update), with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in this
Update supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The main difference between previous GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets
and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. The core principle of Topic
842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. All leases create an asset and a liability
for the lessee in accordance with FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of Financial Statements, and, therefore, recognition
of those lease assets and lease liabilities represents an improvement over previous GAAP, which did not require lease assets and
lease liabilities to be recognized for most leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability
to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the
lease term. When measuring assets and liabilities arising from a lease, a lessee (and a lessor) should include payments to be
made in optional periods only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to exercise
an option to terminate the lease. Similarly, optional payments to purchase the underlying asset should be included in the measurement
of lease assets and lease liabilities only if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise that purchase option. Reasonably certain
is a high threshold that is consistent with and intended to be applied in the same way as the reasonably assured threshold in
the previous leases guidance. In addition, also consistent with the previous leases guidance, a lessee (and a lessor) should exclude
most variable lease payments in measuring lease assets and lease liabilities, other than those that depend on an index or a rate
or are in substance fixed payments. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy
election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it
should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The amendments in this
Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard. 

In November 20, 2015, FASB issued ASU-2015-17-
Income Taxes. The Board is issuing this Update as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting standards (the Simplification
Initiative). The objective of the Simplification Initiative is to identify, evaluate, and improve areas of generally accepted
accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the
information provided to users of financial statements. Current GAAP requires an entity to separate deferred income tax liabilities
and assets into current and noncurrent amounts in a classified statement of financial position. To simplify the presentation of
deferred income taxes, the amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent
in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present a classified
statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of
an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities,
the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim
or annual reporting period. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.  

11  

In February 18, 2015, FASB issued ASU
2015-02 Consolidation (Topic 810). The amendments in this Update affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate
whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation
model. Specifically, the amendments: (1) Modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are
variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities; (2) Eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate
a limited partnership; (3) Affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those
that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; (4) Provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting
entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are
similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. The amendments in this
Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2015. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated
financial position and results of operations. 

In August 2014,
FASB issued ASU 2014-15   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). The amendments in
this Update states the disclosure of uncertainties about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. An entity s
management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about
the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued
(or available to be issued). When management identifies conditions or events that raise substantial doubt, management should consider
whether its plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. When substantial doubt is raised but is alleviated by management s
plans, the entity should disclose following information: (a) Principal conditions or events that raised substantial doubt (before
consideration of management s plans); (b) Management s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events
in relation to the entity s ability to meet its obligations; (c) Management s plans that alleviated the substantial
doubt. 

When substantial
doubt is raised but is not alleviated by management s plans,, an entity should include a statement in the footnotes indicating
that there is substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date
that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued), and disclose the following information: (a) Principal conditions
or events that raise substantial doubt; (b) Management s evaluation of the significance of those conditions or events in
relation to the entity s ability to meet its obligations; (c) Management s plans that are intended to mitigate the
conditions or events that raise the substantial doubt. 

The amendments in this Update are effective
for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application
is permitted. The Company is still in progress of evaluating future impact of adopting this standard.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk.  

Not applicable.  

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

The Company maintains a set of disclosure
controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports filed under
the Securities Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC's rules
and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that this information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company's management, including the Company's chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange
Act, the Company carried out an evaluation with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s
chief executive officer, and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Based upon that evaluation,
the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Controls over
Financial Reporting   

We regularly review our system of internal
control over financial reporting and make changes to our processes and systems to improve controls and increase efficiency, while
ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control environment. Changes may include such activities as implementing new,
more efficient systems, consolidating activities, and migrating processes. 

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER
INFORMATION  

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings.   

From time to time, the Company is subject
to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged infringement of copyrights and
other intellectual property rights and other claims alleging defamation, invasion of privacy, or similar claims arising in connection
with the news articles, pictures, and other contents published on the Company s website. 

Lai Matter  

On July 11, 2014, Ms. Xiu-qing Lai filed
a claim against NOWnews Network and five other companies (the  Five Companies ) who are unrelated to the Company,
in the Taiwan Tainan District Court (the  Tainan District Court ) in connection to a news article edited by NOWnews
Network and published on July 19, 2012 on the website of NOWnews Network and five other websites owned by the Five Companies,
respectively. Ms. Lai claims that the news article contained a false statement that harms the reputation of Ms. Lai. Ms. Lai seeks
approximately $17,070 (NT$550,000) in compensatory damages from NOWnews Network, $54,314 (NT$1,750,000) in aggregate from the
Five Companies, and newspaper apologies from NOWnews Network and the Five Companies. Based on the agreements entered by NOWnews
Network and the Five Companies, if any news content provided by NOWnews Network violates any regulations or infringes on any copyrights,
NOWnews Network shall be responsible for any losses that may occur. 

On January 6, 2015, the plaintiff agreed
to settle this legal matter with NOWnews Network outside of court. NOWnews Network agreed to pay the plaintiff $12,415 (NT$400,000)
in compensatory damages, and the plaintiff agreed to revoke the claim against NOWnews Network and the Five Companies. NOWnews
Network has accrued $12,415 (NT$400,000) of contingent loss in connection to this lawsuit settlement during the year ended December
31, 2014. As of September 30, 2016, NOWnews Network has made payment of approximately $12,415 (NT$400,000) and this action is
closed.
