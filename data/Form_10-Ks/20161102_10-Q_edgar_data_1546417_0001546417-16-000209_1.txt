1  .      Description of the Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Description of the Business -   Bloomin  Brands, Inc., through its subsidiaries ( Bloomin  Brands  or the  Company ), owns and operates casual, upscale casual and fine dining restaurants. The Company s restaurant portfolio has   four   concepts: Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming s Prime Steakhouse   Wine Bar. Each of the Company s concepts has additional restaurants in which it has no direct investment and are operated under franchise agreements. 
    
  Basis of Presentation -   The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company, all adjustments necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows for the periods presented have been included and are of a normal, recurring nature. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 27, 2015  . 
    
  Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted   -   In August 2016,   the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( the FASB ) issued   Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ( ASU No. 2016-15 ) which provides guidance on the statement of cash flows presentation of certain transactions where diversity in practice exists. ASU No. 2016-15 will be effect  ive for the Company in fiscal year 2018  , and early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect ASU No. 2016-15 to have a material impact on its   financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09:  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU No. 2016-09 ). ASU No. 2016-09 simplifies several aspects related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, statutory tax withholding requirements and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU No. 2016-09 will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2017. While reducing the complexity of the accounting for share based-payments, ASU No. 2016-09 is expected to impact net income, earnings per share and presentation of cash flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02:  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU No. 2016-02 ). ASU No. 2016-02 requires the lease rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for the Company in fiscal year 2019 and must be adopted using a modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15:  Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU No. 2014-15 ). ASU No. 2014-15 will explicitly require management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern, and to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. The new standard is applicable for all entities and will be effective for the Company s fiscal year 2016 annual reporting period. The Company does not expect ASU No. 2014-15 to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09  Revenue Recognition (Topic 606), Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU No. 2014-09 ). ASU No. 2014-09 provides a single source of guidance for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes current revenue recognition standards. Under ASU No. 2014-09, revenue is

  (UNAUDITED) - Continued 

recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration an entity expects to receive for the transfer of goods and services. ASU No. 2014-09, as amended, will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2018 and is applied retrospectively to each period presented or as a cumulative effect adjustment at the date of adoption. The Company has not selected a transition method and is evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Recent accounting guidance not discussed above is not applicable, did not have, or is not expected to have a material impact to the Company. 
    
  Reclassifications -   The Company reclassified certain items in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for prior periods to be comparable with the classification for the current period. These reclassifications had no effect on previously reported net income.

Outback Steakhouse South Korea - On July 25, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Outback Steakhouse subsidiary in South Korea ( Outback Steakhouse South Korea ) for a purchase price of   $50.0 million  , in cash.

The Company also recognized tax expense of   ($1.1) million   and   $2.4 million   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  , respectively, with respect to undistributed earnings in South Korea that were previously considered to be permanently reinvested.  
    
  During the thirteen and   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  , the Company recognized a gain on the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea of   $2.1 million   within Other income (expense), net in the   Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss)  , primarily due to a change in foreign currency exchange rates subsequent to the Company s second fiscal quarter. After completion of the sale, the Company s restaurant locations in South Korea are operated as franchises under an agreement with the buyer.

Assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the weighted-average fair value of option awards granted were as follows: 

________________ 
           (1) 
    Risk-free interest rate is the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date for periods within the contractual life of the option. 
              (2) 
    Dividend yield is the level of dividends expected to be paid on the Company s common stock over the expected term of the option. 
              (3) 
    Expected term represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding. The simplified method of estimating the expected term is used since the Company does not have significant historical exercise experience for its stock options. 
              (4) 
    Volatility is based on the historical volatilities of the Company s stock and the stock of comparable peer companies. 
       
  The following represents unrecognized stock compensation expense and the remaining weighted-average vesting period as of   September 25, 2016  :

    Subsequent to   September 25, 2016  , the Company made payments on its PRP Mortgage Loan with proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions.  See Note   18   -   Subsequent Events   for further details. 
       
  PRP Mortgage Loan   - On   February 11, 2016  , New Private Restaurant Partners, LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( PRP ), as borrower, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as lender (the  Lender ), entered into a loan agreement (the  PRP Mortgage Loan ), pursuant to which PRP borrowed   $300.0 million  . The PRP Mortgage Loan has an initial maturity date of   February 11, 2018   (the  Initial Maturity ) with an option to extend the Initial Maturity for one   twelve  -month extension period (the  Extension ) provided that certain conditions are satisfied. The PRP Mortgage Loan is collateralized by certain properties owned by PRP ( Collateral Properties ). PRP has also made negative pledges with respect to certain properties ( Unencumbered Properties ).  
  The proceeds of the PRP Mortgage Loan were used, together with borrowings under the Company s revolving credit facility, to prepay a portion, and fully defease the remainder, of the 2012 CMBS loan. In connection with the defeasance, the Company recognized a loss of   $26.6 million   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  . Following the defeasance of the 2012 CMBS loan,   $19.3 million   of restricted cash was released. 
  The PRP Mortgage Loan bears interest, payable monthly, at a variable rate equal to   250   basis points above the   seven-day LIBOR  , subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.  
  At the time of the Amendment, the PRP Mortgage Loan was collateralized by   105   properties owned by PRP. The PRP Mortgage Loan permits the Company to refinance or sell the Collateral Properties and the Unencumbered Properties, subject to certain terms and conditions, including that specified release proceeds are applied against the outstanding loan balance.

Brazil Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests   - Certain former equity holders (the  Former Equity Holders ) of PGS Consultoria e Servi os Ltda. (the  Brazil Joint Venture ) have options to sell their remaining interests to OB Brasil (the  put options ) and OB Brasil has options to purchase such remaining interests (the  call options  and together with the put options, the  Options ), in various amounts and at various times through 2018, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. The purchase price under each of the Options is based on a multiple of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the business, subject to a possible fair market value adjustment. The Options are embedded features within the noncontrolling interest and are classified within the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as Redeemable noncontrolling interests. 
    
  During the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  , certain Former Equity Holders exercised options to sell their remaining interests to the Company for   $2.5 million  . These transactions resulted in a reduction of   $3.9 million   of Mezzanine equity and an increase of   $1.4 million   of Additional paid-in capital during the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  .

13  .      Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities    
    
  Interest Rate Risk   - The Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company manages economic risks, including interest rate risk, primarily by managing the amount, sources and duration of its debt funding and through the use of derivative financial instruments. The Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements. To accomplish these objectives, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps. 
  Currency Exchange Rate Risk   - The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The Company may use foreign currency forward contracts to manage certain foreign currency exposures.

DESIGNATED HEDGES 
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk -     On   September 9, 2014  , the Company entered into variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with   eight     counterparties to hedge a portion of the cash flows of the Company s variable rate debt. The swap agreements have an aggregate notional amount of   $400.0 million  , a start date of   June 30, 2015  , and mature on   May 16, 2019  . Under the terms of the swap agreements, the Company pays a weighted-average fixed rate of   2.02%   on the   $400.0 million   notional amount and receives payments from the counterparty based on the   30-day LIBOR   rate.  
    
  The interest rate swaps, which have been designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, are recognized on the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and are classified based on the instruments      maturity dates. Fair value changes in the interest rate swaps are recognized in AOCL for all effective portions. Balances in AOCL are subsequently reclassified to earnings in the same period that the hedged interest payments affect earnings. The Company estimates   $5.4 million     will be reclassified to interest expense over the next twelve months. 
    
  The following table presents the fair value, accrued interest and classification of the Company s interest rate swaps: 

____________________ 
           (1) 
    See Note   14   -   Fair Value Measurements   for fair value discussion of the interest rate swaps. 
       
  The following table summarizes the effects of the interest rate swap on   Net income   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  : 

____________________ 
           (1) 
    During the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   and   September 27, 2015  , the Company did not recogni  ze     any   gain or loss as a result of hedge ineffectiveness. 
       
  The Company records its derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross balance basis. The Company s derivatives are subject to master netting arrangements. As of   September 25, 2016  , the Company did not have more than   one   derivative between the same counterparties and as such, there was no netting. 
    
  By utilizing the interest rate swaps, the Company is exposed to credit-related losses in the event that the counterparty fails to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. To mitigate this risk, the Company enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions based upon credit ratings and other factors. The Company continually assesses the creditworthiness of its counterparties. As of   September 25, 2016  , all counterparties to the interest rate swaps had performed in accordance with their contractual obligations.

The Company has agreements with each of its derivative counterparties that contain a provision where the Company could be declared in default on its derivative obligations if the repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to the Company s default on indebtedness. 
    
  As of     September 25, 2016     and     December 27, 2015  , the fair value of the Company s interest rate swaps in a net liability position,     including accrued interest but excluding any adjustment for nonperformance risk, was   $13.0 million   and   $10.9 million  , respectively. As of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , the Company has not posted any collateral related to these agreements. If the Company had breached any of these provisions as of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , it could have been required to settle its obligations under the agreements at their termination value of   $13.0 million   and   $10.9 million  , respectively. 

14  .      Fair Value Measurements    
    
  Fair value is the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or the exit price, in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value is categorized into one of the following three levels based on the lowest level of significant input: 
                   Level 1 
      
    Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
      Level 2 
      
    Observable inputs available at measurement date other than quoted prices included in Level 1 
      Level 3 
      
    Unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data 

Fair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis -   The following table summarizes the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value by hierarchy level on a recurring basis as of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  : 

22 

     Table of Contents  
  BLOOMIN  BRANDS, INC. 
    
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) - Continued 

Fair value of each class of financial instrument is determined based on the following: 
                   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT 
      
    METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS 
      Fixed income funds and  
  Money market funds 
      
    Carrying value approximates fair value because maturities are less than three months. 
      Derivative instruments 
      
    The Company s derivative instruments include interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward contracts and commodities. Fair value measurements are based on the contractual terms of the derivatives and use observable market-based inputs. The interest rate swaps are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative using observable inputs including interest rate curves and credit spreads. The foreign currency forwards are valued by comparing the contracted forward exchange rate to the current market exchange rate. Key inputs for the valuation of the foreign currency forwards are spot rates, foreign currency forward rates, and the interest rate curve of the domestic currency. The Company incorporates credit valuation adjustments to reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements. As of September 25, 2016 and December 27, 2015, the Company has determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of its derivatives.  

Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis -   Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis relate primarily to property, fixtures and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, which are remeasured when carrying value exceeds fair value. The following table summarizes the Company s assets measured at fair value by hierarchy level on a nonrecurring basis: 

________________ 
           (1) 
    Carrying value approximates fair value with all assets measured using Level 2 inputs for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  . Sale contracts (Level 2) were used to estimate the fair value. 
              (2) 
    Carrying value approximates fair value with all assets measured using Level 2 inputs for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015  . A third-party market appraisal (Level 2) and a purchase contract (Level 2) were used to estimate the fair value.  
       
  Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments -   The Company s non-derivative financial instruments as of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015   consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and current and long-term debt. The fair values of cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their carrying amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to their short duration.

Debt is carried at amortized cost; however, the Company estimates the fair value of debt for disclosure purposes. The following table includes the carrying value and fair value of the Company s debt by hierarchy level as of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  : 

Fair value of debt is determined based on the following:                   DEBT FACILITY 
      
    METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS 
      Senior Secured Credit Facility 
      
    Quoted market prices in inactive markets. 
      PRP Mortgage Loan and 
  2012 CMBS Loan 
      
    Assumptions derived from current conditions in the real estate and credit markets, changes in the underlying collateral and expectations of management. 
      Other notes payable 
      
    Discounted cash flow approach. Discounted cash flow inputs primarily include cost of debt rates which are used to derive the present value factors for the determination of fair value. 

15.    Income Taxes 

The net decrease in the effective income tax rate for the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   was primarily due to: (i) a decrease in the tax liability recorded in connection with the sale of Outback South Korea, (ii) a reduction of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations and (iii) a change in the blend of taxable income across the Company s U.S. and international subsidiaries. 
    
  The net increase in the effective income tax rate for the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   was primarily due to the change in the blend of taxable income across the Company s U.S. and international subsidiaries and the recording of additional tax liabilities, including incremental taxes on earnings that were previously considered permanently reinvested, in connection with the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea.

16  .      Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  Litigation and Other Matters -   The Company had   $4.2 million   and   $4.5 million   of liabilities recorded for various legal matters as of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  On October 4, 2013,   two   then-current employees (the  Nevada Plaintiffs ) filed a purported collective action lawsuit against the Company, OSI Restaurant Partners, LLC ( OSI ), and   two   of its subsidiaries in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada (Cardoza, et al. v. Bloomin  Brands, Inc., et al., Case No.: 2:13-cv-01820-JAD-NJK). The complaint alleges violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act by requiring employees to work off the clock, complete on-line training without pay, and attend meetings in the restaurant without pay. The nationwide collective action permitted all hourly employees in all Outback Steakhouse restaurants to join. The suit seeks an unspecified amount in back pay for the employees that joined the lawsuit, an equal amount in liquidated damages, costs, expenses and attorney s fees. The Nevada Plaintiffs also filed a companion lawsuit in Nevada state court alleging that the Company violated the state break time rules. In November 2015, the Company reached a tentative settlement agreement resolving all claims and the cost of class administration for   $3.2 million  . The parties submitted the settlement to the Court for approval in February 2016 and received conditional approval on April 11, 2016. The Company expects final approval of the settlement in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  In addition, the Company is subject to legal proceedings, claims and liabilities, such as liquor liability, sexual harassment and slip and fall cases, which arise in the ordinary course of business and are generally covered by insurance if they exceed specified retention or deductible amounts. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to those actions will not have a material adverse impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations and cash flows. 

17  .      Segment Reporting    
    
  The Company has   two   reportable segments, U.S. and International, which reflects how the Company manages its business, reviews operating performance and allocates resources. The U.S. segment includes all brands operating in the U.S. while brands operating outside the U.S. are included in the International segment. Resources are allocated and performance is assessed by the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), whom the Company has determined to be its Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM ).

Prior to 2016, certain insurance expenses were not allocated to the Company s concepts as these expenses were reviewed and evaluated on a Company-wide basis and therefore, these costs were excluded from segment restaurant-level operating margin and income from operations. In 2016, the Company s management changed how insurance expenses related to its restaurants are reviewed and now considers those costs when evaluating the operating performance of the Company s concepts. Accordingly, the Company has recast all prior period segment information to reflect this change.

Overview 
    
  We are one of the largest casual dining restaurant companies in the world with a portfolio of leading, differentiated restaurant concepts. As of   September 25, 2016  , we owned and operated   1,270   restaurants and franchised   237   restaurants across   48   states, Puerto Rico, Guam and   20   countries. We have four founder-inspired concepts: Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba s Italian Grill, Bonefish Grill and Fleming s Prime Steakhouse   Wine Bar. 
  The casual dining restaurant industry is a highly competitive and fragmented industry and is sensitive to changes in the economy, trends in lifestyles, seasonality and fluctuating costs. Operating margins for restaurants can vary due to competitive pricing strategies, labor costs and fluctuations in prices of commodities and other necessities to operate a restaurant, such as natural gas or other energy supplies. Restaurant companies tend to be focused on increasing market share, comparable restaurant sales growth and new unit growth. Our industry is characterized by high initial capital investment, coupled with high labor costs. As a result, we focus on driving increased sales at existing restaurants in order to raise margins and profits, because the incremental contribution to profits from every additional dollar of sales above the minimum costs required to open, staff and operate a restaurant is relatively high. Historically, we have focused on restaurant growth with strong unit level economics. 
    
  Executive Summary 
    
  Our financial results for the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   (   third quarter of 2016   ) include the following: 

A decrease in total revenues of   2.1%   to   $1.0 billion   in the   third quarter of 2016  , as compared to the   third quarter of 2015  , was primarily due to the sale of 72 Outback Steakhouse South Korea restaurants in July 2016, partially offset by the net benefit of new restaurant openings and closings. 

Income from operations of   $31.7 million   in the   third quarter of 2016  , as compared to   $38.7 million   in the   third quarter of 2015  , decreased primarily due to lower operating margin at the restaurant-level and impairment charges related to our Puerto Rico subsidiary. 
       
  Following is a summary of significant actions we have taken and other factors that impacted our operating results and liquidity to date in   2016  : 
    
  Sale-leaseback Transactions   - During the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  , we entered into sale-leaseback transactions with third-parties in which we sold   88   restaurant properties at fair market value for gross proceeds of   $326.5 million  . Subsequent to   September 25, 2016  , we entered into sale-leaseback transactions with third-parties in which we sold   59   restaurant properties at fair market value for gross proceeds of   $187.0 million  . 
    
  Sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea   - On July 25, 2016, we sold Outback Steakhouse South Korea for   $50.0 million   in cash and recognized an impairment charge of   $39.6 million   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  . After completion of the sale, our restaurant locations in South Korea are operated as franchises. 
    
  Share Repurchase Programs -   During the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  , we repurchased   14.8 million   shares of common stock for a total of   $274.9 million  . We have   $165.0 million   of remaining authorization under the July 2016 Share Repurchase Program. 
    
  PRP Mortgage Loan   - In   February 2016  , PRP entered into the PRP Mortgage Loan, pursuant to which PRP borrowed   $300.0 million  . The proceeds of the PRP Mortgage Loan were used, together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to prepay a portion, and fully defease the remainder, of the 2012 CMBS loan. In connection with the defeasance, we recognized a loss of   $26.6 million   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  . In July 2016, PRP entered into an Amendment to the PRP Mortgage Loan to provide for additional borrowings of $  69.5 million  .

  Bonefish Restructuring   - On   February 12, 2016  , we decided to close   14   Bonefish restaurants. We expect to substantially complete these restaurant closings by the   first quarter of 2019  . See Note   2   -   Impairments, Disposals and Exit Costs     of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

RESTAURANT SALES 
    
  Following is a summary of the change in Restaurant sales for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  : 

The decrease in Restaurant sales in the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   was primarily attributable to: (i) the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea restaurants in July 2016 and (ii) the closing of   17   restaurants since   June 28, 2015  . The   decrease   in restaurant sales was partially offset by the opening of   56   new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base. 
    
  The decrease in Restaurant sales in the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   was primarily attributable to: (i) the effect of foreign currency translation, due to the depreciation of the Brazil Real, (ii) the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea restaurants in July 2016 and Roy s in January 2015, (iii) lower U.S. comparable restaurant sales and (iv) the closing of   20   restaurants since   December 28, 2014  . The   decrease   in restaurant sales was partially offset by the opening of   80   new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base.

Labor and other related expenses 

Labor and other related expenses include all direct and indirect labor costs incurred in operations, including distribution expense to managing partners, costs related to deferred compensation plans and other restaurant-level incentive compensation expenses. Labor and other related expenses increased as a percentage of Restaurant sales in the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirteen weeks ended September 27, 2015  . The increase as a percentage of Restaurant sales was primarily due to: (i) 1.4% from higher kitchen and service labor costs due to higher wage rates and investments in our service model and (ii) 0.3% due to the favorable resolution of a payroll tax audit contingency in the thirteen weeks ended September 27, 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of Restaurant sales primarily due to: (i) 0.7% from increases in average check per person and (ii) 0.2% impact from the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea. 
    
  Labor and other related expenses increased as a percentage of Restaurant sales in the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015  . The increase as a percentage of Restaurant sales was primarily due to: (i) 1.2% from higher kitchen and service labor costs due to higher wage rates and investments in our service model and (ii) 0.2% due to the favorable resolution of payroll tax audit contingencies in the thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of Restaurant sales primarily due to: (i) 0.3% from increases in average check per person and (ii) 0.2% from the impact of certain cost savings initiatives. 
    
  In fiscal year 2017, we expect to incur incremental expense of   $9.0 million   related to regulations enacted by the Department of Labor that raises the salary threshold for employees exempted from overtime. 
    
  Other restaurant operating expenses 

Other restaurant operating expenses include certain unit-level operating costs such as operating supplies, rent, repairs and maintenance, advertising expenses, utilities, pre-opening costs and other occupancy costs. The increase as a percentage of Restaurant sales in the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirteen weeks ended September 27, 2015  , was primarily due to: (i) 0.6% from an increase in operating expenses due to inflation and timing and (ii) 0.3% from higher rent expense, net, due to the sale-leaseback of certain properties. The increases were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of Restaurant sales primarily due to: (i) 0.4% from the impact of certain cost savings initiatives and (ii) 0.2% from increases in average check per person. 
    
  Other restaurant operating expenses increased as a percentage of Restaurant sales in the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015  .

Depreciation and amortization 

Depreciation and amortization expense increased in the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to additional depreciation expense related to the opening of new restaurants and the remodel of existing restaurants, partially offset by lower depreciation from: (i) the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea, (ii) assets impaired in connection with the Bonefish Restructuring and (iii) disposal of assets related to the sale-leaseback of certain properties. 
    
  General and administrative 
    
  General and administrative expense includes salaries and benefits, management incentive programs, related payroll tax and benefits, other employee-related costs and professional services. Following is a summary of the change in general and administrative expense for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  : 

________________ 
           (1) 
    Life insurance and deferred compensation decreased primarily due to: (i) an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance investments related to our partner deferred compensation programs during the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   and (ii) the acquisition of managing partners  interests in certain Outback Steakhouse restaurants during the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  .  
              (2) 
    Legal and professional fees were lower due to legal costs in 2015 associated with the Cardoza litigation and certain professional service fees and technology projects incurred in 2015 that supported our planned operational growth. 
              (3) 
    Foreign exchange primarily includes the depreciation of the Brazil Real. 
       
  Provision for impaired assets and restaurant closings 

Sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea   - On July 25, 2016, we completed the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea. In connection with the decision to sell Outback Steakhouse South Korea, we recognized an impairment charge of   $39.6 million   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  . 
    
  Restructuring and Restaurant Closure Initiatives   - On February 12, 2016, we decided to close 14 Bonefish restaurants. We expect to substantially complete these restaurant closings through the first quarter of 2019.

Following is a summary of expenses related to the Bonefish Restructuring and International and Domestic Restaurant Closure Initiatives recognized in   Provision for impaired assets and restaurant closings   in our   Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss)   for the periods indicated: 

We currently expect to incur additional charges of   $3.2 million   to   $5.2 million   for the Bonefish Restructuring over the next   five years  , including costs associated with lease obligations and other closure related obligations.  
    
  Other Impairments   - During the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  , we recognized impairment charges of   $3.2 million   for our Puerto Rico subsidiary. 
    
  The remaining restaurant impairment and closing charges resulted from: (i) the carrying value of a restaurant s assets exceeding its estimated fair market value, primarily due to locations identified for sale, relocation or closure and (ii) lease liabilities. 
    
  See Note   2   -   Impairments, Disposals and Exit Costs     of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
    
  Income from operations    

The decrease in income from operations generated in the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirteen weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to a decrease in operating margin at the restaurant-level and impairment charges. 
    
  The decrease in income from operations generated in the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to: (i) impairment charges related to the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea, (ii) a decrease in operating margin at the restaurant-level and (iii) higher restaurant closing costs from the Bonefish Restructuring. 
    
  Loss on defeasance, extinguishment and modification of debt    
    
  In connection with the PRP Mortgage Loan Amendment in July 2016 and the defeasance of our 2012 CMBS loan in February 2016, we recognized a loss on defeasance, extinguishment and modification of debt of   $0.4 million   and   $27.0 million   for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  , respectively. See Note   9   -   Long-term Debt, Net   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

Other income (expense), net    

The increase in other income (expense), net in the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to a gain on the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea in 2016 and a loss on the sale of Roy s in 2015. 
    
  Interest expense, net 

The decrease in interest expense, net in the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirteen weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to lower interest expense related to the refinancing of the 2012 CMBS loan in February 2016, partially offset by additional interest expense related to our Term Loan A-1.  
    
  The decrease in interest expense, net in the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to lower interest expense related to the refinancing of the 2012 CMBS loan in February 2016, partially offset by additional interest expense related to our interest rate swaps and from additional draws on our revolving credit facility. 
    
  Provision for income taxes 

The net decrease in the effective income tax rate for the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   was primarily due to: (i) a decrease in the tax liability recorded in connection with the sale of Outback South Korea, (ii) a reduction of uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statute of limitations and (iii) a change in the blend of taxable income across our U.S. and international subsidiaries. 
    
  The net increase in the effective income tax rate for the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   was primarily due to the change in the blend of taxable income across our U.S. and international subsidiaries and the recording of additional tax liabilities, including incremental taxes on earnings that were previously considered permanently reinvested, in connection with the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea.  
    
  We expect our effective income tax rate for fiscal year 2016 to range from 28.0% to 29.0%. The difference between the 2016 expected effective income tax rate and the effective income tax rate for the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   is primarily due to the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea and a reduction of uncertain tax positions related to the expiration of certain statute of limitations.

  Revenues for both segments include only transactions with customers and include no intersegment revenues. Excluded from net income from operations for U.S. and International are legal and certain corporate costs not directly related to the performance of the segments, interest and other expenses related to our credit agreements and derivative instruments, certain stock-based compensation expenses and certain bonus expenses.  
    
  Prior to 2016, certain insurance expenses were not allocated to our concepts as these expenses were reviewed and evaluated on a Company-wide basis and therefore, these costs were excluded from segment restaurant-level operating margin and income from operations. In 2016, management changed how insurance expenses related to our restaurants are reviewed and now considers those costs when evaluating the operating performance of our concepts.  Accordingly, we have recast all prior period segment information to reflect this change.

The decrease in U.S. Restaurant sales in the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   was primarily attributable to: (i) lower comparable restaurant sales and (ii) the closing of   12   restaurants since   June 28, 2015  .

  The decrease in U.S. income from operations generated in the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirteen weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to impairment charges related to our Puerto Rico subsidiary, partially offset by lower General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for the U.S. segment decreased primarily from an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance investments related to our partner deferred compensation programs. 
    
  The decrease in U.S. income from operations generated in the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to: (i) lower operating margin at the restaurant-level and (ii) higher restaurant closing costs from the Bonefish Restructuring, partially offset by lower General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for the U.S. segment decreased primarily from lower deferred compensation expense due to the acquisition of a managing partner s interests in certain Outback Steakhouse restaurants and an increase in the cash surrender value of life insurance investments related to our partner deferred compensation programs. 

International Segment 

Restaurant sales 
    
  Following is a summary of the change in International segment Restaurant sales for the   thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  : 

The decrease in Restaurant sales in the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   was primarily attributable to: (i) the sale of 72 Outback Steakhouse South Korea restaurants in July 2016 and (ii) the closing of   five   restaurants since   June 28, 2015  . The decrease in restaurant sales was partially offset by: (i) the opening of   35   new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base and (ii) an increase in comparable restaurant sales.

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued 

The decrease in Restaurant sales in the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   was primarily attributable to: (i) the effect of foreign currency translation of the Brazil Real relative to the U.S. dollar, (ii) the sale of 72 Outback Steakhouse South Korea restaurants in July 2016 and (iii) the closing of   five   restaurants since   December 28, 2014  . The decrease in restaurant sales was partially offset by: (i) the opening of   46   new restaurants not included in our comparable restaurant sales base and (ii) an increase in comparable restaurant sales. 
    
  Restaurant-level operating margin 
    
  The increase in International restaurant-level operating margin in the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirteen weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to: (i) increases in average check per person, (ii) the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea and (iii) the impact of certain cost savings initiatives. The increase was partially offset by: (i) higher commodity and labor inflation and (ii) higher operating expenses due to inflation. 
    
  The decrease in International restaurant-level operating margin in the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to: (i) higher commodity and labor inflation and (ii) higher operating expenses due to inflation. The decrease was partially offset by: (i) increases in average check per person and (ii) the impact of certain cost savings initiatives. 
    
  Income (loss) from operations    
    
  The decrease in International income from operations in the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirteen weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea, partially offset by higher franchise revenue and lower depreciation and amortization. 
    
  The decrease in International income from operations in the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   as compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily due to: (i) impairment charges related to the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea and (ii) lower restaurant-level operating margin, partially offset by costs related to the International Restaurant Closure Initiative in 2015 and lower General and administrative expense. General and administrative expense for the International segment decreased primarily from the effects of foreign currency exchange. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  In addition to the results provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we provide certain non-GAAP measures, which present operating results on an adjusted basis. These are supplemental measures of performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the following: (i) system-wide sales, (ii) Adjusted restaurant-level operating margins, (iii) Adjusted income from operations and the corresponding margins, (iv) Adjusted net income and (v) Adjusted diluted earnings per share. 
    
  We believe that our use of non-GAAP financial measures permits investors to assess the operating performance of our business relative to our performance based on U.S. GAAP results and relative to other companies within the restaurant industry by isolating the effects of certain items that may vary from period to period without correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items or that the items for which we have made adjustments are unusual or infrequent or will not recur. We believe that the disclosure of these non-GAAP measures is useful to investors as they form part of the basis for how our management team and Board of Directors evaluate our operating performance, allocate resources and establish employee incentive plans. 
    
  These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended to replace U.S. GAAP financial measures, and they are not necessarily standardized or comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. We maintain internal

guidelines with respect to the types of adjustments we include in our non-GAAP measures. These guidelines endeavor to differentiate between types of gains and expenses that are reflective of our core operations in a period, and those that may vary from period to period without correlation to our core performance in that period. However, implementation of these guidelines necessarily involves the application of judgment, and the treatment of any items not directly addressed by, or changes to, our guidelines will be considered by our disclosure committee. Refer to the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures for descriptions of the actual adjustments made in the current period and the corresponding prior period. 
    
  System-Wide Sales 
    
  System-wide sales is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes sales of all restaurants operating under our brand names, whether we own them or not. Management uses this information to make decisions about future plans for the development of additional restaurants and new concepts, as well as evaluation of current operations. System-wide sales comprise sales of Company-owned and franchised restaurants. Following is a summary of sales of Company-owned restaurants:

    Relates to a payroll tax audit contingency adjustment for the employer s share of FICA taxes related to cash tips allegedly received and unreported by our employees during calendar year 2011, which is recorded in Labor and other related expenses. In addition, a deferred income tax adjustment has been recorded for the allowable income tax credits for the employer s share of FICA taxes expected to be paid, which is included in Provision for income taxes and offsets the adjustment to Labor and other related expenses. As a result, there is no impact to Net income from this adjustment.

    Represents income tax effect of the adjustments, on a jurisdiction basis, for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively. Included in the adjustments for the thirteen weeks and thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016 is ($1.1) million and $2.4 million, respectively, for taxes related to the Outback Steakhouse South Korea sale.    

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  LIQUIDITY 
    
  Our liquidity sources consist of cash flow from our operations, cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our credit facilities. We expect to use cash primarily for general operating expenses, remodeling or relocating older restaurants, the development of new restaurants and new markets, principal and interest payments on our debt, share repurchases and dividend payments, obligations related to our deferred compensation plans and investments in technology.  
    
  We believe that our expected liquidity sources are adequate to fund debt service requirements, operating lease obligations, capital expenditures and working capital obligations for at least the next 12 months. However, our ability to continue to meet these requirements and obligations will depend on, among other things, our ability to achieve anticipated levels of revenue and cash flow and our ability to manage costs and working capital successfully. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents   - As of   September 25, 2016  , we had   $91.5 million   in cash and cash equivalents, of which   $36.2 million   was held by foreign affiliates, a portion of which would be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the United States. The international jurisdictions in which we have significant cash do not have any known restrictions that would prohibit the repatriation of cash and cash equivalents. 
    
  In connection with the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea, we no longer assert that the earnings of our South Korean subsidiary will be permanently reinvested and have, therefore, recognized tax expense of   $2.4 million   for the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  . We had aggregate undistributed earnings of   $58.7 million   for other foreign subsidiaries as of   September 25, 2016  , which we consider to be permanently reinvested and are expected to continue to be permanently reinvested. It is not practical to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on the undistributed earnings we consider to be permanently reinvested.  
    
  Sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea   - On July 25, 2016, we completed the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea for a purchase price of   $50.0 million  . 
    
  Sale-Leaseback Transactions -   During the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016, we entered into sale-leaseback transactions with third-parties in which we sold   88   restaurant properties at fair market value for gross proceeds of   $326.5 million  . Subsequent to   September 25, 2016  , we entered into sale-leaseback transactions with third-parties in which we sold   59   restaurant properties at fair market value for gross proceeds of   $187.0 million  . 
    
  Bonefish Restructuring   - On   February 12, 2016  , we decided to close   14   Bonefish restaurants. We expect to substantially complete these restaurant closings through the first quarter of 2019. Total future cash expenditures of   $10.1 million   to   $12.3 million  , primarily related to lease liabilities, are expected to occur through   October 2024  .

Capital Expenditures   - We estimate that our capital expenditures will total between $235.0 million and $255.0 million in   2016  . The amount of actual capital expenditures may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, among other things, including restrictions imposed by our borrowing arrangements.  
    
  Credit Facilities   - Our credit facilities consist of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and the PRP Mortgage Loan. See Note   9   -   Long-term Debt, Net   of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Following is a summary of principal payments and debt issuance from   December 27, 2015   to   September 25, 2016  : 

We continue to evaluate whether we will make further payments of our outstanding debt ahead of scheduled maturities. Following is a summary of our outstanding credit facilities as of   September 25, 2016  :

    During the   thirteen weeks ended September 25, 2016  , PRP entered into an amendment to its existing PRP Mortgage Loan. See Note   9   -   Long-term Debt, Net   for further discussion. 
       
  Credit Agreement   - As of   September 25, 2016  , we had   $151.2 million   in available unused borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility, net of letters of credit of   $27.8 million  .  
    
  The Credit Agreement contains mandatory prepayment requirements for Term loan A and Term loan A-1 at 50% of our annual excess cash flow, as defined in the Credit Agreement. The amount of outstanding Term loan A and Term loan A-1 required to be prepaid may vary based on our leverage ratio and year end results. Other than the required minimum amortization premiums of   $25.3 million  , we do not anticipate any other payments will be required through September 24, 2017. 
  PRP Mortgage Loan   - On   February 11, 2016  , PRP, as borrower, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Lender, entered into the PRP Mortgage Loan, pursuant to which PRP borrowed   $300.0 million  . The PRP Mortgage Loan has  
  
    50 

     Table of Contents

  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued 

an Initial Maturity date of   February 11, 2018   with an option to extend the Initial Maturity for one   twelve  -month Extension provided that certain conditions are satisfied. The PRP Mortgage Loan is collateralized by certain properties owned by PRP. PRP has also made negative pledges with respect to certain unencumbered properties.  
  The proceeds of the PRP Mortgage Loan were used, together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility, to prepay a portion, and fully defease the remainder, of the 2012 CMBS loan. In connection with the defeasance, we recognized a loss of   $26.6 million   during the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  . Following the defeasance of the 2012 CMBS loan,   $19.3 million   of restricted cash was released. 
  On July 27, 2016, PRP and the Lender, entered into an Amendment to PRP s Original Loan Agreement to provide for additional borrowings of   $69.5 million  . Subsequent to   September 25, 2016  , we made payments of   $121.9 million   on our PRP Mortgage Loan with proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions. The remaining   $50.9 million   PRP Mortgage Loan balance is due on the Initial Maturity date unless the we exercise the Extension. 
    
  Debt Covenants   - Our Credit Agreement and PRP Mortgage Loan contain various financial and non-financial covenants. A violation of these covenants could negatively impact our liquidity by restricting our ability to borrow under the revolving credit facility and cause an acceleration of the amounts due under the credit facilities. See Note 12 -   Long-term Debt, Net   in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 27, 2015 for further information. 
    
  As of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , we were in compliance with our debt covenants. We believe that we will remain in compliance with our debt covenants during the next 12 months. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk -     On September 9, 2014, we entered into variable-to-fixed interest rate swap agreements with eight     counterparties to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate debt. The swap agreements have an aggregate notional amount of   $400.0 million  , a start date of   June 30, 2015  , and mature on   May 16, 2019  . Under the terms of the swap agreements, we pay a weighted-average fixed rate of   2.02%   on the   $400.0 million   notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the   30-day LIBOR   rate. We estimate   $5.4 million     will be reclassified to interest expense over the next twelve months.   See Note   13   -   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities     of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. 
    
  Brazil Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests   - Certain Former Equity Holders of the Brazil Joint Venture have options to sell us their remaining interests and we have options to purchase such remaining interests (the  call options  and together with the put options, the  Options ), in various amounts and at various times through 2018, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances. The purchase price under each of the Options is based on a multiple of adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of the business, subject to a possible fair market value adjustment.  
    
  SUMMARY OF CASH FLOWS 
    
  The following table presents a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities for the periods indicated:

     Table of Contents

  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Continued 

Operating activities   - Net cash provided by operating activities decreased during the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016  , as compared to the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015   primarily due to higher income tax payments and the timing of accounts payable payments. These decreases were partially offset by: (i) utilization of inventory on hand, (ii) the timing of collections of gift card receivables and (iii) lower cash interest payments. 
    
  Investing activities -   Net cash provided by investing activities for the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   consisted primarily of: (i) proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions, (ii) proceeds from the sale of Outback Steakhouse South Korea and (iii) a reduction in restricted cash related to the defeasance of the 2012 CMBS loan, partially offset by capital expenditures.  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015   consisted primarily of capital expenditures, partially offset by the following: (i) net proceeds from life insurance policies, (ii) the release of escrow cash related to the Brazil Joint Venture acquisition, (iii) proceeds from the sale of Roy s and (iv) proceeds from the disposal of property, fixtures and equipment.  
    
  Financing activities -   Net cash used in financing activities for the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2016   was primarily attributable to the following: (i) the defeasance of the 2012 CMBS loan and payments on our revolving credit facility and PRP Mortgage Loan, (ii) the repurchase of common stock, (iii) payment of cash dividends on our common stock, (iv) repayments of partner deposits and accrued partner obligations and (v) the purchase of outstanding limited partnership interests in certain restaurants. Net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by drawdowns on our revolving credit facility and proceeds from the PRP Mortgage Loan. 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities for the   thirty-nine weeks ended September 27, 2015   was primarily attributable to the following: (i) repayments of the Term loan B due to the Senior Secured Credit Facility refinancing in March 2015 and payments on our revolving credit facility, (ii) the repurchase of common stock, (iii) repayments of partner deposits and accrued partner obligations and (iv) payment of cash dividends on our common stock. Net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by the following: (i) proceeds from the refinancing of the Senior Secured Credit Facility and revolving credit facilities and (ii) proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 
    
  FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  Following is a summary of our current assets, current liabilities and working capital: 

Working capital (deficit) totaled   ($423.7) million   and   ($395.5) million   as of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , respectively, and included Unearned revenue from unredeemed gift cards of   $242.4 million   and   $382.6 million   as of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , respectively. We have, and in the future may continue to have, negative working capital balances (as is common for many restaurant companies). We operate successfully with negative working capital because cash collected on restaurant sales is typically received before payment is due on our current liabilities, and our inventory turnover rates require relatively low investment in inventories. Additionally, ongoing cash flows from restaurant operations and gift card sales are used to service debt obligations and to make capital expenditures.

Deferred Compensation Programs -   The deferred compensation obligation due to managing and chef partners was   $120.1 million   and   $133.2 million   as of   September 25, 2016   and   December 27, 2015  , respectively. We invest in various corporate-owned life insurance policies, which are held within an irrevocable grantor or  rabbi  trust account for settlement of our obligations under the deferred compensation plans. The rabbi trust is funded through our voluntary contributions. The unfunded obligation for managing and chef partners  deferred compensation was   $59.2 million   as of   September 25, 2016  . 
    
  We use capital to fund the deferred compensation plans and currently expect annual cash funding of $18.0 million to $22.0 million. Actual funding of the deferred compensation obligations and future funding requirements may vary significantly depending on the actual performance compared to targets, timing of deferred payments of partner contracts, forfeiture rates, number of partner participants, growth of partner investments and our funding strategy. 
    
  DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES 
    
  In August 2015, our Board approved the 2015 Share Repurchase Program under which we were authorized to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Our Board canceled the remaining $30.0 million of authorization under the 2015 Share Repurchase Program and approved a new $250.0 million authorization on February 12, 2016. 
    
  On   July 26, 2016  , the Board canceled the remaining   $110.1 million   of authorization under the 2016 Share Repurchase Program and approved a new   $300.0 million   authorization (the  July 2016 Share Repurchase Program ). The July 2016 Share Repurchase Program will expire on   January 26, 2018  . Under the July 2016 Share Repurchase Program, shares may be repurchased in open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act, or privately negotiated transactions, including accelerated repurchase arrangements.

Your bonus payout for the 2016 fiscal year will be prorated based on your time in each job at the respective targets, through the end of the fiscal year, provided that you remain employed by the Employer through the payout date. 
    
  You will remain eligible for the 2016 annual long-term incentive grant. In addition, you will be eligible for the 2017 annual long-term incentive grant. Per the current plan, you may be eligible for a target up to 125% of your base salary, which will be subject to company and individual performance.

  Restrictive Covenant - Non-disclosure; Non-solicitation; Non-piracy 
  4.    Except in the performance of your duties hereunder, at no time during your employment with the Company or the Employer, or at any time thereafter, shall you, individually or jointly with others, for your benefit of or for the benefit of  any third party, publish, disclose, use or authorize anyone else to publish, disclose or use any secret or confidential material or information relating to any aspect of the business or operations of the Employer, the Company or any of their affiliates, including, without limitation, any secret or confidential information relating to the business, customers, trade or industrial practices, trade secrets, technology, recipes, product specifications, restaurant operating techniques and procedures, marketing techniques and procedures, financial data, processes, vendors and other information or know-how of the Employer,  the Company or any of their affiliates,  except (i) to the extent required by law, regulation or valid subpoena, or (ii) to the extent that such information or material becomes publicly known or available through no fault of your own. 
  5.    Moreover, during your employment with the Employer and for two (2) years thereafter, except as is the result of a broad solicitation that is not targeting employees of the Employer, the Company or any of their franchisees or affiliates, you shall not offer employment to, or hire, any employee of the Employer, the Company or any of their franchisees or affiliates,  or otherwise directly or indirectly solicit or induce any employee of the Employer, the Company or any of their franchisees or affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Employer, the Company or any of their franchisees or affiliates; nor shall you act as an officer, director, employee, partner, independent contractor, consultant, principal, agent, proprietor, owner or part owner, or in any other capacity, of or for any person or entity that solicits or otherwise induces any employee of the Employer, the Company or any of their franchisees or affiliates to terminate his or her employment with the Employer, the Company or any of their franchisees or affiliates. 
    
  Restrictive Covenant - Company and Employer Property: Duty to Return    
    
  6.    All Employer and Company property and assets, including but not limited to products, recipes, product specifications, training materials, employee selection and testing materials, marketing and advertising materials, special event, charitable and community activity materials, customer correspondence, internal memoranda, products and designs, sales information, project files, price lists, customer and vendor lists, prospectus reports, customer or vendor information, sales literature, territory printouts, call books, notebooks, textbooks, and all other like information or products, including but not limited to all copies, duplications, replications, and derivatives of such information or products, now in your possession or acquired by you while in the employ of the Employer shall be the exclusive property of the Employer and shall be returned to the Employer no later than the date of your last day of work with the Employer. 

Restrictive Covenant - Inventions, Ideas, Processes, and Designs    
    
  7.    All inventions, ideas, recipes, processes, programs, software and designs (including all improvements) related to the business of the Employer or the Company shall be disclosed in writing promptly to the Employer, and shall be the sole and exclusive property of the Employer, if either (i) conceived, made or used by you during the course of the your employment with the Employer (whether or not actually conceived during regular business hours) or (ii) made or used by you for a period of six (6) months subsequent to the termination or expiration of such employment. Any invention, idea, recipe, process, program, software or design (including an improvement) shall be deemed  related to the business of the Employer or the Company  if (i) it was made with equipment, facilities or confidential information of the Employer or the Company, (ii) results from work performed by you for the Employer or the Company or (iii) pertains to the current business or demonstrably anticipated research or development work of the Employer or the Company. You shall cooperate with the Employer and its attorneys in the preparation of patent and copyright applications for such developments and, upon request, shall promptly assign all such inventions, ideas, recipes, processes and designs to the Employer. The decision to file for patent or copyright protection or to maintain such development as a trade secret shall be in the sole discretion of the Employer, and you shall be bound by such decision. You shall provide, on the back of this Agreement, a complete list of all inventions, ideas, recipes, processes and designs if any, patented or unpatented, copyrighted or non-copyrighted, including a brief description, that you made or conceived prior to your employment with the Employer, and that, therefore, are excluded from the scope of the employment with the Employer. 
    
  The restrictive covenants contained in this agreement are given and made by you to induce the  Employer to employ you and to enter into this Agreement with you, and you hereby acknowledge that employment with the Employer is sufficient consideration for these restrictive covenants. The restrictive covenants shall be construed as agreements independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action you may have against the Employer or the Company, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of any restrictive covenant. The refusal or failure of the Employer or the Company to enforce any restrictive covenant of this agreement (or any similar agreement) against any other employee, agent, or independent contractor, for any reason, shall not  constitute a defense to the enforcement by the  Employer or  the Company of any such restrictive covenant, nor shall it give rise to any claim or cause of action by you against the Employer or the Company. 
    
  You agree that a breach of any of the restrictive covenants contained in this agreement will cause irreparable injury to the Employer and the Company for which the remedy at law will be inadequate and would be difficult to ascertain and therefore, in the event of the breach or threatened breach of any such covenants, the Employer and the Company shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have at law or in equity, to obtain an injunction to restrain you from any threatened or actual activities in violation of any such covenants. You hereby consent and agree that temporary and permanent injunctive relief may be granted in any proceedings that might be brought to enforce any such covenants without the necessity of proof of actual damages, and in the event the Employer or the Company does apply for such an injunction, you shall not raise as a defense thereto that the Employer or the Company has an adequate remedy at law.  
    
  For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this agreement for any reason, shall not extinguish your obligations specified in these restrictive covenants. 

ALL PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT FACTUAL AND LEGAL ISSUES. 
    
  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY. 
    
  THE PARTIES INTEND THAT THIS WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL BE AS BROAD AS POSSIBLE. BY THEIR SIGNATURES BELOW, THE PARTIES PROMISE, WARRANT AND REPRESENT  THAT THEY WILL NOT PLEAD FOR,  REQUEST OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO HAVE A JURY TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY ARISE BY, BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM. 
    
  You shall be responsible for the payment of all taxes applicable to payments or benefits received from the Employer or the Company.  It is the intent of the Employer and the Company that the provisions of this agreement and all other plans and programs sponsored by the Employer and the Company be interpreted to comply in all respects with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, however, the Employer and the Company shall have no liability to you, or any of your successors or beneficiaries, in the event taxes, penalties or excise taxes may ultimately be determined to be applicable to any payment or benefit received by you or your successors or beneficiaries. 
    
  The validity, interpretation, and performance of this agreement shall be governed, interpreted, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to the principles of comity or conflicts of laws thereof. 
    
  This letter constitutes the full commitments which have been extended to you and shall supersede any prior agreements whether oral or written. However, this does not constitute a contract of employment for any period of time. Should you have any questions regarding these commitments or your ability to conform to Bloomin  Brands policies and procedures, please let me know immediately.

  Restrictive Covenant - Inventions, Ideas, Processes, and Designs    
    
  7.    All inventions, ideas, recipes, processes, programs, software and designs (including all improvements) related to the business of the Employer or the  Company shall be  disclosed in writing promptly to the  Employer,  and shall be the sole  and exclusive property of the Employer, if either (i) conceived, made or used by you during the course of the your employment with the Employer (whether or not actually conceived during regular business hours) or (ii) made or used by you for a period of six (6) months subsequent to the termination or expiration of such employment. Any invention, idea, recipe, process, program, software or design (including an improvement) shall be deemed  related to the business of the Employer or the Company  if (i) it was made with equipment, facilities or confidential information of the Employer or the Company, (ii) results from work performed by you for the Employer or the Company or (iii) pertains to the current business or demonstrably anticipated research or development work of the Employer or the Company. You shall cooperate with the Employer and its attorneys in the preparation of patent and copyright applications for such developments and, upon request, shall promptly assign all such inventions, ideas, recipes, processes and designs to the Employer. The decision to file for patent or copyright protection or to maintain such development as a trade secret shall be in the sole discretion of the Employer, and you shall be bound by such decision. You shall provide, on the back of this Agreement, a complete list of all inventions, ideas, recipes, processes and designs if any, patented or unpatented, copyrighted or non-copyrighted, including a brief description, that you made or conceived prior to your employment with the Employer, and that, therefore, are excluded from the scope of the employment with the Employer. 
    
  The restrictive covenants contained in this agreement are given and made by you to induce the Employer to employ you and to enter into this Agreement with you, and you hereby acknowledge that employment with the Employer is sufficient consideration for these restrictive covenants. The restrictive covenants shall be construed as agreements independent of any other provision in this Agreement, and the existence of any claim or cause of action you may have against the Employer or the Company, whether predicated upon this Agreement or otherwise, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement of any restrictive covenant. The refusal or failure of the Employer or the Company to enforce any restrictive covenant of this agreement (or any similar agreement) against any other employee, agent, or independent contractor, for any reason, shall not constitute a defense to the enforcement by the  Employer or the  Company of any such restrictive covenant, nor shall it give rise to any claim or cause of action by you against the Employer or the Company. 
    
  You agree that a breach of any of the restrictive covenants contained in this agreement will cause irreparable injury to the Employer and the Company for which the remedy at law will be inadequate and would be difficult to ascertain and therefore, in the event of the breach or threatened breach of any such covenants, the Employer and the Company shall be entitled, in addition to any other rights and remedies it may have at law or in equity, to obtain an injunction to restrain you from any threatened or actual activities in violation of any such covenants. You hereby consent and agree that temporary and permanent injunctive relief may be granted in any proceedings that might be brought to enforce any such covenants without the necessity of proof of actual damages, and in the event the Employer or the Company does apply for such an injunction, you shall not raise as a defense thereto that the Employer or the Company has an adequate remedy at law.  
  For the avoidance of doubt, the termination of this agreement for any reason, shall not extinguish your obligations specified in these restrictive covenants. 

ALL PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THEY HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT WILL INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT FACTUAL AND LEGAL ISSUES. 
    
  THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT ANY OF THEM MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS PARAGRAPH WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED-FOR AGREEMENT AMONG THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY TO WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY AND THAT ANY PROCEEDING WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS SHALL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY. 
    
  THE PARTIES INTEND THAT THIS WAIVER OF THE RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL BE AS BROAD AS POSSIBLE. BY THEIR SIGNATURES BELOW, THE PARTIES PROMISE, WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT THEY WILL NOT PLEAD FOR, REQUEST OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO HAVE A JURY TO RESOLVE ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY ARISE BY, BETWEEN OR AMONG THEM. 
    
  You shall be responsible for the payment of all taxes applicable to payments or benefits received from the Employer or the Company. It is the intent of the Employer and the Company that the provisions of this agreement and all other plans and programs sponsored by the Employer and the Company be interpreted to comply in all respects with Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, however, the Employer and the Company shall have no liability to you, or any of your successors or beneficiaries, in the event taxes, penalties or excise taxes may ultimately be determined to be applicable to any payment or benefit received by you or your successors or beneficiaries. 
    
  The validity, interpretation, and performance of this agreement shall be governed, interpreted, and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Florida without giving effect to the principles of comity or conflicts of laws thereof.
