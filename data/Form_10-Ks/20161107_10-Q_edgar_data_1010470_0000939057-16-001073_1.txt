PROVIDENT FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC. 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
    
  September 30, 2016 

Note 1: Basis of Presentation 
    
  The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present a fair statement of the results of operations for the interim periods presented.  All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature.  The condensed consolidated statement of financial condition at June 30, 2016 is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. (the  Bank ) (collectively, the  Corporation ).  Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) with respect to interim financial reporting.  It is recommended that these unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016.  The results of operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending June 30, 2017. 

Note 2: Accounting Standard Updates ( ASU ) 
    
  There have been no accounting standard updates or changes in the status of their adoptions that are applicable to the Corporation as previously disclosed in Note 1 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

Note 3: Earnings Per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that would then share in the earnings of the entity. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were outstanding options to purchase   932,000   shares and   1.0 million   shares of the Corporation s common stock, respectively, of which   200,000   shares and   236,500   shares, respectively, were excluded from the diluted EPS computation as their effect was anti-dilutive.  As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were outstanding restricted stock awards of   110,250   shares and   197,500   shares, respectively, all of which have dilutive effects.  

6 

The following table provides the basic and diluted EPS computations for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

7 

Note 4: Operating Segment Reports 
    
  The Corporation operates in   two   business segments: community banking through the Bank and mortgage banking through Provident Bank Mortgage ( PBM ), a division of the Bank. 
    
  The following tables set forth condensed consolidated statements of operations and total assets for the Corporation s operating segments for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

(1)   
    Includes an inter-company charge of   $95   credited to PBM by the Bank during the period to compensate PBM for originating loans held for investment. 
               (2)   
    Includes an inter-company charge of   $59   credited to PBM by the Bank during the period to compensate PBM for servicing fees on loans sold on a servicing retained basis. 
     
   8 

(1)   
    Includes an inter-company charge of   $65   credited to PBM by the Bank during the period to compensate PBM for originating loans held for investment. 
               (2)   
    Includes an inter-company charge of   $108   credited to PBM by the Bank during the period to compensate PBM for servicing fees on loans sold on a servicing retained basis.

Note 5: Investment Securities 
    
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016   were as follows: 

(1)   
    Mortgage-Backed Securities ( MBS ). 
               (2)   
    Collateralized Mortgage Obligations ( CMO ). 

In the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Corporation received MBS principal payments of   $4.0 million   and   $650,000  , respectively, and there were no sales of investment securities during these periods.  The Corporation did not purchase  any investment securities in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2016.  In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Corporation received the cash proceeds from its equity investment in a community development financial institution, consistent with the purchase agreement between the acquiring institution and the community development financial institution.  

10 

The Corporation held investments with an unrealized loss position of   $0   at September 30, 2016 and   $1,000   at June 30, 2016.

The Corporation evaluates individual investment securities quarterly for other-than-temporary declines in market value.  As of June 30, 2016, the unrealized holding loss was less than 12 months.  The Corporation does not believe that there are any other-than-temporary impairments on the investment securities at September 30, 2016 and 2015; therefore,   no   impairment losses were recorded for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  Contractual maturities of investment securities as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 were as follows: 

11 

Note 6: Loans Held for Investment 
    
  Loans held for investment, net of fair value adjustments, consisted of the following: 

As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had   $10.0 million   in mortgage loans that are subject to negative amortization, consisting of   $6.9 million   in multi-family loans,   $3.0 million   in single-family loans and   $155,000   in commercial real estate loans.  This compares to   $10.2 million   of negative amortization mortgage loans at June 30, 2016, consisting of   $6.9 million   in multi-family loans,   $3.1 million   in single-family loans and   $170,000   in commercial real estate loans.  During the first quarters of fiscal 2017 and 2016,   no   loan interest income was added to the negative amortization loan balance.  Negative amortization involves a greater risk to the Corporation because the loan principal balance may increase by a range of   110%   to   115%   of the original loan amount during the period of negative amortization and because the loan payment may increase beyond the means of the borrower when loan principal amortization is required.  Also, the Corporation has originated interest-only ARM loans, which typically have a fixed interest rate for the first   two   to   five   years coupled with an interest only payment, followed by a periodic adjustable rate and a fully amortizing loan payment.  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the interest-only ARM loans were   $53.7 million   and   $64.7 million  , or   6.2%   and   7.6%   of loans held for investment, respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had   $5.5 million   of single-family loans,   19   loans, held for investment which were originated for sale but were subsequently transferred to loans held for investment and are carried at fair value.  This compares to   $5.2 million   of single-family loans,   18   loans, held for investment at June 30, 2016 which were originated for sale but were subsequently transferred to loans held for investment and are carried at fair value. 
    
  The following table sets forth information at September 30, 2016 regarding the dollar amount of loans held for investment that are contractually repricing during the periods indicated, segregated between adjustable rate loans and fixed rate loans.  Fixed-rate loans comprised   3%   of loans held for investment at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016.  Adjustable rate loans having no stated repricing dates that reprice when the index they are tied to reprices (e.g. prime rate index) and checking account overdrafts are reported as repricing within one year.  The table does not include any estimate of prepayments which may cause the Corporation s actual repricing experience to differ materially from that shown. 

12 

The Corporation has developed an internal loan grading system to evaluate and quantify the Bank s loans held for investment portfolio with respect to quality and risk.  Management continually evaluates the credit quality of the Corporation s loan portfolio and conducts a quarterly review of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses using quantitative and qualitative methods. The Corporation has adopted an internal risk rating policy in which each loan is rated for credit quality with a rating of pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful or loss.  The two primary components that are used during the loan review process to determine the proper allowance levels are individually evaluated allowances and collectively evaluated allowances.  Quantitative loan loss factors are developed by determining the historical loss experience, expected future cash flows, discount rates and collateral fair values, among others.  Qualitative loan loss factors are developed by assessing general economic indicators such as gross domestic product, retail sales, unemployment rates, employment growth, California home sales and median California home prices.  The Corporation assigns individual factors for the quantitative and qualitative methods for each loan category and each internal risk rating.  
    
  The Corporation categorizes all of the loans held for investment into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of the borrower to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors.  A description of the general characteristics of the risk grades is as follows: 

Pass - These loans range from minimal credit risk to average, but still acceptable, credit risk.  The likelihood of loss is considered remote. 
                
    Special Mention - A Special Mention asset has potential weaknesses that may be temporary or, if left uncorrected, may result in a loss.  While concerns exist, the bank is currently protected and loss is considered unlikely and not imminent. 
                
    Substandard - A substandard loan is inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any.  Loans so classified must have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, that may jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  A substandard loan is characterized by the distinct possibility that the Bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
                
    Doubtful - A doubtful loan has all of the weaknesses inherent in one classified as substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of the currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.  
                
    Loss - A loss loan is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the institution is not warranted. 

13 

The following tables summarize gross loans held for investment, net of fair value adjustments, by loan types and risk category at the dates indicated: 

The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loans held for investment and upon management s continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loans held for investment.  These factors include changes in the size and composition of the loans held for investment, actual loan loss experience, current economic conditions, detailed analysis of individual loans for which full collectability may not be assured, and determination of the realizable value of the collateral securing the loans.  The provision (recovery) for (from) the allowance for loan losses is charged (credited) against operations on a quarterly basis, as necessary, to maintain the allowance at appropriate levels.  Although management believes it uses the best information available to make such determinations, there can be no assurance that regulators, in reviewing the Corporation s loans held for investment, will not request a significant increase in its allowance for loan losses.  Future adjustments to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary and results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected as a result of economic, operating, regulatory, and other conditions beyond the Corporation s control. 
    
  Non-performing loans are charged-off to their fair market values in the period the loans, or portion thereof, are deemed uncollectible, generally after the loan becomes   150   days delinquent for real estate secured first trust deed loans and   120   days delinquent for commercial business or real estate secured second trust deed loans.  For loans that were modified from their original terms, were re-underwritten and identified in the Corporation s asset quality reports as troubled debt restructurings ( restructured loans ), the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes   90   days delinquent; and where borrowers file bankruptcy, the charge-off occurs when the loan becomes   60   days delinquent.  The amount of the charge-off is determined by comparing the loan balance to the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral, less disposition costs, with the loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value charged-off against the allowance for loan losses.  The allowance for loan losses for non-performing loans is determined by applying Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )   310  ,  Receivables.   For restructured loans that are less than   90   days delinquent, the allowance for loan losses are segregated into (a) individually evaluated allowances for those loans with applicable discounted cash flow calculations still in their restructuring period, classified lower than pass, and  containing an embedded loss component or (b) collectively evaluated allowances based on the aggregated pooling method.  For non-performing loans less than   60   days delinquent where the borrower has filed bankruptcy, the collectively evaluated allowances are assigned based on the aggregated pooling method.  For non-performing commercial real estate loans, an individually evaluated allowance is derived based on the loan's discounted cash flow fair value (for restructured loans) or collateral fair value less estimated selling costs and if the fair value is higher than the loan balance, no allowance is required.

The following table summarizes the Corporation s allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016:

The following table is provided to disclose additional details on the Corporation s allowance for loan losses: 

16 

The following tables denote the past due status of the Corporation's gross loans held for investment, net of fair value adjustments, at the dates indicated. 

(1)     All loans 90 days or greater past due are placed on non-accrual status. 

(1)     All loans 90 days or greater past due are placed on non-accrual status.

The following tables summarize the Corporation s allowance for loan losses and recorded investment in gross loans, by portfolio type, at the dates and for the periods indicated.  

18 

The following tables identify the Corporation s total recorded investment in non-performing loans by type at the dates and for the periods indicated.  Generally, a loan is placed on non-accrual status when it becomes 90 days past due as to principal or interest or if the loan is deemed impaired, after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts, where the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of the contractual principal or interest on the loan is doubtful.  In addition, interest income is not recognized on any loan where management has determined that collection is not reasonably assured.  A non-performing loan may be restored to accrual status when delinquent principal and interest payments are brought current and future monthly principal and interest payments are expected to be collected on a timely basis.  Loans with a related allowance reserve have been individually evaluated for impairment using either a discounted cash flow analysis or, for collateral dependent loans, current appraisals less costs to sell, to establish realizable value.  This analysis may identify a specific impairment amount needed or may conclude that no reserve is needed.  Loans that are not individually evaluated for impairment are included in pools of homogeneous loans for evaluation of related allowance reserves. 
  
   19 

(1)     Consists of collectively and individually evaluated allowances, specifically assigned to the individual loan, and fair value credit adjustments. 
   (2)     There was no related allowance for loan losses because the loans have been charged-off to their fair value or the fair value of the collateral is higher than the loan balance.

   (2)     There was no related allowance for loan losses because the loans have been charged-off to their fair value or the fair value of the collateral is higher than the loan balance. 
    
  At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, there were no commitments to lend additional funds to those borrowers whose loans were classified as non-performing. 
    
  For the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Corporation s average recorded investment in non-performing loans was   $11.5 million   and   $15.3 million  , respectively.  The Corporation records payments on non-performing loans utilizing the cash basis or cost recovery method of accounting during the periods when the loans are on non-performing status.  For both quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, interest income of   $69,000   and   $101,000  , respectively, was recognized, based on cash receipts from loan payments on non-performing loans and   $67,000   and   $65,000  , respectively, was collected and applied to reduce the loan balances under the cost recovery method.  Foregone interest income, which would have been recorded had the non-performing loans been current in accordance with their original terms, amounted to   $39,000   and   $66,000   for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was not included in the results of operations.    

21 

The following table presents the average recorded investment in non-performing loans and the related interest income recognized for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

For the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were   no   loans that were newly modified from their original terms, re-underwritten or identified in the Corporation s asset quality reports as restructured loans.  During the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,   no   restructured loans were in default within a 12-month period subsequent to their original restructuring.  Additionally, during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were   no   loans whose modification was extended beyond the initial maturity of the modification.  At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, there were   no   commitments to lend additional funds to those borrowers whose loans were restructured. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation held   11   restructured loans with a net outstanding balance of   $3.7 million  : all were classified as substandard and non-accrual.  As of June 30, 2016, the Corporation held   13   restructured loans with a net outstanding balance of   $4.6 million  :    three   were classified as special mention on accrual status (  $1.3 million  ); and   10   were classified as substandard (  $3.3 million  , all on non-accrual status).  Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets that do not currently expose the Corporation to sufficient risk to warrant adverse classification but possess weaknesses are designated as special mention and are closely monitored by the Corporation.  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016,   $1.2 million   or   31%  , and   $1.9 million   or   41%  , respectively, of the restructured loans were current with respect to their modified payment terms. 
    
  The Corporation upgrades restructured single-family loans to the pass category if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments for at least six consecutive months; 12 months for those loans that were restructured more than once; and if the borrower has demonstrated satisfactory contractual payments beyond 12 consecutive months, the loan is no longer categorized as a restructured loan.  In addition to the payment history described above, multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans (which are sometimes referred to in this report as  preferred loans ) must also demonstrate a combination of the following characteristics to be upgraded: satisfactory cash flow, satisfactory guarantor support, and additional collateral support, among others. 
    
  To qualify for restructuring, a borrower must provide evidence of their creditworthiness such as, current financial statements, their most recent income tax returns, current paystubs, current W-2s, and most recent bank statements, among other documents, which are then verified by the Corporation.  The Corporation re-underwrites the loan with the borrower s updated financial information,  
  
   22 

new credit report, current loan balance, new interest rate, remaining loan term, updated property value and modified payment schedule, among other considerations, to determine if the borrower qualifies. 
    
  The following table summarizes at the dates indicated the restructured loan balances, net of allowance for loan losses, by loan type and non-accrual versus accrual status: 

The following tables identify the Corporation s total recorded investment in restructured loans by type at the dates and for the periods indicated. 

(1)     Consists of collectively and individually evaluated allowances, specifically assigned to the individual loan. 
   (2)     There was no related allowance for loan losses because the loans have been charged-off to their fair value or the fair value of the collateral is higher than the loan balance.

  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016,   three   properties were acquired in the settlement of loans, while   one   previously foreclosed upon property was sold.  This compares to the quarter ended September 30, 2015 when   two   properties were acquired in the settlement of loans, while   two   previously foreclosed upon properties were sold.  As of September 30, 2016, the net fair value of real estate owned was   $3.5 million  , comprised of   five   properties located in California and   one   property located in Arizona.  This compares to the real estate owned net fair value of   $2.7 million   at June 30, 2016, comprised of   three   properties located in California and   one   property located in Nevada.  A new appraisal was obtained on each of the properties at the time of foreclosure and fair value was derived by using the lower of the appraised value or the listing price of the property, net of selling costs.  Any initial loss was recorded as a charge to the allowance for loan losses before being transferred to real estate owned.  Subsequent to transfer to real estate owned, if there is further deterioration in real estate values, specific real estate owned loss reserves are established and charged to the statement of operations.  In addition, the Corporation records costs to carry real estate owned as real estate operating expenses as incurred. 

Note 7: Derivative and Other Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risks 
    
  The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of originating loans or providing funds under existing lines of credit, loan sale commitments to third parties and option contracts.  These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  The Corporation s exposure to credit loss, in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these financial instruments, is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments.  The Corporation uses the same credit policies in entering into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  As of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Corporation had commitments to extend credit (on loans to be held for investment and loans to be held for sale) of   $179.9 million   and   $191.7 million  , respectively. 

24 

The following table provides information at the dates indicated regarding undisbursed funds to borrowers on existing lines of credit with the Corporation as well as commitments to originate loans to be held for investment at the dates indicated below. 

The following table provides information regarding the allowance for loan losses for the undisbursed funds and commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for investment for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

In accordance with ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging,  and interpretations of the Derivatives Implementation Group of the FASB, the fair value of the commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale, loan sale commitments, to be announced ( TBA ) MBS trades, put option contracts and call option contracts are recorded at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  At September 30, 2016,   $2.6 million   was included in other assets and   $1.4 million   was included in other liabilities; at June 30, 2016,   $3.8 million   was included in other assets and   $3.2 million   was included in other liabilities.  The Corporation does not apply hedge accounting to its derivative financial instruments; therefore, all changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. 
    
  The net impact of derivative financial instruments on the gain on sale of loans contained in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was as follows: 

25 

The outstanding derivative financial instruments and other loan sale agreements at the dates indicated were as follows: 

Note 8: Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The Corporation adopted ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  and elected the fair value option pursuant to ASC 825,  Financial Instruments  on loans originated for sale by PBM.  ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  ASC 825 permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis (the  Fair Value Option ) at specified election dates.  At each subsequent reporting date, an entity is required to report unrealized gains and losses on items in earnings for which the fair value option has been elected.  The objective of the Fair Value Option is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. 
    
  The following table describes the difference at the dates indicated between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment at fair value and loans held for sale at fair value: 

ASC 820-10-65-4,  Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly,  provides additional guidance for estimating fair value in accordance with ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements,  when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased. 

26 

ASC 820 establishes a three-level valuation hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used in fair value calculations.  The three levels of inputs are defined as follows: 
                   Level 1 
    - 
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Corporation has the ability to access at the measurement date. 
    
      Level 2 
    - 
    Observable inputs other than Level 1 such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated to observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
    
      Level 3 
    - 
    Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that use significant assumptions, including assumptions of risks.  These unobservable assumptions reflect the Corporation s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  Valuation techniques include the use of pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 

ASC 820 requires the Corporation to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  If a financial instrument uses inputs that fall in different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument will be categorized based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value calculation. 
    
  The Corporation s financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of investment securities available for sale, loans held for investment at fair value, loans held for sale at fair value, interest-only strips and derivative financial instruments; while non-performing loans, mortgage servicing assets ("MSA") and real estate owned are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. 
    
  Investment securities - available for sale are primarily comprised of U.S. government agency MBS and U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS.  The Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active and less than active markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement of MBS and debt securities (Level 2) and broker price indications for similar securities in non-active markets for its fair value measurement of the CMO (Level 3). 
    
  Derivative financial instruments are comprised of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale, mandatory loan sale commitments, TBA MBS trades and option contracts.  The fair value of TBA MBS trades is determined using quoted secondary-market prices (Level 2).  The fair values of other derivative financial instruments are determined by quoted prices for a similar commitment or commitments, adjusted for the specific attributes of each commitment (Level 3). 
    
  Loans held for investment at fair value are primarily single-family loans which have been transferred from loans held for sale.  The fair value is determined by the quoted secondary-market prices which account for interest rate characteristics, which are adjusted for management estimates of the specific credit risk attributes of each loan (Level 3). 
    
  Loans held for sale at fair value are primarily single-family loans.  The fair value is determined, when possible, using quoted secondary-market prices such as mandatory loan sale commitments.  If no such quoted price exists, the fair value of a loan is determined by quoted prices for a similar loan or loans, adjusted for the specific attributes of each loan (Level 2). 
    
  Non-performing loans are loans which are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the borrowers or of the collateral pledged.  The non-performing loans are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Corporation will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  The fair value of a non-performing loan is determined based on an observable market price or current appraised value of the underlying collateral.  Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, and/or management s expertise and knowledge of the borrower.  For non-performing loans which are restructured loans, the fair value is derived from discounted cash flow analysis (Level 3), except those which are in the process of foreclosure or 90 days delinquent for which the fair value is derived from the appraised value of its collateral (Level 2).  For other non-performing loans which are not restructured loans, other than non-performing commercial real estate loans, the fair value is derived from relative value analysis: historical experience and management estimates by loan type for which collectively evaluated allowances are assigned (Level 3); or the appraised value of its collateral for loans which are in the process of foreclosure or where borrowers file bankruptcy (Level 2).  For non-performing commercial real estate loans, the fair value is derived from the appraised value of its collateral (Level 2).  Non-performing loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional allowance and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors identified above.  This loss is not recorded directly as an adjustment to current earnings or other comprehensive income (loss), but rather as a component in determining the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.  These adjustments to the estimated fair value of non-performing loans may result in increases or decreases to the provision for loan losses recorded in current earnings. 
  
   27 

The Corporation uses the amortization method for its MSA, which amortizes the MSA in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income and assesses the MSA for impairment based on fair value at each reporting date.  The fair value of MSA is derived using the present value method; which includes a third party s prepayment projections of similar instruments, weighted-average coupon rates and the estimated average life (Level 3). 
    
  The rights to future income from serviced loans that exceed contractually specified servicing fees are recorded as interest-only strips.  The fair value of interest-only strips is derived using the same assumptions that are used to value the related MSA (Level 3). 
    
  The fair value of real estate owned is derived from the lower of the appraised value or the listing price, net of estimated selling costs (Level 2). 
    
  The Corporation s valuation methodologies may produce a fair value calculation that may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values.  While management believes the Corporation s valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date. 
    
  The following fair value hierarchy tables present information at the dates indicated about the Corporation s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

The following tables summarize reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances during the periods shown of recurring fair value measurements recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition using Level 3 inputs: 

(1)   
    The valuation of loans held for investment at fair value includes the management estimates of the specific credit risk attributes of each loan (Level 3), in addition to the quoted secondary-market prices which account for interest rate characteristics. 
               (2)   
    Consists of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale. 
               (3)

The following table presents additional information about valuation techniques and inputs used for assets and liabilities, including derivative financial instruments, which are measured at fair value and categorized within Level 3 as of September 30, 2016: 

(1)   
    The range is based on the estimated fair values and management estimates. 
               (2)   
    Unless otherwise noted, this column represents the directional change in the fair value of the Level 3 investments that would result from an increase to the corresponding unobservable input. A decrease to the unobservable input would have the opposite effect. Significant changes in these inputs in isolation could result in significantly higher or lower fair value measurements.  
               (3)   
    The percentage of commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale which management has estimated may not fund. 
               (4)   
    An estimated cost to roll forward the mandatory loan sale commitments which management has estimated may not be delivered to the corresponding investors in a timely manner. 
       
  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Corporation s assets and liabilities include the following: prepayment speeds, discount rates, MBS   TBA quotes, fallout ratios, broker quotes and roll-forward costs, among  
  
   32 

others.  Significant increases or decreases in any of these inputs in isolation could result in significantly lower or higher fair value measurement. The various unobservable inputs used to determine valuations may have similar or diverging impacts on valuation. 
    
  The carrying amount and fair value of the Corporation s other financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 was as follows: 

Loans held for investment, not recorded at fair value: For loans that reprice frequently at market rates, the carrying amount approximates the fair value.  For fixed-rate loans, the fair value is determined by either (i) discounting the estimated future cash flows of such loans over their estimated remaining contractual maturities using a current interest rate at which such loans would be made to borrowers, or (ii) quoted market prices. The allowance for loan losses is subtracted as an estimate of the underlying credit risk. 
    
  Investment securities - held to maturity:  The investment securities - held to maturity consist of time deposits at CRA qualified minority financial institutions and U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS.  Due to the short-term nature of the time deposits, the principal balance approximated fair value (Level 2).  For the MBS, the Corporation utilizes quoted prices in active and less than active markets for similar securities for its fair value measurement of MBS and debt securities (Level 2). 
    
  FHLB   San Francisco stock: The carrying amount reported for FHLB   San Francisco stock approximates fair value. When redeemed, the Corporation will receive an amount equal to the par value of the stock. 
    
  Deposits: The fair value of time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation. The discount rate is based upon rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities.  The fair value of transaction accounts (checking, money market and savings accounts) is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation and management estimates of current market conditions. 
    
  Borrowings: The fair value of borrowings has been estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation.  The discount rate on such borrowings is based upon rates currently offered for borrowings of similar remaining maturities. 
    
  The Corporation has various processes and controls in place to ensure that fair value is reasonably estimated.  The Corporation generally determines fair value of their Level 3 assets and liabilities by using internally developed models which primarily utilize discounted cash flow techniques and prices obtained from independent management services or brokers.  The Corporation performs  
  
   33 

due diligence procedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to support their use in the valuation process.  The fair values of investment securities, commitments to extend credit on loans held for sale, mandatory commitments and option contracts are determined from the independent management services or brokers; while the fair value of MSA and interest-only strips are determined using the internally developed models which are based on discounted cash flow analysis.  The fair value of non-performing loans is determined by calculating discounted cash flows, relative value analysis or collateral value, less selling costs. 
    
  While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no significant changes to the Corporation s valuation techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

Note 9: Reclassification adjustment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income ("AOCI") 
    
  The following tables provide the changes in AOCI by component for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

There were   no   significant items reclassified out of AOCI for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Note 10: Offsetting Derivative and Other Financial Instruments 
    
  The Corporation s derivative transactions are generally governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association Master Agreements and similar arrangements, which include provisions governing the setoff of assets and liabilities between the parties.  When the Corporation has more than one outstanding derivative transaction with a single counterparty, the setoff provisions contained within these agreements generally allow the non-defaulting party the right to reduce its liability to the defaulting party by amounts eligible for setoff, including the collateral received as well as eligible offsetting transactions with that counterparty, irrespective of the currency, place of payment, or booking office.  The Corporation s policy is to present its derivative assets and derivative liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition on a net basis for each type of derivative.  The derivative assets and liabilities are comprised of mandatory loan sale commitments, TBA MBS trades and option contracts. 
    
  The following tables present the gross and net amounts of derivative assets and liabilities and other financial instruments as reported in the Corporation s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition, and the gross amount not offset in the Corporation s Condensed Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of the dates indicated.

ITEM 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

General 
    
  Provident Financial Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was organized in January 1996 for the purpose of becoming the holding company of Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B. ("the Bank") upon the Bank s conversion from a federal mutual to a federal stock savings bank ( Conversion ).  The Conversion was completed on June 27, 1996.  The Corporation is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ).  At September 30, 2016, the Corporation had total assets of $1.24 billion, total deposits of $943.5 million and total stockholders  equity of $133.2 million.  The Corporation has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank.  Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiaries.  As used in this report, the terms  we,   our,   us,  and  Corporation  refer to Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
    
  The Bank, founded in 1956, is a federally chartered stock savings bank headquartered in Riverside, California.  The Bank is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ), its primary federal regulator, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ), the insurer of its deposits.  The Bank s deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC.  The Bank has been a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System since 1956. 

36 

The Corporation s business consists of community banking activities and mortgage banking activities, conducted by Provident Bank and Provident Bank Mortgage ("PBM"),  a division of the Bank.  Community banking activities primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding the Bank s full service offices and investing those funds in single-family loans, multi-family loans, commercial real estate loans, construction loans, commercial business loans, consumer loans and other real estate loans.  The Bank also offers business checking accounts, other business banking services, and services loans for others.  Mortgage banking activities consist of the origination, purchase and sale of mortgage loans secured primarily by single-family residences.  The Bank currently operates 14 retail/business banking offices in Riverside County and San Bernardino County (commonly known as the Inland Empire).  Provident Bank Mortgage operates two wholesale loan production offices: one in Pleasanton and one in Rancho Cucamonga, California; and 14 retail loan production offices located throughout California.  The Corporation s revenues are derived principally from interest on its loans and investment securities and fees generated through its community banking and mortgage banking activities.  There are various risks inherent in the Corporation s business including, among others, the general business environment, interest rates, the California real estate market, the demand for loans, the prepayment of loans, the repurchase of loans previously sold to investors, the secondary market conditions to sell loans, competitive conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, fraud and other risks. 
    
  The Corporation began to distribute quarterly cash dividends in the quarter ended December 31, 2002.  On July 25, 2016, the Corporation declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share for the Corporation s shareholders of record at the close of business on August 15, 2016, which was paid on September 5, 2016.  Future declarations or payments of dividends will be subject to the consideration of the Corporation s Board of Directors, which will take into account the Corporation s financial condition, results of operations, tax considerations, capital requirements, industry standards, legal restrictions, economic conditions and other factors, including the regulatory restrictions which affect the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Corporation.  Under Delaware law, dividends may be paid either out of surplus or, if there is no surplus, out of net profits for the current fiscal year and/or the preceding fiscal year in which the dividend is declared.  For further discussion, see Note 11 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the Corporation.  The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying selected Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The discussion and analysis of the Corporation s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Corporation s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
    
  The Corporation's critical accounting policies are described in the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K ended June 30, 2016 in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies.  There have been no significant changes to the critical accounting policies as described in the Corporation's 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended June 30, 2016.  

Executive Summary and Operating Strategy 
    
  Provident Savings Bank, F.S.B., established in 1956, is a financial services company committed to serving consumers and small to mid-sized businesses in the Inland Empire region of Southern California.  The Bank conducts its business operations as Provident Bank, Provident Bank Mortgage, a division of the Bank, and through its subsidiary, Provident Financial Corp.  The business activities of the Corporation, primarily through the Bank and its subsidiary, consist of community banking, mortgage banking and, to a lesser degree, investment services for customers and trustee services on behalf of the Bank. 
    
  Community banking operations primarily consist of accepting deposits from customers within the communities surrounding the Corporation s full service offices and investing those funds in single-family, multi-family and commercial real estate loans.  Also, to a lesser extent, the Corporation makes construction, commercial business, consumer and other mortgage loans.  The primary source of income in community banking is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income earned on loans and investment securities, and the interest expense paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds.  Additionally, certain fees are collected from depositors, such as returned check fees, deposit account service charges, ATM fees, IRA/KEOGH fees, safe deposit box fees, travelers check fees, wire transfer fees and overdraft protection fees, among others. 
    
  During the next three years, subject to market conditions, the Corporation intends to improve its community banking business by moderately growing total assets; by decreasing the concentration of single-family mortgage loans within loans held for investment; and by increasing the concentration of higher yielding preferred loans (i.e., multi-family, commercial real estate, construction and commercial business loans).  In addition, the Corporation intends to decrease the percentage of time deposits in its deposit base  
  
   38 

and to increase the percentage of lower cost checking and savings accounts.  This strategy is intended to improve core revenue through a higher net interest margin and ultimately, coupled with the growth of the Corporation, an increase in net interest income.  While the Corporation s long-term strategy is for moderate growth, management recognizes that growth may not occur as a result of weaknesses in general economic conditions. 
    
  Mortgage banking operations primarily consist of the origination, purchase and sale of mortgage loans secured by single-family residences.  The primary sources of income in mortgage banking are gain on sale of loans and certain fees collected from borrowers in connection with the loan origination process.  The Corporation will continue to modify its operations, including the number of mortgage banking personnel, in response to the rapidly changing mortgage banking environment.  Changes may include a different product mix, further tightening of underwriting standards, variations in its operating expenses or a combination of these and other changes. 
    
  Provident Financial Corp performs trustee services for the Bank s real estate secured loan transactions and has in the past held, and may in the future hold, real estate for investment.  Investment services operations primarily consist of selling alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds to the Bank s depositors.  Investment services and trustee services contribute a very small percentage of gross revenue. 
    
  There are a number of risks associated with the business activities of the Corporation, many of which are beyond the Corporation s control, including: changes in accounting principles, laws, regulation, interest rates and the economy, among others.  The Corporation attempts to mitigate many of these risks through prudent banking practices, such as interest rate risk management, credit risk management, operational risk management, and liquidity risk management.  The California economic environment presents heightened risk for the Corporation primarily with respect to real estate values and loan delinquencies. Since the majority of the Corporation s loans are secured by real estate located within California, significant declines in the value of California real estate may also inhibit the Corporation s ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate.  In addition, the Corporation s operating costs may increase significantly as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act.   Many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the Corporation. 

Off-Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements and Contractual Obligations 
    
  Commitments and Derivative Financial Instruments.    The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, in the form of originating loans or providing funds under existing lines of credit, loan sale agreements to third parties and option contracts.  These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest-rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.  The Corporation s exposure to credit loss, in the event of non-performance by the counterparty to these financial instruments, is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments.  The Corporation uses the same credit policies in entering into financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  For a discussion on commitments and derivative financial instruments, see Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

39 

Contractual Obligations.    The following table summarizes the Corporation s contractual obligations at September 30, 2016 and the effect these obligations are expected to have on the Corporation s liquidity and cash flows in future periods: 

(1)   
    Represents the potential future obligation for loans previously sold by the Bank to the FHLB   San Francisco under its Mortgage Partnership Finance ( MPF ) program.  As of September 30, 2016, the Bank serviced $19.0 million of loans under this program.  The estimated amounts by period are based on historical loss experience. 
       
  The expected obligation for time deposits and FHLB   San Francisco advances include anticipated interest accruals based on the respective contractual terms. 
    
  In addition to the off-balance sheet financing arrangements and contractual obligations mentioned above, the Corporation has derivatives and other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risks as described in Note 7 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 
    
  Total assets increased $71.1 million, or six percent, to $1.24 billion at September 30, 2016 from $1.17 billion at June 30, 2016.  The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in loans held for sale and loans held for investment, partly offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents. 
    
  Total cash and cash equivalents, primarily excess cash deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, decreased $11.8 million, or 23 percent, to $39.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $51.2 million at June 30, 2016.  The decrease in the total cash and cash equivalents was primarily attributable to the deployment of excess cash to fund loans held for sale and loans held for investment. 
    
  Total investment securities decreased $4.4 million, or nine percent, to $47.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $51.5 million at June 30, 2016.  The decrease was primarily due to scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed securities.  For further analysis on investment securities, see Note 5 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Loans held for investment increased $14.0 million, or two percent, to $854.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $840.0 million at June 30, 2016.  During the first three months of fiscal 2017, the Corporation originated $35.3 million of loans held for investment, consisting primarily of single-family and multi-family loans.  During the first three months of fiscal 2017, the Corporation also purchased $23.0 million of loans to be held for investment, primarily multi-family loans.  Total loan principal payments during the first three months of fiscal 2017 were $50.5 million, up 10 percent from $45.8 million during the comparable period in fiscal 2016, due primarily to higher loan refinance activity.  In addition, real estate owned acquired in the settlement of loans in the first three months of fiscal 2017 and 2016 was $1.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively.  The balance of preferred loans increased $25.3 million, or five percent, to $544.5 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $519.2 million at June 30, 2016, net of undisbursed loan funds of $10.4 million and $11.3 million, respectively, and represented 63 percent and 61 percent of loans held for investment, respectively.  The balance of single-family loans held for investment decreased $11.7 million, or four percent, to $312.8 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $324.5 million at June 30, 2016, and represented approximately 36 percent and 38 percent of loans held for investment, respectively.  The change in the mix between the preferred loans and single-family loans was consistent with the Corporation s strategy to increase the average loan yield.

The tables below describe the geographic dispersion of gross real estate secured loans held for investment at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, as a percentage of the total dollar amount outstanding: 
    
  As of September 30, 2016 

(1)   
    Other than the Inland Empire. 
       
  As of June 30, 2016 

(1)   
    Other than the Inland Empire. 
       
  Loans held for sale increased $74.9 million, or 40 percent, to $264.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $189.5 million at June 30, 2016.  The increase was primarily due to the higher volume of loans originated and purchased for sale, $647.3 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $557.2 million during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and the timing difference between loan fundings and loan sale settlements. 
    
  Total deposits increased by $17.1 million, or two percent, to $943.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $926.4 million at June 30, 2016.  Transaction accounts increased $24.1 million, or four percent, to $641.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $617.5 million at June 30, 2016, while time deposits decreased $7.0 million, or two percent, to $301.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $308.9 million at June 30, 2016.   The change in deposit mix was consistent with the Corporation s marketing strategy to promote transaction accounts and the strategic decision to increase  the percentage of lower cost transaction accounts in its deposit base and decrease the percentage of time deposits by competing less aggressively for time deposits. 
    
  Total borrowings increased $55.0 million to $146.3 million, or 60 percent, at September 30, 2016 as compared to $91.3 million at June 30, 2016, primarily due to borrowing short-term FHLB advances to fund increased mortgage banking activity. 
    
  Total stockholders  equity decreased $228,000 to $133.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $133.5 million at June 30, 2016, primarily as a result of stock repurchases totaling $1.7 million (see Part II, Item 2,  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds ) and $1.0 million of quarterly cash dividends paid, partly offset by net income of $1.6 million during the first three months of fiscal 2017. 

41 

Comparison of Operating Results for the Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 
    
  The Corporation s net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.6 million, a decrease of $849,000, or 35 percent, as compared to the same period of fiscal 2016.  The decrease in net income for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was primarily attributable to a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in non-interest expense, partly offset by an increase in net interest income, compared to the same period one year ago. 
    
  The Corporation s efficiency ratio, defined as non-interest expense divided by the sum of net interest income and non-interest income, deteriorated to 85 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 78 percent for the same period of fiscal 2016.  Return on average assets declined 30 basis points to 0.53 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 0.83 percent in the same period last year; and return on average equity decreased to 4.79 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 6.96 percent in the same period last year. 
    
  Diluted earnings per share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were $0.20, a 29 percent decrease from $0.28 in the same period last year.  The lower percentage decrease in the diluted earnings per share in comparison to the percentage decrease in the net income was primarily attributable to stock repurchases during the last 12 months.   
    
  Net Interest Income: 
    
  For the Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    Net interest income increased $1.0 million, or 12 percent, to $9.1 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $8.1 million for the comparable period in fiscal 2016, due to a higher net interest margin and a higher average earning asset balance.  The net interest margin was 3.08 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, a 26 basis points increase from 2.82 percent in the same period of fiscal 2016, primarily due to an increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets and a decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities.  The weighted-average yield on interest-earning assets increased by 22 basis points to 3.67 percent from 3.45 percent in the same quarter last year, while the weighted-average cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased by six basis points to 0.64 percent for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to 0.70 percent in  the same quarter last year.  The increase in the average yield of interest-earning assets was primarily due to the utilization of interest-earning deposits earning a nominal yield to fund higher balances of loans receivable and investment securities, which earned a significantly higher yield.  The average balance of interest-earning assets increased $35.9 million, or three percent, to $1.18 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $1.14 billion in the comparable period of fiscal 2016, primarily reflecting increases in average loans receivable and investment securities, partly offset by a decrease in average interest-earning deposits.  The decrease in average interest-earning deposits was primarily due to the deployment of excess cash to fund loans held for sale and loans held for investment.     
    
  Interest Income: 
    
  For the Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    Total interest income increased by $947,000, or 10 percent, to $10.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $9.9 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  This increase was primarily due to the higher average balance of loans receivable. 
    
  Interest income on loans receivable increased $990,000, or 10 percent, to $10.5 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $9.5 million for the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  This increase was attributable to a higher average loan balance, partly offset by a lower average loan yield.  The average balance of loans receivable, including loans held for sale, increased by $115.4 million, or 12 percent, to $1.08 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $962.6 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  The average balance of loans held for sale increased $80.3 million, or 53 percent, to $231.1 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $150.8 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  The average yield on the loans held for sale decreased by 27 basis points to 3.59 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 3.86 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  The average loan yield, including loans held for sale, during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 decreased five basis points to 3.89 percent from 3.94 percent during the same quarter last year, primarily due to the decrease in the average yield of loans held for sale.  
    
  Interest income from investment securities increased $17,000, or 25 percent, to $84,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $67,000 for the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  This increase was attributable to a higher average balance, partly offset by a lower average yield.  The average balance of investment securities increased $35.0 million, or 240 percent, to $49.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $14.6 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  The increase in average balance of investment securities was primarily the result of purchases of mortgage-backed securities during fiscal 2016, partly offset by scheduled and accelerated principal payments on mortgage-backed securities.  The average investment securities yield decreased 115 basis points to 0.68% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 1.83% in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  The decrease in the average investment securities yield was primarily attributable to the purchases of investment securities which had lower average yields than the existing portfolio and accelerated amortization of purchase premiums resulting from accelerated principal payments. 
  
   42 

The FHLB   San Francisco cash dividend received in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $185,000, down eight percent from $200,000 in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  The average yield decreased 74 basis points to 9.14% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 9.88% in the comparable quarter last year. 
    
  Interest income from interest-earning deposits, primarily cash deposited at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, was $55,000 in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, down 45 percent from $100,000 in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  The decrease was due to a lower average balance, partly offset by a higher average yield in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, as compared to the same quarter last year.  The average balance of the interest-earning deposits in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $43.3 million, a decrease of $114.5 million or 73 percent, from $157.8 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  The decrease in interest-earning deposits was primarily due to the deployment of excess cash to fund the increase in loans held for sale and loans held for investment, consistent with the Corporation s interest rate risk management strategy.  The average yield increased 25 basis points to 0.50% in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 0.25% in the comparable quarter last year, due primarily to the increase in the federal funds rate from 0.25% to 0.50% effective December 17, 2015.    
    
  Interest Expense: 
    
  For the Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    Total interest expense for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.7 million as compared to $1.8 million for the same period last year, a decrease of $75,000, or four percent.  This decrease was attributable to a lower average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, partly offset by a higher average balance of interest-bearing liabilities. 
    
  Interest expense on deposits for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1.0 million as compared to $1.1 million for the same period last year, a decrease of $129,000, or 11 percent.  The decrease in interest expense on deposits was primarily attributable to a lower average cost of deposits, partly offset by a slightly higher average balance.  The average cost of deposits decreased six basis points to 0.43 percent during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from 0.49 percent during the same quarter last year.  The decrease in the average cost of deposits was attributable primarily to a lower average cost of transaction accounts and a lower percentage of time deposits to the total deposit balance.  The average balance of deposits increased $6.3 million, or one percent, to $932.8 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $926.5 million during the same period last year.  The increase in the average balance was primarily attributable to an increase in transaction accounts, partly offset by a decrease in time deposits.  Strategically, the Corporation has been promoting transaction accounts and competing less aggressively for time deposits.  The Corporation believes the increase in transaction accounts was also attributable to the impact of depositors seeking an alternative to lower yielding time deposits in light of the current low interest rate environment.  The average balance of transaction accounts to total deposits in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 67 percent, compared to 63 percent in the same period of fiscal 2016. 
    
  Interest expense on borrowings, consisting of FHLB   San Francisco advances, for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased $54,000, or eight percent, to $702,000 from $648,000 for the same period last year.  The increase in interest expense on borrowings was the result of a higher average balance, partly offset by a lower average cost.  The average balance of borrowings increased $35.5 million, or 39 percent, to $126.9 million during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $91.4 million during the same period last year.  The average cost of borrowings decreased 62 basis points to 2.19 percent for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from 2.81 percent in the same quarter last year.  The decrease in average cost of advances was primarily due to the increased utilization of overnight borrowings and short-term advances with a much lower average cost than long-term FHLB advances.

Recovery from the Allowance for Loan Losses: 
    
  For the Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Corporation recorded a recovery from the allowance for loan losses of $150,000, a 295 percent increase from the $38,000 recovery from the allowance for loan losses in the same period of fiscal 2016.  The increase in the recovery was primarily attributable to further improvement in credit quality, partly offset by an increase of the outstanding balance of loans held for investment.  Non-performing loans decreased $296,000, or three percent, to $10.0 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $10.3 million at June 30, 2016 and were $14.8 million at September 30, 2015.  Net recoveries in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 were $205,000 or 0.08 percent (annualized) of average loans receivable, compared to net recoveries of $348,000 or 0.14 percent (annualized) of average loans receivable in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.  Total classified loans, consisting of special mention and substandard loans, were $18.9 million at September 30, 2016 as compared to $19.2 million at June 30, 2016 and to $25.6 million at September 30, 2015. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses was determined through quantitative and qualitative adjustments including the Bank's charge-off experience and reflects the impact on loans held for investment from the current general economic conditions of the U.S. and California economies such as the improving unemployment rate and higher home prices in California.  See related discussion of  Asset Quality  below. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses was $8.7 million, comprised of collectively evaluated allowances of $8.7 million and individually evaluated allowances of $20,000; in comparison to the allowance for loan losses of $8.7 million at June 30, 2016, comprised of collectively evaluated allowances of $8.7 million and individually evaluated allowances of $20,000.  The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans held for investment was 1.01 percent at September 30, 2016 compared to 1.02 percent at June 30, 2016.  Management considers, based on currently available information, the allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb potential losses inherent in loans held for investment.  For further analysis on the allowance for loan losses, see Note 6 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 

45 

Non-Interest Income: 
    
  For the Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    Total non-interest income decreased $1.2 million, or 11 percent, to $9.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $10.5 million for the same period last year.  The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the net gain on sale of loans and losses on the sale and operations of real estate owned during the current quarter as compared to the comparable period last year. 
    
  The net gain on sale of loans decreased $928,000, or 10 percent, to $8.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $8.9 million in the same quarter of fiscal 2016 reflecting the impact of a lower average loan sale margin, partly offset by a higher loan sale volume.  The average loan sale margin for PBM decreased to 1.25 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, down 40 basis points from 1.65 percent in the same period of fiscal 2016.  The decrease in the average loan sale margin for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to volatility in loan servicing premiums in the cash markets.  Additionally, product composition was less favorable with a higher percentage of loan sales comprised of lower margin products.  Refinance transactions rose as a percentage of total volume, particularly from the wholesale channel, and volume also consisted of higher percentage of conventional high balance product.  Total loan sale volume, which includes the net change in commitments to extend credit on loans to be held for sale, increased $100.7 million or 19 percent to $640.3 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 from $539.6 million in the comparable quarter last year.  The increase in loan sale volume was attributable to the increase in the refinance market as compared to the same period last year.  The total refinance loans as percentage of total loans originated by PBM during the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was 58 percent, up from 43 percent in the same quarter of fiscal 2016.   The gain on sale of loans includes a favorable fair-value adjustment on loans held for sale and derivative financial instruments (commitments to extend credit, commitments to sell loans, commitments to sell mortgage-backed securities, and option contracts) pursuant to ASC 815 and ASC 825 that amounted to a net gain of $2.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 as compared to an unfavorable fair-value adjustment net loss of $345,000 in the same period last year.  The fair-value adjustment on loans held for sale and derivative financial instruments is consistent with the Bank's mortgage banking activity and the volatility of mortgage interest rates.  As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of derivative financial instruments pursuant to ASC 815 and ASC 825 was $10.8 million, compared to $8.7 million at June 30, 2016 and $7.6 million at September 30, 2015.   
    
  Non-Interest Expense: 
    
  For the Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    Total non-interest expense in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was $15.6 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or eight percent, as compared to $14.4 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in non-interest expense was primarily due to increases in salaries and employee benefits, premises and occupancy expenses and other operating expenses primarily related to mortgage banking operations. 
    
  Total salaries and employee benefits expense increased $522,000, or five percent, to $11.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $10.8 million in the same period of fiscal 2016.  The increase was primarily attributable to higher incentive compensation costs related to higher loan originations.  Total loan originations and purchases (including loans originated and purchased for investment and loans originated and purchased for sale) increased $130.1 million, or 23 percent, to $705.6 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 from $575.5 million in the comparable quarter in fiscal 2016. 
    
  Provision for Income Taxes: 
    
  The income tax provision reflects accruals for taxes at the applicable rates for federal income tax and California franchise tax based upon reported pre-tax income, adjusted for the effect of all permanent differences between income for tax and financial reporting purposes, such as non-deductible stock-based compensation, bank-owned life insurance policies and certain California tax-exempt loans, among others.  Therefore, there are fluctuations in the effective income tax rate from period to period based on the relationship of net permanent differences to income before tax. 
    
  For the Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    The income tax provision was $1.3 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $1.8 million for the same quarter last year.  The effective income tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was 44.2 percent as compared to 41.7 percent in the same quarter last year.  The increase in the effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 was due primarily to lower tax benefits related to deferred compensation, as compared to the same quarter last year.  The Corporation believes that the effective income tax rate applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 reflects its current income tax obligations.

Asset Quality 
    
  Non-performing loans, net of the allowance for loan losses and fair value adjustments, consisting of loans with collateral primarily located in California, decreased $296,000, or three percent, to $10.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $10.3 million at June 30, 2016.  Non-performing loans as a percentage of loans held for investment improved to 1.17 percent at September 30, 2016 from 1.23 percent at June 30, 2016.  The non-performing loans at September 30, 2016 were primarily comprised of 34 single-family loans ($9.2 million); two multi-family loans ($703,000); one commercial business loan ($74,000); and one consumer loan (fully reserved).  This compares to the $10.3 million of non-performing loans at June 30, 2016 which were primarily comprised of 35 single-family loans ($9.5 million); two multi-family loans ($709,000); one commercial business loan ($76,000); and one consumer loan (fully reserved).  No interest accruals were made for loans that were past due 90 days or more or if the loans were deemed non-performing. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, total restructured loans decreased $874,000, or 19 percent, to $3.7 million from $4.6 million at June 30, 2016.  At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, $3.7 million and $3.3 million, respectively, of these restructured loans were classified as non-performing.  As of September 30, 2016, $1.2 million, or 31 percent, of the restructured loans have a current payment status, consistent with their modified payment terms; this compares to $1.9 million, or 41 percent, of restructured loans that had a current payment status, consistent with their modified payment terms as of June 30, 2016. 
    
  Real estate owned was $3.5 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $790,000 or 29 percent from $2.7 million at June 30, 2016.  Real estate owned at September 30, 2016 was comprised of six single-family properties, five of which are located in California and one is located in Arizona.  The Corporation has not suspended foreclosure activity at any time through the most recent credit cycle because, to date, the Corporation has not been in a situation where its foreclosure documentation, process or legal standing has been challenged by a court.  The Corporation maintains the original promissory note and deed of trust for loans held for investment.  As a result, the Corporation does not rely on lost-note affidavits to fulfill foreclosure filing requirements. 
    
  Non-performing assets, which includes non-performing loans and real estate owned, decreased $494,000, or four percent, to $13.5 million or 1.09 percent of total assets at September 30, 2016 from $13.0 million or 1.11 percent of total assets at June 30, 2016.  Restructured loans which are performing in accordance with their modified terms and are not otherwise classified non-accrual are not included in non-performing assets.  For further analysis on non-performing loans and restructured loans, see Note 6 of the Notes to Unaudited Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Occasionally, the Corporation is required to repurchase loans sold to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or other institutional investors if it is determined that such loans do not meet the credit requirements of the investor, or if one of the parties involved in the loan misrepresented pertinent facts, committed fraud, or if such loans were 90-days past due within 120 days of the loan funding date.  During the first three months of fiscal 2017, the Corporation repurchased one loan of $389,000 from an investor pursuant to the recourse/repurchase covenants contained in the loan sale agreement, which was subsequently paid off.  This compares to the first three months of fiscal 2016 when the Corporation repurchased four loans, totaling $1.2 million, from investors pursuant to the recourse/repurchase covenants contained in the loan sale agreements, while additional repurchase requests were settled that did not result in the repurchase of the loan itself.  The primary reasons for honoring the repurchase requests are borrower fraud, undisclosed liabilities on borrower applications, and documentation, verification and appraisal disputes.  For the first three months of fiscal 2017, the Corporation did not record a recourse provision and did not settle any claims.  This compares to the first three months of fiscal 2016 when the Corporation had a recourse provision of $3,000 and settled claims for $3,000.  As of September 30, 2016, the total recourse reserve for loans sold that are subject to repurchase was $453,000, unchanged from June 30, 2016 and down from $768,000 at September 30, 2015. 
     
  Beginning in 2008, in connection with the down turn in the real estate market, the Corporation implemented tighter underwriting standards to reduce potential loan repurchase requests, including requiring higher credit scores, generally lower debt-to-income ratios, and verification of income and assets, among other criteria.  Despite management s diligent estimate of the recourse reserve, the Corporation is still subject to risks and uncertainties associated with potentially higher loan repurchase claims from investors, and there are no assurances that the current recourse reserve will be sufficient to cover all future recourse claims.

The following table shows the summary of the recourse liability for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

A decline in real estate values subsequent to the time of origination of the Corporation s real estate secured loans could result in higher loan delinquency levels, foreclosures, provisions for loan losses and net charge-offs.  Real estate values and real estate markets are beyond the Corporation s control and are generally affected by changes in national, regional or local economic conditions and other factors.  These factors include fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies and acts of nature, such as earthquakes and national disasters particular to California where substantially all of the Corporation s real estate collateral is located.  If real estate values decline from the levels described in the following tables (which were derived at the time of loan origination), the value of the real estate collateral securing the Corporation s loans as set forth in the table could be significantly overstated.  The Corporation s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and it would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans.  The Corporation generally does not update the loan-to-value ratio ( LTV ) on its loans held for investment by obtaining new appraisals or broker price opinions (nor does the Corporation intend to do so in the future as a result of the costs and inefficiencies associated with completing the task) unless a specific loan has demonstrated deterioration or the Corporation receives a loan modification request from a borrower (in which case individually evaluated allowances are established, if required).  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the LTV ratios disclosed in the following tables may be understated or overstated in comparison to their current LTV ratios as a result of their year of origination, the subsequent general decline or improvement in real estate values that occurred and the specific location of the individual properties.  The Corporation has not quantified the current LTVs of its loans held for investment nor the impact the decline in real estate values has had on the original LTVs of its loans held for investment.

(2)   
    Based on borrower's FICO scores at the time of loan origination.  The FICO score represents the creditworthiness of a borrower based on the borrower s credit history, as reported by an independent third party.  A higher FICO score indicates a greater degree of creditworthiness.  Bank regulators have issued guidance stating that a FICO score of 660 and below is indicative of a  subprime  borrower. 
               (3)   
    LTV is the ratio derived by dividing the current loan balance by the lower of the original appraised value or purchase price of the real estate collateral.

  The reset of payment terms on adjustable rate mortgage loans (primarily interest only single-family loans) to a fully amortizing status from their interest-only period has started to accelerate and may create a payment shock for some of the Corporation s borrowers as the loans reprice to a higher monthly payment consisting of both principal and interest, which may result in an increase in non-performing loans.  To date, the Corporation has not experienced an elevated level of delinquencies or defaults related to payment shocks.

(4)   
    Includes net changes in undisbursed loan funds, deferred loan fees or costs, allowance for loan losses, fair vale of loans held for investment, fair value of loans held for sale, advance payments of escrows and repurchases. 
       
  Loans that the Corporation has originated for sale are primarily sold on a servicing released basis.  Clear ownership is conveyed to the investor by endorsing the original note in favor of the investor; transferring the servicing to a new servicer consistent with investor instructions; communicating the servicing transfer to the borrower as required by law; and sending the loan file and collateral instruments electronically to the investor contemporaneous with receiving the cash proceeds from the sale of the loan.  Additionally, the Corporation registers the change of ownership in the mortgage electronic registration system known as MERS as required by the contractual terms of the loan sale agreement.  The Corporation does not believe that completing this  
  
   55 

additional registration clouds ownership of the note since the steps previously described have also been taken.  Also, the Corporation retains an imaged copy of the entire loan file and collateral instruments as an abundance of caution in the event questions arise that can only be answered by reviewing the loan file.  Additionally, the Corporation does not originate or sponsor mortgage-backed securities. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The Corporation s primary sources of funds are deposits, proceeds from the sale of loans originated and purchased for sale, proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans, proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities, FHLB   San Francisco advances, access to the discount window facility at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and access to a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank.  While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds, deposit flows, mortgage prepayments and loan sales are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. 
    
  The primary investing activity of the Corporation is the origination and purchase of loans held for investment and loans held for sale.  During the first three months of fiscal 2017 and 2016, the Corporation originated and purchased $705.6 million and $575.5 million of loans, respectively.  The total loans sold in the first three months of fiscal 2017 and 2016 were $568.3 million and $601.0 million, respectively.  At September 30, 2016, the Corporation had loan origination commitments totaling $179.9 million, undisbursed lines of credit totaling $1.5 million and undisbursed construction loan funds totaling $10.4 million.  The Corporation anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current loan commitments. 
    
  The Corporation s primary financing activity is gathering deposits.  During the first three months of fiscal 2017, the net increase in deposits was $17.1 million or two percent, primarily due to the increase in transaction accounts, partly offset by scheduled maturities in time deposits.  The increase in transaction accounts and the decrease in time deposits were consistent with the Corporation's operating strategy.  As of September 30, 2016, total deposits were $943.5 million.  At September 30, 2016, time deposits scheduled to mature in one year or less were $147.5 million and total time deposits with a principal amount of $100,000 or higher were $152.2 million.   Historically, the Corporation has been able to retain a significant percentage of its time deposits as they mature by adjusting deposit rates to the current interest rate environment. 
    
  The Corporation must maintain an adequate level of liquidity to ensure the availability of sufficient funds to support loan growth and deposit withdrawals, to satisfy financial commitments and to take advantage of investment opportunities.  The Corporation generally maintains sufficient cash and cash equivalents to meet short-term liquidity needs.  At September 30, 2016, total cash and cash equivalents were $39.4 million, or three percent of total assets.  Depending on market conditions and the pricing of deposit products and FHLB   San Francisco advances, the Bank may rely on FHLB   San Francisco advances for part of its liquidity needs.  As of September 30, 2016, total borrowings were $146.3 million and the financing availability at FHLB   San Francisco was limited to 35 percent of total assets; the remaining borrowing facility was $257.2 million and the remaining available collateral was $607.9 million.  In addition, the Bank has secured a $42.5 million discount window facility at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, collateralized by investment securities with a fair market value of $45.2 million.  As of September 30, 2016, the Bank also has a borrowing arrangement in the form of a federal funds facility with its correspondent bank for $17.0 million which matures on June 30, 2017 which the Bank intends to renew upon maturity.  The Bank had no advances under its correspondent bank or discount window facility as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  Regulations require thrifts to maintain adequate liquidity to assure safe and sound operations. The Bank s average liquidity ratio (defined as the ratio of average qualifying liquid assets to average deposits and borrowings) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased to 29.9 percent from 31.2 percent for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. 
    
  The Bank, as a federally-chartered, federally insured savings bank, is subject to the capital requirements established by the OCC. Under the OCC's capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Bank's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices.  The Bank's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weighting and other factors. In addition, Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. as a savings and loan holding company registered with the FRB, is required by the FRB to maintain capital adequacy that generally parallels the OCC requirements.   
    
  At September 30, 2016, Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and the Bank each exceeded all regulatory capital requirements.  The Bank was categorized "well-capitalized" at September 30, 2016 under the regulations of the OCC. 

56 

Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and the Bank's actual and required minimum capital amounts and ratios at the dates indicated are as follows (dollars in thousands):  

In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, Provident Financial Holdings, Inc. and the Bank will have to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.  This new requirement began to be phased on January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year to an amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets when fully implemented in January 2019. 
    
  The ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to stockholders depends primarily on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Corporation.  The Bank may not declare or pay a cash dividend if the effect thereof would cause its net worth to be reduced below the regulatory capital requirements imposed by federal regulation.  In the first three months of fiscal 2017, the Bank paid a cash dividend of $10.0 million to the Corporation; while the Corporation paid $1.0 million of cash dividends to its shareholders.

Supplemental Information 

ITEM 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. 
    
  One of the Corporation s principal financial objectives is to achieve long-term profitability while reducing its exposure to fluctuating interest rates.  The Corporation has sought to reduce the exposure of its earnings to changes in interest rates by attempting to manage the repricing mismatch between interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.  The principal element in achieving this objective is to increase the interest-rate sensitivity of the Corporation s interest-earning assets by retaining for its portfolio new loan originations with interest rates subject to periodic adjustment to market conditions and by selling fixed-rate, single-family mortgage loans.  In addition, the Corporation maintains an investment portfolio, which is largely in U.S. government agency MBS and U.S. government sponsored enterprise MBS with contractual maturities of up to 30 years that reprice frequently.  The Corporation relies on retail deposits as its primary source of funds while utilizing FHLB   San Francisco advances as a secondary source of funding.  Management believes retail deposits, unlike brokered deposits, reduces the effects of interest rate fluctuations because they generally represent a more stable source of funds.  As part of its interest rate risk management strategy, the Corporation promotes transaction accounts and time deposits with terms up to seven years. 
    
  Through the use of an internal interest rate risk model, the Corporation is able to analyze its interest rate risk exposure by measuring the change in net portfolio value ( NPV ) over a variety of interest rate scenarios.  NPV is defined as the net present value of expected future cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts.  The calculation is intended to illustrate the change in NPV that would occur in the event of an immediate change in interest rates of -100, +100, +200, +300 and +400 basis points ( bp ) with no effect given to steps that management might take to counter the effect of the interest rate movement. The current federal funds rate is 0.50 percent making an immediate change of -200 and -300 basis points improbable. 
    
  The following table is derived from the internal interest rate risk model and represents the NPV based on the indicated changes in interest rates as of September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands). 

(1)   
    Represents the increase (decrease) of the NPV at the indicated interest rate change in comparison to the NPV at September 30, 2016 ( base case ). 
               (2)   
    Derived as the NPV divided by the portfolio value of total assets. 
               (3)   
    Derived as the change in the NPV ratio from the base case amount assuming the indicated change in interest rates (expressed in basis points). 

58 

The following table is derived from the internal interest rate risk model and represents the change in the NPV at a -100 basis point rate shock at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 

The pre-shock NPV ratio declined 134 basis points to 11.94% at September 30, 2016 from 13.28% at June 30, 2016 and the post-shock NPV ratio declined 119 basis points to 10.40% at September 30, 2016 from 11.59% at June 30, 2016.  The decline of the NPV ratios was primarily attributable to a $10.0 million cash dividend distribution from the Bank to the Corporation in September 2016, partly offset by the net income in the first three months of fiscal 2017. 
    
  As with any method of measuring interest rate risk, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing tables.  For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates.  Also, the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates.  Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset.  Further, in the event of a change in interest rates, expected rates of prepayments on loans and early withdrawals from time deposits could likely deviate significantly from those assumed when calculating the results described in the tables above.  It is also possible that, as a result of an interest rate increase, the higher mortgage payments required from ARM borrowers could result in an increase in delinquencies and defaults.  Changes in market interest rates may also affect the volume and profitability of the Corporation s mortgage banking operations.  Accordingly, the data presented in the tables in this section should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changes in interest rates.  Furthermore, the NPV presented in the foregoing tables is not intended to present the fair market value of the Corporation, nor does it represent amounts that would be available for distribution to shareholders in the event of the liquidation of the Corporation. 
    
  The Corporation also models the sensitivity of net interest income for the 12-month period subsequent to any given month-end assuming a dynamic balance sheet (accounting for the Corporation s current balance sheet, 12-month business plan, embedded options, rate floors, periodic caps, lifetime caps, and loan, investment, deposit and borrowing cash flows, among others), and immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates of plus 400, 300, 200 and 100 and minus 100 basis points.  The following table describes the results of the analysis at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 

At both September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Corporation was partially asset sensitive as its interest-earning assets are expected to reprice more quickly than its interest-bearing liabilities during the subsequent 12-month period.  Therefore at September 30, 2016, in a rising interest rate environment, the model projects an increase in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period, except under plus 100 basis point and plus 400 basis point scenarios.  In a falling interest rate environment, the results project a decrease in net interest income over the subsequent 12-month period. 
    
  Management believes that the assumptions used to complete the analysis described in the table above are reasonable.  However, past experience has shown that immediate, permanent and parallel movements in interest rates will not necessarily occur.  Additionally, while the analysis provides a tool to evaluate the projected net interest income to changes in interest rates, actual results may be substantially different if actual experience differs from the assumptions used to complete the analysis, particularly with respect to the 12-month business plan when asset growth is forecast.  Therefore, the model results that the  
  
   59 

Corporation discloses should be thought of as a risk management tool to compare the trends of the Corporation s current disclosure to previous disclosures, over time, within the context of the actual performance of the treasury yield curve. 

ITEM 4   Controls and Procedures. 
    
  a) An evaluation of the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Section 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Act )) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and the Corporation s Disclosure Committee as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.  In designing and evaluating the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.  Also, because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected.  Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.  Based on their evaluation, the Corporation s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Corporation s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 are effective, at the reasonable assurance level, in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Corporation in the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Corporation s management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. 
    
  b) There have been no changes in the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation s internal control over financial reporting.  The Corporation does not expect that its internal control over financial reporting will prevent all error and all fraud.  A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Corporation have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake.  Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.  The design of any control procedure is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings. 
    
  From time to time, the Corporation or its subsidiaries are engaged in legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, none of which are currently considered to have a material impact on the Corporation s financial position or results of operations, except as previously disclosed in Part I, Item 3 of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016 and the matter described below. 
    
  A wrongful termination lawsuit has been filed by an ex-employee of the Bank and on November 4, 2016 the jury awarded approximately $173,000 of damages to the ex-employee.  The Bank previously established a litigation reserve which is sufficient to cover the damages that were awarded.  However, in addition to the general damages awarded, the jury will also consider, and 
  may award, punitive damages which cannot be estimated, and therefore are not accrued, at the time of the filing of this Form 10-Q.  The Bank has not determined if it will file an appeal regarding this matter. 

60 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. 
    
  There have been no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
    
  The table below represents the Corporation s purchases of its equity securities for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 

(1)   
    Represents the remaining shares available for future purchases under the May 2016 stock repurchase plan which became effective upon the completion of the October 2015 stock repurchase plan. 
       
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation purchased 85,834 shares of the Corporation s common stock at an average cost of $19.36 per share, including the repurchase of 25,598 shares of distributed restricted stock at an average cost of $19.56 per share to cover employee withholding tax obligations, consistent with the distribution.  As of September 30, 2016, a total of 31,886 shares or eight percent of the shares authorized in the May 2016 stock repurchase plan have been purchased at an average cost of $19.26 per share, leaving 365,114 shares available for future purchases.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation did not sell any securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933. 
    
  The Corporation is subject to regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, which generally are the same as the capital requirements for the Bank.  These capital requirements include provisions that limit the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends to its stockholders or repurchase its shares.
