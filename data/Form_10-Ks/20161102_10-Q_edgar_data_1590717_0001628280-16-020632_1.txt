1.   ORGANIZATION 
  Separation from Ensign   Prior to June 1, 2014, CareTrust REIT, Inc. ( CareTrust  or the  Company ) was a wholly owned subsidiary of The Ensign Group, Inc. ( Ensign ). On June 1, 2014, Ensign completed the separation of its healthcare business and its real estate business into   two   separate and independent publicly-traded companies through the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of CareTrust to Ensign stockholders on a pro rata basis (the  Spin-Off ). Ensign stockholders received   one   share of CareTrust common stock for each share of Ensign common stock held at the close of business on May 22, 2014, the record date for the Spin-Off. The Spin-Off was effective from and after June 1, 2014, with shares of CareTrust common stock distributed by Ensign on June 2, 2014. The Company was formed on   October 29, 2013   and had minimal activity prior to the Spin-Off. 
  Description of Business   The Company s primary business consists of acquiring, financing and owning real property to be leased to third-party tenants in the healthcare sector. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned and leased to independent operators, including Ensign,   149   skilled nursing, assisted living and independent living facilities consisting of   14,304   operational beds and units located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. The Company also owns and operates   three   independent living facilities consisting of   264   units located in Texas and Utah. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company also had   three   other real estate investments, consisting of   $13.6 million   of preferred equity investments. 

2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Basis of Presentation   The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company reflect, for all periods presented, the historical financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries consisting of (i) the leased skilled nursing, assisted living and independent living facilities, (ii) the operations of the   three   independent living facilities and (iii) the preferred equity investments. 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the disclosures required by GAAP for a complete set of annual audited financial statements. The condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments which are of a normal and recurring nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results of the interim periods presented have been included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. All intercompany transactions and account balances within the Company have been eliminated. 
  Estimates and Assumptions   The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that the assumptions and estimates used in preparation of the underlying condensed consolidated financial statements are reasonable.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization   Costs related to the acquisition and improvement of properties are capitalized and amortized over the expected useful life of the asset on a straight-line basis. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred while significant replacements and betterments are capitalized. Repair and maintenance costs include all costs that do not extend the useful life of the real estate asset. The Company considers the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life. Expenditures for tenant improvements are capitalized and amortized over the shorter of the tenant s lease term or expected useful life. The Company anticipates the estimated useful lives of its assets by class to be generally as follows:

Real Estate Acquisition Valuation    In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 805,   Business Combinations  , the Company records the acquisition of income-producing real estate as a business combination. If the acquisition does not meet the definition of a business, the Company records the acquisition as an asset acquisition. Under both methods, all assets acquired and liabilities assumed are measured at their acquisition date fair values. For transactions accounted for as business combinations, acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and restructuring costs that do not meet the definition of a liability at the acquisition date are expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date. For transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, acquisition costs are capitalized as incurred. 
  The Company assesses the acquisition date fair values of all tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers, generally utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that applies appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors, including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions. The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. 
  Estimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities are based on a number of assumptions, including with respect to market lease rates, property-operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of inappropriate assumptions would result in an incorrect valuation of the Company s acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities, which would impact the amount of the Company s net income. 
  As part of our asset acquisitions, the Company may commit to provide contingent payments to a seller or lessee (e.g., an earn-out payable upon the applicable property achieving certain financial metrics).  Typically, when the contingent payments are funded, cash rent is increased by the amount funded multiplied by a rate stipulated in the agreement.  Generally, if the contingent payment is an earn-out provided to the seller, the payment is capitalized to the property's basis.  If the contingent payment is an earn-out provided to the lessee, the payment is recorded as a lease incentive and is amortized as a yield adjustment over the life of the lease.  
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   At each reporting period, management evaluates the Company s real estate investments for impairment indicators, including the evaluation of its assets  useful lives. Management also assesses the carrying value of the Company s real estate investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable. The judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on factors such as, but not limited to, market conditions, operator performance and legal structure. If indicators of impairment are present, management evaluates the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relation to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities. Provisions for impairment losses related to long-lived assets are recognized when expected future undiscounted cash flows are determined to be less than the carrying values of the assets. An adjustment is made to the net carrying value of the real estate investments for the excess of carrying value over fair value. All impairments are taken as a period cost at that time, and depreciation is adjusted going forward to reflect the new value assigned to the asset. 
  If the Company decides to sell real estate properties, it evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of the assets. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from estimated net sales proceeds, the property is written down to estimated fair value less costs to sell. 
  In the event of impairment, the fair value of the real estate investment is determined by market research, which includes valuing the property in its current use as well as other alternative uses, and involves significant judgment. The Company s estimates of cash flows and fair values of the properties are based on current market conditions and consider matters such as rental rates and occupancies for comparable properties, recent sales data for comparable properties, and, where applicable, contracts or the results of negotiations with purchasers or prospective purchasers. The Company s ability to accurately estimate future cash flows and estimate and allocate fair values impacts the timing and recognition of impairments.

While the Company believes its assumptions are reasonable, changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on financial results. 
  Other Real Estate Investments     Preferred equity investments are accounted for at unpaid principal balance, plus accrued return, net of reserves. The Company recognizes return income on the applicable basis set forth in the preferred equity instrument based on the outstanding investment including any accrued and unpaid return. As the preferred member of any joint venture in which the Company has an investment, the Company is not entitled to share in such joint venture s earnings or losses. Rather, the Company is entitled to receive a preferred return, which is deferred if the cash flow of the joint venture is insufficient to pay all of the accrued preferred return. The unpaid accrued preferred return is added to the balance of the preferred equity investment up to the estimated economic outcome assuming a hypothetical liquidation of the book value of the joint venture.  Any unpaid accrued preferred return, whether recorded or unrecorded by the Company, will be repaid upon redemption.  
  The Company evaluates at each reporting period each of its other real estate investments for indicators of impairment. An investment is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. A reserve is established for the excess of the carrying value of the investment over its fair value. 
     Cash and Cash Equivalents   Cash and cash equivalents consist of bank term deposits and money market funds with original maturities of three months or less at time of purchase and therefore approximate fair value. The fair value of these investments is determined based on  Level 1  inputs, which consist of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets. The Company places its cash and short-term investments with high credit quality financial institutions. 
  The Company s cash and cash equivalents balance periodically exceeds federally insurable limits. The Company monitors the cash balances in its operating accounts and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate; however, these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets. To date, the Company has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts. 
  Deferred Financing Costs   External costs incurred from placement of the Company's debt are capitalized and amortized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the related borrowings, which approximates the effective interest method. Amortization of deferred financing costs is classified as interest expense in the Company's condensed consolidated income statements. Accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs was   $3.7 million   and   $3.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  When financings are terminated, unamortized deferred financing costs, as well as charges incurred for the termination, are expensed at the time the termination is made. Gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt are presented within income from continuing operations in the Company's condensed consolidated income statements. 
  Revenue Recognition    The Company recognizes rental revenue, including rental abatements, lease incentives and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, if any, from tenants under lease arrangements with minimum fixed and determinable increases on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the related leases when collectability is reasonably assured. Tenant reimbursements of real estate taxes, insurance, repairs and maintenance, and other operating expenses are recognized as revenue in the period the expenses are incurred and presented gross if the Company is the primary obligor and, with respect to purchasing goods and services from third-party suppliers, has discretion in selecting the supplier and bears the associated credit risk. For each of the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , such tenant reimbursement revenues consist of real estate taxes. Contingent revenue, if any, is not recognized until all possible contingencies have been eliminated. 
  The Company evaluates the collectability of rents and other receivables on a regular basis based on factors including payment history, the operations, the asset type and current economic conditions. If the Company's evaluation of these factors indicates it may not recover the full value of the receivable, it provides a reserve against the portion of the receivable that it estimates may not be recovered. This analysis requires the Company to determine whether there are factors indicating a receivable may not be fully collectible and to estimate the amount of the receivable that may not be collected. The Company did not reserve any receivables as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

Income Taxes   The Company has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). The Company believes it has been organized and has operated, and the Company intends to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code.  To qualify as a REIT, the Company must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute to its stockholders at least   90%   of the Company s annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent it distributes as qualifying dividends all of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the   four   taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost unless the Internal Revenue Service grants the Company relief under certain statutory provisions.       
  Stock-Based Compensation   The Company accounts for share-based payment awards in accordance with ASC Topic 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   ( ASC 718 ). ASC 718 requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. ASC 718 requires all entities to apply a fair value-based measurement method in accounting for share-based payment transactions with directors, officers and employees except for equity instruments held by employee share ownership plans. Net income reflects stock-based compensation expense of   $0.3 million   and   $0.4 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $1.2 million   and   $1.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk   The Company is subject to concentrations of credit risk consisting primarily of operating leases on our owned properties. See Note 12,   Concentration of Risk  , for a discussion of major operator concentration. 
  Segment Disclosures    The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") accounting guidance regarding disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information establishes standards for the manner in which public business enterprises report information about operating segments. The Company has   one   reportable segment consisting of investments in healthcare-related real estate assets. 
  Earnings (Loss) Per Share   The Company calculates earnings (loss) per share ( EPS ) in accordance with ASC Topic 260,   Earnings Per Share  . Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income applicable to common stock by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the additional dilution for all potentially-dilutive securities.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards   In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (Topic 606) ( ASU No. 2014-09 ). ASU No. 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. ASU No. 2014-09 supersedes the revenue requirements in   Revenue Recognition   (Topic 605) and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. ASU No. 2014-09 does not apply to lease contracts within the scope of   Leases   (Topic 840). In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, which deferred the effective date of its new revenue recognition standard by one year.  The standard will be effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing the impact of adopting ASU No. 2014-09 but does not believe it will have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements when adopted. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall   (Subtopic 825-10) ( ASU No. 2016-01 ).  ASU No. 2016-01 updates guidance related to recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. ASU No. 2016-01 requires all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in ASU No. 2016-01 also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the amendments in ASU No. 2016-01 eliminate the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public business entities. ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements when adopted.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842) ( ASU No. 2016-02 ).  ASU No. 2016-02 supersedes guidance related to accounting for leases. ASU No. 2016-02 updates guidance around the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. The objective of ASU No. 2016-02 is to establish the principles that lessees and lessors shall apply to report useful information to users of financial statements about the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from a lease. ASU No. 2016-02 does not fundamentally change lessor accounting.  However, some changes have been made to lessor accounting to conform and align the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 with the lessee guidance and other areas within GAAP. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements when adopted. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU No. 2016-09"), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15"), which provided guidance on certain specific cash flow issues, including, but not limited to, debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investees. ASU 2016-15 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted and shall be applied retrospectively where practicable. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards   In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting (SEC Update)   ( ASU No. 2015-15 ). ASU No. 2015-15 was issued by the FASB in response to questions that arose after the issuance of ASU No. 2015-03, to incorporate a Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") staff announcement that the SEC staff will not object to an entity presenting the cost of securing a revolving line of credit as an asset, regardless of whether a balance is outstanding. ASU No. 2015-15 was effective upon announcement. 
  On December 31, 2015, the Company retrospectively early adopted, for all comparative periods presented, ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ("ASU No. 2015-03"). The amendments in ASU No. 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 resulted in a change to the location where debt issuance costs are presented in the balance sheet and did not have any other material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU No. 2015-02 ), which makes certain changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model, including changes to (1) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), (2) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination. ASU No. 2015-02 was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within these fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-02 did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments   ( ASU No. 2015-16 ). ASU No. 2015-16 eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. ASU No. 2015-16 was effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within these fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-16 did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   94   of the Company s   152   facilities were leased to subsidiaries of Ensign under   eight   master leases (the "Ensign Master Leases") which commenced on June 1, 2014. The obligations under the Ensign Master Leases are guaranteed by Ensign. A default by any subsidiary of Ensign with regard to any facility leased pursuant to an Ensign Master Lease will result in a default under all of the Ensign Master Leases. The initial annual revenues from the Ensign Master Leases were   $56.0 million   during each of the first   two years   of the Ensign Master Leases. Commencing on June 1, 2016, the annual revenues from the Ensign Master Leases are escalated annually by an amount equal to the product of (1) the lesser of the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index ( CPI ) (but not less than   zero  ) or   2.5%  , and (2) the prior year s rent. In addition to rent, the subsidiaries of Ensign that are tenants under the Ensign Master Leases are solely responsible for the costs related to the leased properties (including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance and repair costs). 
  As of September 30, 2016,   55   of the Company's   152   facilities were leased to various other operators under triple-net leases.  All of these leases contain annual escalators based on CPI some of which are subject to a cap, or fixed rent escalators. 
  The Company's   three   remaining properties as of September 30, 2016 are the independent living facilities that the Company owns and operates. 
  The Company has only   two   identified intangible assets which relate to a below-market ground lease and   three   acquired operating leases. The ground lease has a remaining term of   81 years  .

5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Under GAAP, the Company is required to measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, the Company is required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 

Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 
                
    Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
                
    Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
     Financial Instruments:   Considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the fair value of financial instruments. The estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized upon disposition of the financial instruments. A summary of the face values, carrying amounts and fair values of the Company s financial instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   using Level 2 inputs, for the senior unsecured notes payable, and Level 3 inputs, for all other financial instruments, is as follows (dollars in thousands):  

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and accounts payable and accrued liabilities:   These balances approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these instruments. 
  Preferred equity investments  : The carrying amounts were accounted for at the unpaid principal balance, plus accrued return, net of reserves, assuming a hypothetical liquidation of the book values of the joint ventures.  The fair value of the preferred equity investments were estimated using an internal valuation model that considered the expected future cash flows of the investment, the underlying collateral value and other credit enhancements.  In future periods, the fair value of the preferred equity investments may not be equal to the carrying amount.

Senior unsecured notes payable  : The fair value of the senior unsecured notes payable was determined using third-party quotes derived from orderly trades. 
  Unsecured revolving credit facility and senior unsecured term loan:   The fair values approximate their carrying values as the interest rates are variable and approximate prevailing market interest rates for similar debt arrangements. 
  Mortgage notes payable:   The fair value of the Company s notes payable were estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on management s estimates of current market interest rates for instruments with similar characteristics, including remaining loan term, loan-to-value ratio, type of collateral and other credit enhancements. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available,   the Company measured fair value using (i) a valuation technique that used the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets or (ii) another valuation technique that was consistent with the principles of fair value measurement, such as the income approach or the market approach.   The Company classified these inputs as Level 3 inputs. 

6.   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  Rental income from Ensign   The Company derives a majority of its rental income through operating lease agreements with Ensign. Ensign is a holding company with no direct operating assets, employees or revenue. All of Ensign s operations are conducted by separate independent but wholly-owned subsidiaries, each of which has its own management, employees and assets. See Note 12,   Concentration of Risk  , for a discussion of major operator concentration. 
  Christopher R. Christensen, one of the Company s directors from June 1, 2014 through April 15, 2015, served as the chief executive officer of Ensign as well as a member of Ensign s board of directors during such period. As such, all rental income and tenant reimbursements earned related to the Ensign Master Leases during Mr. Christensen's tenure on our board are considered related party in nature.  For the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized   $16.3 million   in rental income from Ensign while Mr. Christensen sat on the Board of the Company as well as   $1.4 million   of tenant reimbursements.  After April 15, 2015, the effective date of Mr. Christensen's resignation from our board of directors, rental income and tenant reimbursements related to the Ensign Master Leases, and any related accounts receivable, are not considered earned or due from a related party.

If certain changes of control of the Company occur, holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Issuers to repurchase their Notes at   101%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date. 
  The obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by the Company and certain of the Company s wholly owned existing and, subject to certain exceptions, future material subsidiaries (other than the Issuers); provided, however, that such guarantees are subject to automatic release under certain customary circumstances, including if the subsidiary guarantor is sold or sells all or substantially all of its assets, the subsidiary guarantor is designated  unrestricted  for covenant purposes under the indenture, the subsidiary guarantor s guarantee of other indebtedness which resulted in the creation of the guarantee of the Notes is terminated or released, or the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance or to discharge the indenture have been satisfied. See Note 13,   Summarized Condensed Consolidating Information  . 
  The indenture contains covenants limiting the ability of the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; incur or guarantee secured indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments or other restricted payments; sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of their assets; and create restrictions on the ability of the Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or other amounts to the Issuers. The indenture also requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a specified ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness. These covenants are subject to a number of important and significant limitations, qualifications and exceptions. The indenture also contains customary events of default. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the indenture. 
    
  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan 
  On August 5, 2015, the Company, CareTrust GP, LLC, the Operating Partnership, as the borrower, and certain of its wholly-owned subsidiaries entered into a credit and guaranty agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing bank and swingline lender, and the lenders party thereto (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement initially provided for an unsecured asset-based revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of   $300.0 million   from a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions. A portion of the proceeds of the Credit Facility were used to pay off and terminate the Company s existing secured asset-based revolving credit facility under a credit agreement dated May 30, 2014, with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto. On February 1, 2016, the Company entered into the First Amendment (the  Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, (i) commitments in respect of the Credit Facility were increased by   $100.0 million   to   $400.0 million  , (ii) a new   $100.0 million   non-amortizing unsecured term loan (the  Term Loan ) was funded, and (iii) the uncommitted incremental facility was increased by   $50.0 million   to   $250.0 million  . The Credit Facility continues to mature on August 5, 2019, subject to   two  ,   six  -month extension options. The Term Loan, which matures on February 1, 2023, may be prepaid at any time subject to a   2%   premium in the first year after issuance and a   1%   premium in the second year after issuance. Approximately   $95.0 million   of the proceeds of the Term Loan were used to pay off and terminate the Company s existing secured mortgage indebtedness under the Fifth Amended and Restated Loan Agreement, dated May 30, 2014 (the  GECC Loan ), with General Electric Capital Corporation, as agent and lender, and the other lenders party thereto (the  Refinancing ). The Company expects to use borrowings under the Credit Facility for working capital purposes, to fund acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. 
  As of September 30, 2016, there was   $103.0 million   outstanding under the Credit Facility.

9.   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  All stock-based awards are subject to the terms of the CareTrust REIT, Inc. and CTR Partnership, L.P. Incentive Award Plan (the  Plan ). The Plan provides for the granting of stock-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock, performance awards, restricted stock units and other incentive awards to officers, employees and directors in connection with their employment with or services provided to the Company. 
  Restricted Stock Awards     In connection with the Spin-Off, employees of Ensign who had unvested shares of restricted stock were given   one   share of CareTrust unvested restricted stock totaling   207,580   shares at the Spin-Off. These restricted shares are subject to a time vesting provision only and the Company does not recognize any stock compensation expense associated with these awards. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   38,000   shares vested or were forfeited. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   50,830   unvested restricted stock awards outstanding. 
  In May 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors granted   20,770   shares of restricted stock to members of the Board of Directors.  Each share had a fair market value on the date of grant of   $13.13   per share, based on the market price of the Company's common stock on that date, and the shares vest over   one year  . 
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized   $0.3 million   and   $0.4 million   of stock-based compensation expense, respectively.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company recognized   $1.2 million   and   $1.1 million   of stock-based compensation expense, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $2.7 million   of unamortized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested awards and the weighted-average remaining vesting period of such awards was   2.5   years.

The Company s unvested restricted shares associated with its incentive award plan and unvested restricted shares issued to employees of Ensign at the Spin-Off have been excluded from the above calculation of earnings per diluted share for both the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , as their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. 

11. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  U.S. Government Settlement   In October 2013, Ensign completed and executed a settlement agreement (the  Settlement Agreement ) with the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ). This settlement agreement fully and finally resolved a DOJ investigation of Ensign related primarily to claims submitted to the Medicare program for rehabilitation services provided at skilled nursing facilities in California and certain ancillary claims. Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Ensign made a single lump-sum remittance to the government in the amount of   $48.0 million   in October 2013. Ensign denied engaging in any illegal conduct and agreed to the settlement amount without any admission of wrongdoing in order to resolve the allegations and avoid the uncertainty and expense of protracted litigation. 
  In connection with the settlement and effective as of October 1, 2013, Ensign entered into a   five  -year corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General-HHS (the  CIA ). The CIA acknowledges the existence of Ensign s current compliance program, and requires that Ensign continue during the term of the CIA to maintain a compliance program designed to promote compliance with the statutes, regulations, and written directives of Medicare, Medicaid, and all other Federal health care programs. Ensign is also required to maintain several elements of its existing program during the term of the CIA, including maintaining a compliance officer, a compliance committee of the board of directors, and a code of conduct. The CIA requires that Ensign conduct certain additional compliance-related activities during the term of the CIA, including various training and monitoring procedures, and maintaining a disciplinary process for compliance obligations. 
    
  Participation in federal healthcare programs by Ensign is not affected by the Settlement Agreement or the CIA. In the event of an uncured material breach of the CIA, Ensign could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs and/or subject to prosecution. The Company is subject to certain continuing operational obligations as part of Ensign s compliance program pursuant to the CIA, but otherwise has no liability related to the DOJ investigation. 
  Legal Matters   None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party to, and none of their respective properties are the subject of, any material legal proceedings. 

12. CONCENTRATION OF RISK 
  Major operator concentration     As of   September 30, 2016  , Ensign leased   94   skilled nursing, assisted living and independent living facilities which had a total of   10,121   licensed beds and are located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Nebraska, Nevada, Texas, Utah and Washington.   The four states in which Ensign leases the highest concentration of properties are California, Texas, Utah and Arizona.      
  Additionally, on October 1, 2015, the Company acquired the Liberty Healthcare Portfolio, a   14   facility skilled nursing and assisted living portfolio in Ohio, for   $176.5 million   inclusive of transaction costs.  The Company has leased these   14   facilities to subsidiaries of Pristine Senior Living, LLC ("Pristine") pursuant to a triple-net master lease entered into effective as of October 1, 2015, which has an initial term of   15 years  ,   two     five  -year renewal options and no purchase options.

The annual revenues from the Pristine master lease are   $17.0 million   and will be escalated annually by an amount equal to the product of (1) the lesser of the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index (but not less than   zero  ) or   3.0%  , and (2) the prior year s rent. The Pristine master lease is guaranteed by Pristine and   two   of its principals.  Further, in April 2016, the Company acquired a   55  -bed skilled nursing facility and a skilled nursing and assisted living campus with   90   skilled nursing beds and   69   assisted living beds, both located in Cincinnati, Ohio, for   $14.7 million   inclusive of transaction costs. In connection with the acquisition, the Company amended its triple-net master lease with Pristine Senior Living and anticipates additional initial annual lease revenues of approximately   $1.4 million   following this acquisition.    
  Ensign is subject to the registration and reporting requirements of the SEC and is required to file with the SEC annual reports containing audited financial information and quarterly reports containing unaudited financial information.

  Overview 
  CareTrust REIT, Inc. ( CareTrust , the  Company , "we", "our", or "us") was formed on October 29, 2013, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Ensign. On June 1, 2014, Ensign completed the separation of its healthcare business and its real estate business into two separate and independent publicly traded companies through the distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock to Ensign stockholders on a pro rata basis (the  Spin-Off ). The Spin-Off was effective from and after June 1, 2014, with shares of our common stock distributed to Ensign stockholders on June 2, 2014. CareTrust holds substantially all of the real property that was previously owned by Ensign. As of September 30, 2016, we owned and leased to independent operators, including Ensign, 149 skilled nursing ("SNFs"), assisted living ("ALFs") and independent living  ("ILFs") facilities which had a total of 14,304 operational beds and units located in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.  We also own and operate three independent living facilities which had a total of 264 units located in Texas and Utah. As of September 30, 2016, we also had three other real estate investments, consisting of $13.6 million of preferred equity investments.  
  We are a separate and independent publicly traded, self-administered, self-managed REIT primarily engaged in the ownership, acquisition and leasing of healthcare-related properties. We generate revenues primarily by leasing healthcare-related properties to healthcare operators in triple-net lease arrangements, under which the tenant is solely responsible for the costs related to the property (including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance and repair costs). We conduct and manage our business as one operating segment for internal reporting and internal decision making purposes. We expect to grow our  
  
   29 

     Table of Contents  

portfolio by pursuing opportunities to acquire additional properties that will be leased to a diverse group of local, regional and national healthcare providers, which may include Ensign, as well as senior housing operators and related businesses. We also anticipate further diversifying our portfolio over time, including by acquiring properties in different geographic markets, and in different asset classes. 
  We elected to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, in a manner to qualify for taxation as a REIT.  We operate through an umbrella partnership, commonly referred to as an UPREIT structure, in which substantially all of our properties and assets are held through CTR Partnership, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ). The Operating Partnership is managed by CareTrust s wholly-owned subsidiary, CareTrust GP, LLC, which is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. To maintain REIT status, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains. 
    
  Recent Transactions 
    
  Offering of Common Stock 
    
  On March 28, 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of 9.78 million newly issued shares of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement.  We received net proceeds of $105.8 million from the offering, after giving effect to the issuance and sale of all 9.78 million shares of common stock (which included 1.28 million shares sold to the underwriters upon exercise of their option to purchase additional shares), at a price to the public of $11.35 per share. 
    
  At-The-Market Offering of Common Stock 
    
  During 2016, we entered into an equity distribution agreement to issue and sell, from time to time, up to $125.0 million in aggregate offering price of our common stock through an "at-the-market" equity offering program (the "ATM Program"). During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company sold 183,012 shares of common stock at an average price of $15.61 per share for $2.9 million in gross proceeds. At September 30, 2016, we had $122.2 million available under the ATM Program. 
    
  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan 
    
  See  - Liquidity and Capital Resources  below for a description of the Company s unsecured credit facility, which the  
  Company entered into in August 2015 and amended in February 2016. We used approximately $95.0 million of proceeds from the $100.0 million non-amortizing unsecured term loan funded in February 2016 to pay off and terminate our secured mortgage indebtedness with General Electric Capital Corporation (the "GECC Loan"). 
    
  Recent Acquisitions 
    
  From January 1, 2016 through November 1, 2016, we acquired 30 properties, comprising 14 ALFs, 15 SNFs and 1 skilled nursing facility campus, for approximately $186.6 million inclusive of estimated capitalized transaction costs. During this period, we also completed two preferred equity investments totaling $4.5 million.

  Operating Results 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015:    

* Not meaningful 
    
  Rental income  . Rental income was $24.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $15.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The $8.4 million or 53% increase in rental income is primarily due to new investments made after July 1, 2015. 
  Independent living facilities.    Revenues from our three ILFs that we own and operate were $766,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $626,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The $140,000 or 22% increase was primarily due to increased occupancy at the facilities and a higher average rental rate per unit. Expenses were $708,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $610,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The $98,000 increase was primarily due to the increased occupancy. 
  Interest and other income.   Interest and other income decreased $189,000 for the three months ended September  30, 2016  to $72,000 compared to $261,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The net decrease was due to the cessation of accruing interest on one preferred equity investment slightly offset by two new preferred equity investments that closed during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Depreciation and amortization.   Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.4 million or 42% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $8.2 million compared to $5.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The $2.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization was due to new investments made after July 1, 2015. 
  Interest expense.   Interest expense decreased $1.5 million or 20% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $5.7 million compared to $7.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was due primarily to lower interest expense of $1.4 million resulting from the pay off of the GECC loan with the unsecured term loan, a $1.2 million write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the payoff and termination of our senior secured revolving credit facility and $0.2 million related to the secured revolving credit facility, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $0.6 million from our unsecured term loan, $0.5 million from greater borrowings under our unsecured credit facility, and $0.2 million related to amortization of deferred financing fees.  
  General and administrative expense.   General and administrative expense decreased $9,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to $2.3 million compared to $2.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The $9,000 decrease is primarily related to lower cash and noncash wages offset by increased corporate type costs and state taxes.

Revenues from our three ILFs that we own and operate were $2.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

  Depreciation and amortization.   Depreciation and amortization expense increased $6.3 million or 37% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $23.4 million compared to $17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Interest expense decreased $1.7 million or 9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $17.4 million compared to $19.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was due primarily to lower interest expense of $3.6 million resulting from the pay off of the GECC loan with the unsecured term loan, a $1.2 million write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the payoff and termination of our senior secured revolving credit facility and $0.7 million related to the secured revolving credit facility, partially offset by an increase in interest expense of $1.7 million from our unsecured term loan, $1.1 million from greater borrowings under our credit facility, $0.8 million related to amortization of deferred financing fees and a $0.3 million write-off of deferred financing fees associated with the payoff and termination of the GECC loan. 
  General and administrative expense.   General and administrative expense increased $1.3 million or 24% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to $6.7 million compared to $5.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The $1.3 million increase is primarily related to higher cash and noncash wages as well as increased staffing. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources

     Table of Contents  

We are required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding any net capital gains, to our stockholders on an annual basis in order to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, we intend to make, but are not contractually bound to make, regular quarterly dividends to common stockholders from cash flow from operating activities. All such dividends are at the discretion of our board of directors. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 9.78 million shares of our common stock for net proceeds, before expenses, of $106.2 million and refinanced our Credit Agreement (as defined below), including entering into a new $100.0 million term loan and using approximately $95.0 million of the proceeds to pay off and terminate our then-existing secured mortgage indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016, there was $103.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility (as defined below). See Note 7,   Debt,   and Note 8,   Equity,   in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.  We believe that our available cash, expected operating cash flows and the availability under our Credit Facility will provide sufficient funds for our operations, anticipated scheduled debt service payments and dividend requirements for at least the next twelve months. 
  On May 13, 2016, we commenced the ATM Program.  Pursuant to the ATM Program, sales of shares of our common stock, if any, will be made through the sales agents acting as agent and, subject to certain conditions, may be made through the sales agents acting as principal, and will be made by means of ordinary brokers  transactions on the NASDAQ Global Select Market or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.  Prior to July 1, 2016, we had not sold any common stock under the ATM program.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold 183,012 shares of our common stock at an average price of $15.61 per share resulting in gross proceeds of $2.9 million. 
  We intend to invest in additional healthcare properties as suitable opportunities arise and adequate sources of financing are available. We expect that future investments in properties, including any improvements or renovations of current or newly-acquired properties, will depend on and will be financed by, in whole or in part, our existing cash, borrowings available to us under the Credit Facility (as defined below), future borrowings or the proceeds from sales of shares of our common stock pursuant to our ATM Program or additional issuances of common stock or other securities. In addition, we may seek financing from U.S. government agencies, including through Fannie Mae and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, in appropriate circumstances in connection with acquisitions and refinancings of existing mortgage loans. 
  Although we are subject to restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, we expect that we will be able to refinance existing indebtedness or incur additional indebtedness for acquisitions or other purposes, if needed. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, incur additional indebtedness or access additional sources of capital, such as by issuing common stock or other debt or equity securities, on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following table presents selected data from our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented: 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $49.5 million compared to $29.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $20.5 million. The increase was  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

primarily due to an increase in net income of $15.9 million and noncash income and expenses of $5.6 million partially offset by a $1.1 million change in operating assets and liabilities. 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $191.2 million compared to $231.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $40.7 million. The decrease was primarily the result of a $46.2 million decrease in acquisitions partially offset by an increase of $4.5 million of preferred equity investments and a $1.0 million escrow deposit for an acquisition. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $142.1 million compared to $189.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $47.5 million. This decrease was due to lower net proceeds of $55.1 million from common stock offerings, an increase in dividends paid of $13.3 million and net-settlements of restricted stock of $0.4 million offset by lower net borrowings of $20.5 million and deferred financing fees of $0.8 million. 
    
  Indebtedness 
  Senior Unsecured Notes 
  On May 30, 2014, the Operating Partnership, and its wholly owned subsidiary, CareTrust Capital Corp. (together with the Operating Partnership, the  Issuers ), completed a private offering of $260.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2021 (the  Notes ). The Notes were issued at par, resulting in gross proceeds of $260.0 million and net proceeds of approximately $253.0 million after deducting underwriting fees and other offering expenses. We transferred approximately $220.8 million of the net proceeds of the offering of the Notes to Ensign, and used the remaining net proceeds of the offering to pay the cash portion of the December 2014 special dividend. The Notes mature on June 1, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 5.875% per year. Interest on the Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on December 1, 2014. The Issuers subsequently exchanged the Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933. 
  The Issuers may redeem the Notes any time before June 1, 2017 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount of the Notes redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date, plus a  make whole  premium described in the indenture governing the Notes and, at any time on or after June 1, 2017, at the redemption prices set forth in the indenture. At any time on or before June 1, 2017, up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes may be redeemed with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings if at least 65% of the originally issued aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding. If certain changes of control of CareTrust occur, holders of the Notes will have the right to require the Issuers to repurchase their Notes at 101% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the repurchase date. 
  The obligations under the Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on an unsecured basis, by CareTrust and certain of CareTrust s wholly-owned existing and, subject to certain exceptions, future material subsidiaries (other than the Issuers); provided, however, that such guarantees are subject to automatic release under certain customary circumstances, including if the subsidiary guarantor is sold or sells all or substantially all of its assets, the subsidiary guarantor is designated  unrestricted  for covenant purposes under the indenture, the subsidiary guarantor s guarantee of other indebtedness which resulted in the creation of the guarantee of the Notes is terminated or released, or the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance or to discharge the indenture have been satisfied. See Note 13,   Summarized Condensed Consolidating Information  . 
  The indenture contains covenants limiting the ability of CareTrust and its restricted subsidiaries to: incur or guarantee additional indebtedness; incur or guarantee secured indebtedness; pay dividends or distributions on, or redeem or repurchase, capital stock; make certain investments or other restricted payments; sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; merge or consolidate or sell all or substantially all of their assets; and create restrictions on the ability of the Issuers and their restricted subsidiaries to pay dividends or other amounts to the Issuers. The indenture also requires CareTrust and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a specified ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness. These covenants are subject to a number of important and significant limitations, qualifications and exceptions. The indenture also contains customary events of default. 
  As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the indenture. 
  Unsecured Credit Facility and Term Loan 
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

On August 5, 2015, the Company, CareTrust GP, LLC, the Operating Partnership, as the borrower, and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into a credit and guaranty agreement with KeyBank National Association, as administrative agent, an issuing bank and swingline lender, and the lenders party thereto (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement initially provided for an unsecured asset-based revolving credit facility (the  Revolving Facility ) with commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million from a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions, and an accordion feature that allows the Operating Partnership to increase the borrowing availability by up to an additional $200.0 million. A portion of the proceeds of the Revolving Facility were used to pay off and terminate the Company s existing secured asset-based revolving credit facility under a credit agreement dated May 30, 2014, with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto.  
   On February 1, 2016, the Company, CareTrust GP, LLC, the Operating Partnership, as the borrower, and certain of its wholly owned subsidiaries entered into the First Amendment (the  Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the Amendment, (i) commitments in respect of the Credit Facility (as defined below) were increased by $100.0 million to $400.0 million total, (ii) a new $100.0 million non-amortizing unsecured term loan (the  Term Loan  and, together with the Revolving Facility, the "Credit Facility") was funded and (iii) the uncommitted incremental facility was increased by $50.0 million to $250.0 million. Approximately $95.0 million of the proceeds of the Term Loan were used to pay off and terminate the GECC Loan (the "GECC Refinancing").  See "General Electric Capital Corporation Loan" below. 
  As of September 30, 2016, there was $103.0 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. 
  The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of August 5, 2019, and includes two six-month extension options.  The Term Loan, which matures on February 1, 2023, may be prepaid at any time subject to a 2% premium in the first year after issuance and a 1% premium in the second year after issuance. 
  The Credit Agreement initially provided that, subject to customary conditions, including obtaining lender commitments and pro forma compliance with financial maintenance covenants under the Credit Agreement, the Operating Partnership may seek to increase the aggregate principal amount of the revolving commitments and/or establish one or more new tranches of incremental revolving or term loans under the Credit Facility in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200.0 million.  Pursuant to the Amendment, the uncommitted incremental facility was increased by $50.0 million to $250.0 million effective February 1, 2016. The Company does not currently have any commitments for such increased loans.  
  The interest rates applicable to loans under the Revolving Facility are, at the Company s option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.40% per annum or applicable LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.40% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Company s election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long term unsecured debt). Pursuant to the Amendment, the interest rates applicable to the Term Loan are, at the Company s option, equal to a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.95% to 1.60% per annum or applicable LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.95% to 2.60% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Company's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long term unsecured debt). 
  In addition, the Company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments under the Revolving Facility of 0.15% or 0.25% per annum, based upon usage of the Revolving Facility (unless the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long term unsecured debt and elects to decrease the applicable margin as described above, in which case the Company will pay a facility fee on the revolving commitments ranging from 0.125% to 0.30% per annum based upon the credit ratings of its senior long term unsecured debt).  
  The Credit Facility is guaranteed, jointly and severally, by the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries that are party to the Credit Agreement (other than the Operating Partnership). The Credit Agreement contains customary covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to grant liens on their assets, incur indebtedness, sell assets, make investments, engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations, amend certain material agreements and pay certain dividends and other restricted payments. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to comply with financial maintenance covenants to be tested quarterly, consisting of a maximum debt to asset value ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum tangible net worth, a maximum cash distributions to operating income ratio, a maximum secured debt to asset value ratio and a maximum secured recourse debt to asset value ratio. The Credit Agreement also contains certain customary events of default, including that the Company is required to operate in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. 
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Credit Agreement.

General Electric Capital Corporation Loan 
  Ten of our properties were subject to secured mortgage indebtedness under the GECC Loan, which we assumed in connection with the Spin-Off.  As of February 1, 2016, in connection with the Amendment, the GECC Loan was paid off and terminated as part of the GECC Refinancing. 
  Obligations and Commitments 
  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Amounts include interest payments of $76.4 million. 
              (2) 
    Amounts include interest payments of $16.5 million. 
              (3) 
    The unsecured revolving credit facility includes payments related to the unused credit facility fee due on the amount of unused borrowings and assumes principal outstanding and interest rates in effect as of September 30, 2016. 
     Capital Expenditures 
  We anticipate incurring average annual capital expenditures of $400 to $500 per unit in connection with the operations of our three ILFs. Capital expenditures for each property leased under our triple-net leases are generally the responsibility of the tenant, except that, for the facilities leased to subsidiaries of Ensign under eight master leases ("Ensign Master Leases"), the tenant will have an option to require us to finance certain capital expenditures up to an aggregate of 20% of our initial investment in such property, subject to a corresponding rent increase at the time of funding.  For our other triple-net master leases besides the Ensign Master Leases, the tenants also have the option to request capital expenditure funding that would also be subject to a corresponding rent increase at the time of funding. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information set forth in the Accounting Standards Codification, as published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base these estimates on our experience and assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, we may have applied a different accounting treatment, resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements. We periodically reevaluate our estimates and assumptions, and in the event they prove to be different from actual results, we make adjustments in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Please refer to our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on February 11, 2016, for further information regarding the critical accounting policies that affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  There have been no material changes in such critical accounting policies during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk with respect to our variable rate indebtedness.  
  Our Credit Agreement provides for revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount of $400.0 million from a syndicate of banks and other financial institutions. As of September 30, 2016, we had $103.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility. The interest rates per annum applicable to loans under the Credit Facility are, at the Company s option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.40% per annum or applicable LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.40% per annum, based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Company's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long term unsecured debt).  Pursuant to the Amendment, the interest rates applicable to the Term Loan are, at the Company s option, equal to a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.95% to 1.60% per annum or applicable LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.95% to 2.60% per annum based on the debt to asset value ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries (subject to decrease at the Company's election if the Company obtains certain specified investment grade ratings on its senior long term unsecured debt).  As of September 30, 2016, we had a $100.0 million Term Loan outstanding. 
  An increase in interest rates could make the financing of any acquisition by us more costly as well as increase the costs of our variable rate debt obligations. Rising interest rates could also limit our ability to refinance our debt when it matures or cause us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing and increase interest expense on refinanced indebtedness. Assuming a 100 basis point increase in the interest rates related to our variable rate debt, and assuming no change in our outstanding debt balance as described above, interest expense would have increased $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  We may, in the future, manage, or hedge, interest rate risks related to our borrowings by means of interest rate swap agreements. However, the REIT provisions of the Code substantially limit our ability to hedge our assets and liabilities. See  Risk Factors   Risks Related to Our Status as a REIT   Complying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and may cause us to incur tax liabilities,  which is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, we had no swap agreements to hedge our interest rate risks. We also expect to manage our exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rates for our indebtedness. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exhange Act of 1934, as amended ("Exchange Act")) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is processed, recorded, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and regulations and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  As of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, regarding the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, at the reasonable assurance level, as of September 30, 2016. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
  None of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party to, and none of their respective properties are the subject of, any material legal proceedings.
