PART I

Item 1.     Business 

Overview 

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Walgreens Boots Alliance ) is the first global, pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise with sales of $117.4 billion in the fiscal year ended August 31, 2016. Our purpose is to help people across the world lead healthier and happier lives.

Walgreens Boots Alliance is the largest retail pharmacy, health and daily living destination across the U.S. and Europe. Walgreens Boots Alliance and the companies in which it has equity method investments together have a presence in more than 25  (1)  countries and employ more than 400,000 (1)  people. The company is a global leader in pharmacy-led, health and wellbeing retail and, together with the companies in which it has equity method investments, has over 13,200 (1)  stores in 11 (1)  countries as well as one of the largest global pharmaceutical wholesale and distribution networks, with over 390 (1)  distribution centers delivering to more than 230,000 (2)  pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year in more than 20 (1)  countries. In addition, Walgreens Boots Alliance is one of the world s largest purchasers of prescription drugs and many other health and wellbeing products.

Our portfolio of retail and business brands includes Walgreens, Duane Reade, Boots and Alliance Healthcare, as well as increasingly global health and beauty product brands,  such as  No7, Botanics, Liz Earle and Soap   Glory. Our global brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house new product research and development and manufacturing capabilities. We seek to further drive innovative ways to address global health and wellness challenges. We believe we are well positioned to expand customer offerings in existing markets and become a health and wellbeing partner of choice in emerging markets.

Walgreens Boots Alliance was incorporated in Delaware in 2014 and, as described below, is the successor of Walgreen Co., an Illinois corporation, which was formed in 1909 as a successor to a business founded in 1901. Our principal executive offices are located at 108 Wilmot Road, Deerfield, Illinois 60015. Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol  WBA .

Recent Transactions 

On March 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation ( AmerisourceBergen ) common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. Following the August 25, 2016 warrant exercise, we do not hold any further warrants to purchase shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock. As of August 31, 2016, we owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors. As of August 31, 2016, we can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate a second member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.

Effective March 18, 2016, we account for our investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. Due to the March 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, our results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Similarly, due to the timing of the warrant exercise and the two month reporting lag, our results for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2016 will include approximately five weeks of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on August 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.

On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance became the successor of Walgreens pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure, with Walgreens Boots Alliance becoming the parent holding company. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, which was formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Also on December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots GmbH ( Alliance Boots ) that Walgreens did not previously own (the  Second Step Transaction ) in exchange for  3.133 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The consolidated financial statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.

In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen   announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S.; and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics   pharmaceutical products through Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH ( WBAD ), the Company s global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. 

(1)  As of 31 August 2016, using publicly available information for AmerisourceBergen.

(2)  For 12 months ending 31 August 2016, using publicly available information for AmerisourceBergen.

In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we  obtained  the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergen s board of directors in certain circumstances.  Please refer to our Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements. 

In addition, we have undertaken a number of additional acquisitions, divestitures, and strategic initiatives in recent years designed to grow our businesses and enhance our competitive position. Please refer to MD A in Part II, Item 7 below and Note 3, Restructuring, Note 5, Equity Method Investments and Note 7, Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below for additional information.

Pending Transaction 

On October 27, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rite Aid Corporation ( Rite Aid ) and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the  Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which the Company agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire Rite Aid, a drugstore chain in the United States with 4,550 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia as of August 27, 2016. The Merger Agreement was approved by Rite Aid stockholders in February 2016. The transaction is expected to close  in early    calendar  2017 , subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions . 

Industry Overview 

The retail pharmacy and pharmaceutical wholesale industries  across the globe  are highly competitive and have been experiencing consolidation in recent years. Prescription drugs play a significant role in healthcare and constitute a first line of treatment for many medical conditions. We believe  the long-term outlook for prescription drug utilization is strong due, in part, to aging populations, increases in life expectancy, increases in the availability and utilization of generic drugs, the continued development of innovative drugs that improve quality of life and control healthcare costs, and increases in the number of persons with insurance coverage for prescription drugs, including, in the United States, the expansion of healthcare insurance coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the  ACA ) and  baby boomers  increasingly becoming eligible for the federally funded Medicare Part D prescription program.   Pharmaceutical wholesalers act   as a vital link between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and healthcare providers in supplying pharmaceuticals to patients.

Table of Contents 

The retail pharmacy industry  across the globe  relies significantly on private and governmental third party payers. Many private organizations throughout the healthcare industry, including pharmacy benefit management ( PBM ) companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power. Third party payers, including the Medicare Part D plans and the state-sponsored Medicaid and related managed care Medicaid agencies in the United States, can change eligibility requirements or reduce certain reimbursement rates. In addition, in many European countries, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility, and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Changes in law or regulation also can impact reimbursement rates and terms. For example, the ACA seeks to reduce federal spending by altering the Medicaid reimbursement formula ( AMP ) for multi-source drugs  in the United States and the UK Department of Health plans to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the National Health Service by reducing drug reimbursement rates.  These changes generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements  in the United States and pharmacy reimbursements in the UK . State Medicaid programs are also expected to continue to seek reductions in reimbursements independent of AMP. When third party payers or governmental authorities take actions that restrict eligibility or reduce prices or reimbursement rates, sales and margins in the retail pharmacy industry could be reduced, which would adversely affect industry profitability. In some cases, these possible adverse effects may be partially or entirely offset by controlling inventory costs and other expenses, dispensing more higher margin generics, finding new revenue streams through pharmacy services or other offerings and/or dispensing a greater volume of prescriptions.

Generic prescription drugs have continued to help lower overall costs for customers and third party payers. We expect the utilization of generic pharmaceuticals to continue to increase.  In general, in the United States, generic versions of drugs generate lower sales dollars per prescription, but higher gross profit   dollars, as compared with patent-protected brand name drugs. The positive impact on retail pharmacy gross profit   dollars can be significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a  generic conversion . In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can vary and the timing of generic conversions can be difficult to predict, which can have a significant impact on retail pharmacy sales and gross profit   dollars. 

We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements and other pressures will continue to cause the industries in which we compete to evolve. Pharmacists are on the frontlines of the healthcare delivery system, and we believe rising healthcare costs and the limited supply of primary care physicians present new opportunities for pharmacists and retail pharmacies to play an even greater role in driving positive outcomes for patients and payers through expanded service offerings such as immunizations and other preventive care, healthcare clinics, pharmacist-led medication therapy management and chronic condition management.

Segments 

Our operations are organized into three divisions, which are also our reportable segments:  

Retail Pharmacy USA;

Retail Pharmacy International; and

Pharmaceutical Wholesale.

For fiscal 2016, our segment sales were:  Retail Pharmacy USA, $83.8 billion; Retail Pharmacy International, $13.3 billion; and Pharmaceutical Wholesale, $22.6 billion. Additional information relating to our segments is included in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 below and in Note 18, Segment Reporting to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

Retail Pharmacy USA

Our Retail Pharmacy USA division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail  offerings  in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, each focused on helping people feel happy and healthy. We operated 8,175 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2016. Our principal retail pharmacy brands in the division are Walgreens and Duane Reade. We are a market leader in the United States and, as of August 31, 2016, approximately 76% of the population of the United States lived within five miles of a Walgreens or Duane Reade retail pharmacy.

We provide customers with convenient, omni-channel access to consumer goods and services, including own branded general merchandise such as NICE!, DeLish TM  and Well at Walgreens, as well as pharmacy and health and wellness services in communities across America. Our  walgreens .com website receives an average of 58 million visits per month. Integrated with our e-commerce platform, the Walgreens mobile application allows customers to refill prescriptions through scan technology, receive text messages alerting when a refill is due and other retail functionality, such as photo and shopping features.

Our services help improve health outcomes for patients and manage costs for payers including employers, managed care organizations, health systems, PBM companies and the public sector. We utilize our retail network as a channel to provide health and wellness services to our customers and patients, as illustrated by our ability to play a significant role in providing flu vaccines and other immunizations. We also provide specialty pharmacy services . As  of August 31, 2016,  we  had approximately 400 in-store clinic locations throughout the United States, some of which are operated by the Company and some of which are operated by health system partners. We have more than 76,000 healthcare service providers, including pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, nurse practitioners and other health related professionals.

The components of the division s sales are Pharmacy (the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services) and Retail (the sale of healthcare and retail products including non-prescription drugs, beauty, toiletries and general merchandise). The division s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, particularly the winter holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons. This seasonality also can affect the division s proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the division s fiscal year sales were as follows:

We filled 740.1 million prescriptions (including immunizations) in the division in fiscal 2016. Adjusted to 30-day equivalents, prescriptions filled were 928.5 million in fiscal 2016. Sales where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, PBM companies and private insurance were  approximately  97% of the division s fiscal 2016 pharmacy sales.

We fill prescriptions for many state Medicaid public assistance programs. Sales from all such Medicaid plans were approximately 4  % of  the division s fiscal 2016 sales . Sales from Medicare Part D plans were approximately 17  % of the division s fiscal 2016 sales. 

Our U.S. loyalty program, Balance  Rewards, is designed to reward our most valuable customers and encourage shopping in stores and online. Balance  Rewards members receive special pricing on select products and earn everyday rewards points for purchasing most merchandise that can be instantly redeemed at our stores or through walgreens.com. As of August 31, 2016, the number of active Balance  Rewards members totaled 87.4 million. For this purpose, we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months.

AmerisourceBergen supplies and distributes a significant amount of generic and branded pharmaceutical products to the division s  pharmacies.  We purchase our non-pharmaceutical merchandise from numerous manufacturers and wholesalers.

Our sales, and gross profit are impacted by, among other things, both the percentage of prescriptions that we fill that are generic and the rate at which new generic drugs are introduced to the market. Because any number of factors outside of our control can affect timing for a generic conversion, we face substantial uncertainty in predicting when such conversions will occur and what effect they will have on particular future periods.

The current environment of our     pharmacy business also  includes ongoing reimbursement pressure and a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail (one prescription that is the equivalent  of three 30-day prescriptions ) and Medicare Part D prescriptions. Further consolidation among generic manufacturers coupled with changes in the  number of major brand name drugs anticipated to undergo a conversion from branded to generic status  may also result in gross margin pressures within the industry.

We continuously face reimbursement pressure from PBM companies, health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations and other commercial third party payers; our agreements with these payers are regularly subject to expiration, termination or renegotiation. In addition, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. We experienced lower reimbursement rates in fiscal 2016 as compared to the same period in the prior year. Further,  we accepted lower Medicare Part D reimbursement rates for calendar 2016 compared to calendar 2015 in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs.We expect this trend to continue.

Table of Contents 

We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in pharmacy provider networks they offer. The prescription volume impact of new agreements and relationships typically is incremental over time. In fiscal 2017, we anticipate prescription growth to be relatively stronger in the second half of the fiscal year reflecting the timing and development of these strategic relationships . 

Our 90-day at retail prescription drug offering is typically at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions, but provides us with the opportunity to increase business with patients with chronic prescription needs while offering increased convenience, helping facilitate improved prescription adherence and resulting in a lower cost to fill the 90-day prescription. 

Retail Pharmacy International

Our Retail Pharmacy International division (excluding equity method investments) has pharmacy-led health and beauty retail businesses in eight countries, each focused on helping people look and feel their best. We operated 4,673 retail stores in the division as of August 31, 2016 (see  Properties  in Part I, Item 2 below for information regarding geographic coverage), and have grown our online presence significantly in recent years. Our principal retail pharmacy brands are Boots in the United Kingdom, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland and The Netherlands, Benavides in Mexico and Ahumada in Chile. In Europe, we are a market leader and our retail stores are conveniently located and our pharmacists are well placed to provide a significant role in the provision of healthcare services, working closely with other primary healthcare providers in the communities we serve.

The Boots omni-channel offering is differentiated from that of competitors due to the product brands we own, such as No7, Boots Pharmaceuticals, Botanics, Liz Earle, Soap   Glory, and  only at Boots  exclusive products, together with our long established reputation for trust and customer care. Our brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house product research and development and manufacturing capabilities.

Our retail store networks are typically complemented by online platforms. In the United Kingdom, our transactional website, boots.com,  receives on average approximately 20 million visits monthly. Through the boots.com website and integrated mobile application, our  order and collect  service allows customers to order from a range of over 35,000 products by 8:00 p.m. and collect from noon the following day from approximately  95 % of the United Kingdom s retail stores as of August 31, 2016.

The Boots Advantage Card loyalty program, where customers earn points on purchases for redemption at a later date, continues to be a key element of the Boots offering. As of August 31, 2016, the number of active Boots Advantage Card members totaled 15.5 million. For this purpose, we define an active member as someone who has used their card in the last six months.

In addition, Boots in the United Kingdom is one of the leaders in the optical market with 636 practices, of which 182 operated on a franchise basis as of August 31, 2016. Approximately 30% of these optical practices are located in Boots stores with the balance being standalone optical practices.

The components of the division s sales are Pharmacy (typically the sale of prescription drugs and provision of pharmacy-related services, subject to variation in particular jurisdictions depending upon regulatory and other factors) and Retail (primarily the sale of health and beauty products including beauty, toiletries and lifestyle merchandising, non-prescription drugs and, in the United Kingdom, the provision of optical services).

The division s sales are subject to the influence of seasonality, with the second fiscal quarter typically the strongest as a result of the winter holiday period. This seasonality affects the division s proportion of sales between Retail and Pharmacy during certain periods. The components of the division s fiscal year sales were as follows:

 Fiscal 2015 includes periods subsequent to the Second Step Transaction, for the months of January through August 2015.

The division s Retail sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, the highly competitive nature of the health and beauty category, specifically our and our competitors pricing actions, promotional offers and events and our customer s desire for value and convenience.

The division s Pharmacy sales, gross margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by governmental agencies and other third party payers seeking to minimize increases in the costs of healthcare, including pharmaceutical drug reimbursement rates. In the United Kingdom,  which is the division s  largest market for Pharmacy sales, the amount of government funding available for pharmacy services is  typically  reviewed and agreed with the pharmacy industry on an annual basis .   In fiscal 2017, the UK Department of Health has indicated that they plan to implement funding cuts to reduce costs within the National Health Service, the publicly-funded healthcare system . 

In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British Pounds Sterling being the most significant.

Pharmaceutical Wholesale

Our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division (excluding equity method investments), which mainly operates under the Alliance Healthcare brand, supplies medicines, other healthcare products and related services to more than 110,000 pharmacies, doctors, health centers and hospitals each year from 288 distribution centers in 11 countries, primarily in Europe, as of August 31, 2016.

The distribution of prescription medicines to pharmacists comprises the vast majority of the division s sales. Our wholesale businesses seek to provide high core service levels to pharmacists in terms of frequency of delivery, product availability, delivery accuracy, timeliness and reliability at competitive prices. We also offer customers innovative added-value services to help pharmacists develop their own businesses. This includes membership of Alphega Pharmacy, our pan-European network for independent pharmacies, which, as of August 31, 2016, had over 5,700 members.

In addition to the wholesale of medicines and other healthcare products, our businesses provide services to pharmaceutical manufacturers who are increasingly seeking to gain greater control over their product distribution, while at the same time outsourcing non-core activities. These services include pre-wholesale and contract logistics (mainly under the Alloga brand), direct deliveries to pharmacies, and innovative and specialized healthcare services, covering clinical homecare, medicine support, dispensing services, medicine preparation and clinical trial support (mainly under the Alcura brand).

Combined with local engagement, scale is important in pharmaceutical wholesaling. We are one of the largest pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors in Europe, and we rank as one of the top three in market share in many of the individual countries in which we operate.

Our sales, gross profit margin and gross profit dollars are impacted by, among other things, government actions, which typically seek to reduce the growth in prescription drug consumption, reduce reimbursement rates and increase generic drug utilization. A greater proportion of generic drugs, whether as a result of government actions, generic conversions or other factors, typically has an adverse effect on our revenues. However, in the wholesale division we typically earn equal or better gross margins on generic drugs than on branded drugs, although there are exceptions.

Changes in manufacturers  product distribution business models also can impact the division s sales and gross margin. For example, when pharmaceutical drug manufacturers introduce fee-for-service contracts, it reduces our sales even if we are successful in winning these contracts, as we only recognize sales for the amount of the fees charged. Other manufacturer services, including our pre-wholesale and contract logistics operations are typically on a fee-for-service basis.

In addition, performance as measured in U.S. dollars is impacted by the exchange rates used to translate these amounts into U.S. dollars, the exchange rate of British Pounds Sterling and the Euro being the most significant. The division s sales are subject to less seasonality than our other divisions.

Intellectual property and licenses 

We market products and services under various trademarks, trade dress and trade names and rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, and trade secret laws, as well as contractual restrictions to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We own numerous domain names, hold numerous patents, have registered numerous trademarks, and have filed applications for the registration of a number of our other trademarks and service marks in various jurisdictions. We hold assorted business licenses (such as pharmacy, occupational, liquor and cigarette) having various lives within multiple legal jurisdictions, which are necessary for the normal operation of our business.

Seasonal variations in business 

Our business is affected by a number of factors including, among others, our sales performance during holiday periods (including particularly the winter holiday season) and during the cough, cold and flu season (the timing and severity of which is difficult to predict), significant weather conditions, the timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions, and the timing of changes in levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers. See  Summary of Quarterly Results (Unaudited)  in the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below.

Sources and availability of raw materials 

Inventories are purchased from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers. We do not believe that the loss of any one supplier or group of suppliers under common control would have a material adverse effect on our business or that of any of our divisions.

Working capital practices 

Effective inventory management is important to our operations. We use various inventory management techniques, including demand forecasting and planning and various forms of replenishment management. Our working capital needs typically are greater in the months leading up to the winter holiday season. We generally finance our inventory and expansion needs with internally generated funds and short-term borrowings. For additional information, see the Liquidity and Capital Resources section in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 below.

Customers 

We sell to numerous retail and wholesale customers. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company s consolidated sales for any of the periods presented. Two payers    accounted for approximately  22 % of the Retail Pharmacy USA division s sales in fiscal 2016. One  payer  in the Retail Pharmacy International division accounted for approximately 18% of the division s sales in fiscal 2016.

Regulation 

In the countries in which we do business, we are subject to national, state and local laws, regulations, and administrative practices concerning retail and wholesale pharmacy operations, including regulations relating to our participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other publicly financed health benefit plans; regulations prohibiting kickbacks, beneficiary inducement and the submission of false claims; the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA  the ACA; licensure and registration requirements concerning the operation of pharmacies and the practice of pharmacy; and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as regulations promulgated by comparable foreign, state and local governmental authorities concerning the operation of our businesses. We are also subject to laws and regulations relating to licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions.

We are also governed by national, state and local laws of general applicability in the countries in which we do business, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity. In connection with the operation of our businesses, we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances. Environmental protection requirements did not have a material effect on our results of operations or capital expenditures in fiscal 2016.

Competitive conditions 

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. As a leader in the retail pharmacy industry and as a retailer of general merchandise, we compete with various local, regional, national and global retailers, including chain and independent pharmacies, mail order prescription providers, grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers. Our pharmaceutical wholesale  businesses compete  with other pharmaceutical wholesalers as well as alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. We compete primarily on the basis of service, convenience, variety and price. Our geographic dispersion helps mitigate the impact of temporary, localized economic and competitive conditions in individual markets. See  Properties  in Part I, Item 2 below for further information regarding our geographic dispersion.

Employees 

As of August 31, 2016, we employed approximately 360,000 persons, approximately 120,000 of whom were part-time employees working less than 30 hours per week. The foregoing does not include employees of unconsolidated partially-owned entities.

Research and development 

While our global brands portfolio is enhanced by our in-house product research and development capabilities, the amount we spend on research and development activities is not material.

Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sales 

Prior to completion of the Second Step Transaction, we accounted for our 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting and as a result, no Alliance Boots sales were included in our sales prior to December 31, 2014. All our sales in fiscal year 2014 occurred within the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Subsequent to the Second Step Transaction, Alliance Boots results have been fully consolidated. Certain financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations, including total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations, is included in Note 18, Segment Reporting to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 below, which information is incorporated herein by reference. See  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A below for information regarding risks attendant to our foreign operations.

Available Information 

We file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, as well as proxy statements and registration statements. You may read and copy any material we file with the SEC at the SEC s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. You may also obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically. We make available free of charge on or through our website at http://investor.walgreensbootsalliance.com our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them to the SEC. The contents of our website are not, however, a part of this Form 10-K or our other SEC filings.

Item 1A.       Risk Factors  

In addition to the other information in this report and our other filings with the SEC, you should carefully consider the risks described below, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are not the only risks that we face. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial.

Reductions in third party reimbursement levels, from private or governmental agency plans, and potential changes in industry pricing benchmarks for prescription drugs could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

The substantial majority of the prescriptions we fill are reimbursed by third party payers, including private and governmental agency payers. The continued efforts of health maintenance organizations, managed care organizations, pharmacy benefit management companies, governmental agencies, and other third party payers to reduce prescription drug costs and pharmacy reimbursement rates, as well as litigation and other legal proceedings relating to how drugs are priced, may adversely impact our results of operations. Changes in political, economic and regulatory influences also may significantly affect healthcare financing and prescription drug reimbursement practices. In the United States, plan changes with rate adjustments often occur in January and our reimbursement arrangements may provide for rate adjustments at prescribed intervals during their term. In addition, some of these entities may offer pricing terms that we may not be willing to accept or otherwise restrict our participation in their networks of pharmacy providers.

In the United States, for example, certain provisions of the ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010, enacted, subject to rulemaking, a modified average manufacturer price (used in the Medicaid rebate and reimbursement formula for multi-source drugs) and in January 2016 the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services finalized a rule implementing the modified AMP as well as a requirement that Medicaid reimburse pharmacies at actual acquisition cost rather than estimated acquisition cost. These changes, which states had until May 2016 to implement, generally are expected to reduce Medicaid reimbursements and adversely affect our operating results. There have also been a number of other proposals and enactments by the federal government and various states to reduce Medicare Part D and Medicaid reimbursement levels in response to budget deficits, and we expect additional proposals in the future. In addition, many payers in the United States are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price, and actual acquisition cost. It is possible that the pharmaceutical industry or regulators may evaluate and/or develop an alternative pricing reference to replace average wholesale price, which is the pricing reference used for many of our contracts. Future changes to the pricing benchmarks used to establish pharmaceutical pricing, including changes in the basis for calculating reimbursement by third party payers, could adversely affect us. There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies and practices will not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

In many countries in Europe and elsewhere, the government provides or subsidizes healthcare to consumers and regulates pharmaceutical prices, patient eligibility and reimbursement levels to control costs for the government-sponsored healthcare system. Efforts to control healthcare costs, including prescription drug costs, are continuous. 

A shift in pharmacy mix toward lower margin plans and programs could adversely affect our results of operations.

A shift in the mix of pharmacy prescription volume towards programs offering lower reimbursement rates could adversely affect our results of operations. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division continued to experience a shift in pharmacy mix towards 90-day at retail in fiscal 2016 and that trend may continue in fiscal 2017. Our 90-day at retail offering for patients with chronic prescription needs typically is at a lower margin than comparable 30-day prescriptions. Our Retail Pharmacy USA division also experienced a shift in pharmacy mix towards Medicare Part D prescriptions in fiscal 2016, and we expect that trend to continue in fiscal 2017.  Preferred  Medicare Part D networks have increased in number in recent years ; however,  we do not participate in all such networks. We have accepted lower reimbursement rates in order to secure preferred relationships with Medicare Part D plans serving senior patients with significant pharmacy needs. We also have worked to develop and expand our relationships with commercial third party payers to enable new and/or improved market access via participation in the pharmacy provider networks they offer. If we are not able to generate additional prescription volume and other business from patients participating in these programs that is sufficient to offset the impact of lower reimbursement, or if the degree or terms of our participation in such preferred networks declines from current levels in future years, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We could be adversely affected by a decrease in the introduction of new brand name and generic prescription drugs as well as increases in the cost to procure prescription drugs.

New brand name drugs can result in increased drug utilization and associated sales, while the introduction of lower priced generic alternatives typically results in relatively lower sales, but relatively higher gross profit margins. Accordingly, a decrease in the number or magnitude of significant new brand name drugs or generics successfully introduced, or delays in their introduction, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

In addition, if we experience an increase in the amounts we pay to procure pharmaceutical drugs, including generic drugs, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our gross profit margins would be adversely affected to the extent we are not able to offset such cost increases. Any failure to fully offset any such increased prices and costs or to modify our activities to mitigate the impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, any future changes in drug prices could be significantly different than our projections.

We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed by pharmacy benefit management companies.

We derive a significant portion of our sales in the United States from prescription drug sales reimbursed through prescription drug plans administered by PBM companies. PBM companies typically administer multiple prescription drug plans that expire at various times and provide for varying reimbursement rates, and often limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication. There can be no assurance that we will continue to participate in any particular PBM company s pharmacy provider network in any particular future time period. If our participation in the pharmacy provider network for a prescription drug plan administered by one or more of the large PBM companies is restricted or terminated, we expect that our sales would be adversely affected, at least in the short-term. If we are unable to replace any such lost sales, either through an increase in other sales or through a resumption of participation in those plans, our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If we exit a pharmacy provider network and later resume participation, there can be no assurance that we will achieve any particular level of business on any particular pace, or that all clients of the PBM company will choose to include us again in the pharmacy network for their plans, initially or at all. In addition, in such circumstances we may incur increased marketing and other costs in connection with initiatives to regain former patients and attract new patients covered by such plans.

Consolidation and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business operations, competitive positioning, financial condition and results of operations.

Many organizations in the healthcare industry, including PBM companies and health insurance companies, have consolidated in recent years to create larger healthcare enterprises with greater bargaining power, which has resulted in greater pricing pressures. For example, in July 2015, OptumRx, UnitedHealth Group s pharmacy care services business, completed its combination with Catamaran Corporation, with the combined businesses becoming the third largest PBM company in the United States. In addition, significant business combinations within the health insurance industry are currently pending, including the transactions contemplated by Anthem, Inc. s agreement to acquire Cigna Corporation, and Aetna, Inc. s agreement to acquire Humana Inc. If these pending transactions are completed, the resulting enterprises are expected to be two of the three largest health insurers in the United States. If this consolidation trend continues, it could give the resulting enterprises even greater bargaining power, which may lead to further pressure on the prices for our products and services. If these pressures result in reductions in our prices, our businesses would become less profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding reductions in costs.

New partnerships and strategic alliances in the healthcare industry also can alter market dynamics and impact our businesses and competitive positioning. For example, following the announcement of our agreement with AmerisourceBergen providing for, among other things, generic drug purchasing through WBAD, our global sourcing enterprise, some of our retail pharmacy competitors subsequently established relationships with other pharmaceutical drug wholesalers relating to generic drug procurement. In addition, further consolidation among generic drug manufacturers could lead to generic drug inflation in the future. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and other pressures will continue to cause the healthcare industry to evolve, potentially resulting in further business consolidations and alliances and increased vertical integration among the industry participants we engage with, and which could, if we are not able to successfully anticipate and respond to evolving industry conditions in a timely and effective manner, materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

Our growth strategy is partially dependent upon our ability to identify and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances.

A significant element of our growth strategy is to identify, pursue and successfully complete acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances that either expand or complement our existing operations. We have grown significantly through acquisitions in recent years and expect to continue to acquire, partner with or invest in businesses that build on or are deemed complementary to our existing businesses or further our strategic objectives. Due in part to consolidation in the industries in which we compete, there is significant competition for attractive targets and opportunities when available. There can be no assurance that attractive acquisition or other strategic relationship opportunities will be available, that we will be successful in identifying, negotiating and consummating favorable transaction opportunities, or that any such transactions we complete will be successful and justify our investment of financial and other resources therein.

Acquisitions and other strategic transactions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in successfully integrating the operations and personnel, distraction of management from overseeing, and disruption of, our existing operations, difficulties in entering markets or lines of business in which we have no or limited direct prior experience, the possible loss of key employees and customers, and difficulties in achieving the synergies we anticipated. Any failure to select suitable opportunities at fair prices, conduct appropriate due diligence and successfully integrate the acquired company, including particularly when acquired businesses operate in new geographic markets or areas of business, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. These transactions may also cause us to significantly increase our interest expense, leverage and debt service requirements if we incur additional debt to pay for an acquisition or investment, issue common stock that would dilute our current stockholders  percentage ownership, or incur asset write-offs and restructuring costs and other related expenses that could have a material adverse impact on our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments also involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to assumed litigation and unknown environmental and other liabilities, as well as undetected internal control, regulatory or other issues, or additional costs not anticipated at the time the transaction was completed. No assurance can be given that our acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic alliances will be successful and will not materially adversely affect our business operations, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to successfully identify, complete and integrate acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic investments in a timely and effective manner, our business operations and growth strategies could be negatively affected.

We may not be able to successfully or timely complete the pending acquisition of Rite Aid.

Risks and uncertainties related to our pending acquisition of Rite Aid include, among others: the occurrence of any event, change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement including that regulatory or other approvals required for the transaction are not obtained; that litigation may be filed which could prevent or delay the transaction; and that uncertainty regarding the transaction may adversely affect our and Rite Aid s relationships with suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties with which we or Rite Aid do business.

Completion of the transaction is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including the expiration or termination of applicable waiting periods (and any extensions thereof) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, no material adverse effect having occurred with respect to Rite Aid prior to the closing of the transaction, and other customary conditions. We will be unable to complete the pending acquisition of Rite Aid until each of the conditions to closing is either satisfied or waived. In deciding whether or not to object to the transaction, regulatory agencies have broad discretion in administering the applicable governing regulations. As a condition to their approval of the transaction, these agencies may impose requirements, limitations or costs or require divestitures or place restrictions on the conduct of our business after consummation of the transaction. These requirements, limitations, costs, divestitures or restrictions may be burdensome to complete, increase our costs, reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and materially and adversely affect our results of operations after the closing of the transaction. We can provide no assurance that we will obtain the necessary approvals on any particular timetable or at all, or that any such conditions that are imposed would not diminish the anticipated benefits of the transaction or result in the termination of the transaction. In the event that the transaction is not completed due to the failure to obtain antitrust clearance, we could be required to pay Rite Aid a termination fee of $325 million or $650 million in certain circumstances.

While our acquisition of Rite Aid is pending, it creates uncertainty that may adversely affect our and Rite Aid s respective businesses and results of operations, including with respect to relationships with suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties.  We  have incurred and will continue to incur significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the pending transaction, as well as the diversion of management resources, for which we will receive little or no benefit if the closing of the transaction does not occur.  Further, in the event that such merger is not consummated on or prior to June 1, 2017 or if the Merger Agreement is terminated at any time on or prior to June 1, 2017, then we would be required to redeem $3.5 billion aggregate principal amount of notes of various interest rates and maturities on the date described in the applicable note at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. See  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources  for additional information 

If we complete our pending acquisition of Rite Aid, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction, which could adversely impact our results of operations.

We entered into the Merger Agreement to acquire Rite Aid with the expectation that the transaction will result in various benefits, including, among other things, cost savings and operating efficiencies. The achievement of the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of uncertainties, including whether Rite Aid s business can be integrated into ours in an efficient and effective manner, the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace. If the Rite Aid transaction is completed, we can provide no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the transaction, including cost savings and synergies, will be fully realized in the time frame anticipated or at all; the costs or difficulties related to the integration of Rite Aid s business and operations into ours will not be greater than expected; unanticipated costs, charges and expenses will not result from the transaction; litigation relating to the transaction will not be filed; we will be able to retain key personnel; and the transaction will not cause disruption to the parties  business and operations and relationships with employees and suppliers, payers, customers and other third parties. If one or more of these risks are realized, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results.

Table of Contents 

We could also encounter unforeseen transaction and integration-related costs or other circumstances, such as unforeseen liabilities or other issues existing or arising with respect to the business of Rite Aid or otherwise resulting from the transaction. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention, which could adversely impact our agility to respond to market opportunities and our ability to timely identify and implement other strategic actions. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we have incurred significant transaction costs related to the acquisition and, if the pending transaction is consummated, we will continue to incur significant integration and related costs as we integrate the Rite Aid businesses. These integration and acquisition-related costs, including legal, accounting, financial and tax advisory and other fees and costs, may be higher than expected and some of these costs may be material.

Our substantial operations outside of the United States subject us to a number of operating, economic, political, regulatory and other international business risks.

Our substantial international business operations are important to our growth and prospects, including particularly those of our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions, and are subject to a number of risks, including:

compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including retail and wholesale pharmacy, licensing, tax, foreign trade, intellectual property, privacy and data protection, currency, political and other business restrictions and requirements and local laws and regulations, whose interpretation and enforcement vary significantly among jurisdictions and can change significantly over time;

additional U.S. and other regulation of non-domestic operations, including regulation under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other anti-corruption laws;

potential difficulties in managing foreign operations, mitigating credit risks in foreign markets, enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;

price controls imposed by foreign countries;

tariffs, duties or other restrictions on foreign currencies or trade sanctions and other trade barriers imposed by foreign countries that restrict or prohibit business transactions in certain markets;

potential adverse tax consequences, including tax withholding laws and policies and restrictions on repatriation of funds to the United States;

fluctuations in currency exchange rates, including uncertainty regarding the Euro;

impact of recessions and economic slowdowns in economies outside the United States, including foreign currency devaluation, higher interest rates, inflation, and increased government regulation or ownership of traditional private businesses;

the instability of foreign economies, governments and currencies and unexpected regulatory, economic or political changes in foreign markets; and

developing and emerging markets may be especially vulnerable to periods of instability and unexpected changes, and consumers in those markets may have relatively limited resources to spend on products and services.

These factors can also adversely affect our payers, vendors and customers in international markets, which in turn can negatively impact our businesses. We cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operation and financial condition.

Our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions have substantial operations in the United Kingdom and other member countries of the European Union. On June 23, 2016, voters in the United Kingdom approved an advisory referendum to withdraw from the European Union, which proposed exit (and the political, economic and other uncertainties it has raised) has exacerbated and may further exacerbate many of the risks and uncertainties described above. Negotiations on withdrawal and post-exit arrangements likely will be complex and protracted, and there can be no assurance regarding the terms, timing or consummation of any such arrangements. The proposed withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our businesses in the region are subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties. Further, uncertainty around these and related issues could lead to adverse effects on the economy of the United Kingdom and the other economies in which we operate. There can be no assurance that any or all of these events will not have a material adverse effect on our business operations, results of operations and financial condition.

We are exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

Our significant operations outside of the United States expose us to currency exchange rate fluctuations and related risks, including transaction currency exposures relating to the import and export of goods in currencies other than businesses  functional currencies as well as currency translation exposures relating to profits and net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We present our financial statements in U.S. dollars and have a significant proportion of net assets and income in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily British Pounds Sterling and the Euro, as well as a range of other foreign currencies. Our results of operations and capital ratios can therefore be sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates. Due to the constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future results of operations. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform period-to-period comparisons of our reported results of operations. A depreciation of non-U.S. dollar currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations.

We may from time to time, in some instances, enter into foreign currency contracts or other derivative instruments intended to hedge a portion of our foreign currency fluctuation risks, which subjects us to additional risks ,  such as the risk that counterparties may fail to honor their obligations to us , that could materially and adversely affect us.  Additionally, we may (and currently do) use foreign currency borrowings to hedge some of our foreign currency fluctuation risks. The periodic use of such hedging activities may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates over the limited time the hedges are in place. We cannot assure you that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, will not materially affect our consolidated financial results.

Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage ongoing organizational change and achieve cost savings and operating efficiency initiatives.

Our Board of Directors approved the plan to implement the Cost Transformation Program described in MD A in Part II, Item 7 below as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. There can be no assurance that we will realize, in full or in part, the anticipated benefits of this program. Our financial goals assume a level of productivity improvement, including those reflected in our Cost Transformation Program and other business optimization initiatives. If we are unable to deliver these expected productivity improvements, while continuing to invest in business growth, or if the volume and nature of change overwhelms available resources, our business operations and financial results could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to successfully manage and execute these initiatives and realize expected savings and benefits in the amounts and at the times anticipated is important to our business success. Any failure to do so, which could result from our inability to successfully execute plans, changes in global or regional economic conditions, competition, changes in the industries in which we compete, unanticipated costs or charges, loss of key personnel and other factors described herein, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition and results of operations.

Disruption in our global supply chain could negatively impact our businesses.

The products we sell are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international vendors, and any future disruption in our supply chain or inability to find qualified vendors and access products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner could adversely impact our businesses. The loss or disruption of such supply arrangements for any reason, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, the supplier s financial distress, natural disasters, civil unrest or acts of war or terrorism or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which Walgreens sources branded and generic pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen in the U.S. and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through WBAD, our global sourcing enterprise. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026. In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergen s board of directors in certain circumstances. As of the date of this report, AmerisourceBergen distributes for our Retail Pharmacy USA division all branded pharmaceutical products that Walgreens historically sourced from suppliers and distributors as well as substantially all generic pharmaceutical products that previously were self-distributed. Consequently, our business in the United States may be adversely affected by any operational, financial or regulatory difficulties that AmerisourceBergen experiences. For example, if AmerisourceBergen s operations are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether due to a natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory action, computer or operational systems or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business in the United States and our results of operations.

Our distribution agreement with AmerisourceBergen is subject to early termination in certain circumstances and, upon the expiration or termination of the agreement, there can be no assurance that we or AmerisourceBergen will be willing to renew the agreement or enter into a new agreement, on terms favorable to us or at all. If such expiration or termination occurred, we believe that alternative sources of supply for most generic and brand-name pharmaceuticals are readily available and that we could obtain and qualify alternative sources, which may include resuming self-distribution in some cases, for substantially all of the prescription drugs we sell on an acceptable basis, such that the impact of any expiration or termination would be temporary. However, there can be no assurance we would be able to engage alternative supply sources or implement self-distribution processes on a timely basis or on terms favorable to us, or effectively manage these transitions, any of which could adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

The anticipated strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen may not be realized.

We entered into the arrangement with AmerisourceBergen with the expectation that the transactions contemplated thereby would result in various benefits including, among other things, procurement cost savings and operating efficiencies, innovation and sharing of best practices. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve these potential benefits are complex, costly and time-consuming. Many of the anticipated synergies and expenses that will be incurred, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately at the present time. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations, processes or initiatives, or the inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits and synergies, whether unique corporate cultures of separate organizations will work collaboratively in an efficient and effective manner, unforeseen expenses or delays, and competitive factors in the marketplace.

As of August 31, 2016, we beneficially owned approximately 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors. In addition, we have the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework Agreement dated as of March 18, 2013 by and among the Company, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen (the  Framework Agreement ) to acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. There can be no assurance that we will complete any specific level of such potential equity investments in AmerisourceBergen, or that our existing investment, or any future investment if completed, will ultimately be profitable. If the price of AmerisourceBergen common stock subsequently declines substantially, we could experience a loss on or impairment of such investment, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities is subject to certain restrictions set forth in our agreements with AmerisourceBergen and arising under applicable laws and regulations, which in some circumstances could adversely our ability to transact in AmerisourceBergen securities in amounts and at the times desired. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances or issues existing or arising with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate resulting from the Framework Agreement. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased synergies and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve our objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

From time to time, we make investments in companies over which we do not have sole control, including our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Some of these companies may operate in sectors that differ from our current operations and have different risks.

From time to time, we make debt or equity investments in other companies that we may not control or over which we may not have sole control. For example, while we have a significant equity investment in AmerisourceBergen and have a designee serving on the board of directors of AmerisourceBergen as of the date of this report, we do not and will not have the ability to control day-to-day operations of that company. Although the businesses in which we have made non-controlling investments often have a significant health and daily living or prescription drug component, some of them operate in businesses that are different from our primary lines of business and/or operate in different geographic markets than we do. Investments in these businesses, among other risks, subject us to the operating and financial risks of the businesses we invest in and to the risk that we do not have sole control over the operations of these businesses. We rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may materially and adversely affect us. Investments in entities over which we do not have sole control, including joint ventures and strategic alliances, present additional risks such as having differing objectives from our partners or the entities in which we are invested, becoming involved in disputes, or competing with those persons. From time to time, we may make additional investments in or acquire other entities that may subject us to similar risks.

Changes in economic conditions could adversely affect consumer buying practices.

Our performance has been, and may continue to be, adversely impacted by changes in global, national, regional or local economic conditions and consumer confidence. These conditions can also adversely affect our key vendors and customers. External factors that affect consumer confidence and over which we exercise no influence include unemployment rates, levels of personal disposable income, levels of taxes and interest and global, national, regional or local economic conditions, as well as acts of war or terrorism. Changes in economic conditions and consumer confidence could adversely affect consumer preferences, purchasing power and spending patterns, which could lead to a decrease in overall consumer spending. In addition, reduced or flat consumer spending may drive us and our competitors to offer additional products at promotional prices. All of these factors could materially and adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

Economic conditions in Europe and certain emerging market countries, together with austerity measures being taken by certain governments, could adversely affect us.

We have significant assets and operations within Europe and certain emerging market countries in our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale divisions. An economic slowdown within any such markets could adversely affect our businesses in affected regions by reducing the prices our customers may be able or willing to pay for our products and services or by reducing the demand for our products and services, either of which could result in a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In recent years, in response to the economic environment, a number of governments have announced or implemented austerity measures to reduce healthcare spending for the government-sponsored healthcare system and constrain overall government expenditures. These measures, which include efforts aimed at reforming healthcare coverage and reducing healthcare costs, continue to exert pressure on the pricing of and reimbursement timelines for pharmaceutical drugs. Countries with existing austerity measures may impose additional laws, regulations, or requirements on the healthcare industry. In addition, governments that have not yet imposed austerity measures may impose them in the future. Any new austerity measures may be similar to or vary in scope and nature from existing austerity measures and could have a material adverse effect on our international business operations and results of operations.

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and constantly evolving. New entrants to the market, existing competitor actions, or other changes in market dynamics could adversely impact us.

The level of competition among retail pharmacies and pharmaceutical wholesalers is high. Changes in market dynamics or actions of competitors or manufacturers, including industry consolidation and the emergence of new competitors and strategic alliances, could materially and adversely impact us. Disruptive innovation by existing or new competitors could alter the competitive landscape in the future and require us to accurately identify and assess such changes and make timely and effective changes to our strategies and business model to compete effectively. Our retail pharmacy businesses face intense competition from local, regional, national and global companies, including other drugstore and pharmacy chains, independent drugstores and pharmacies, mail-order prescription providers and various other retailers such as grocery stores, convenience stores, mass merchants, online and omni-channel pharmacies and retailers, warehouse clubs, dollar stores and other discount merchandisers, some of which are aggressively expanding in markets we serve. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division face intense competition from direct competitors, including national and regional cooperative wholesalers, and alternative supply sources such as importers and manufacturers who supply directly to pharmacies. Competition may also come from other sources in the future. As competition increases in the markets in which we operate, a significant increase in general pricing pressures could occur, which could require us to reevaluate our pricing structures to remain competitive. For example, if we are not able to anticipate and successfully respond to changes in market conditions in our  Pharmaceutical Wholesale  division, including changes driven by competitors, suppliers or manufacturers and increased competition from national and regional cooperative wholesalers, it could result in a loss of customers or renewal of contracts or arrangements on less favorable terms.

We also could be adversely affected if we fail to identify or effectively respond to changes in market dynamics.  For example, specialty pharmacy represents a significant and growing proportion of prescription drug spending in the United States, a significant portion of which is dispensed outside of traditional retail pharmacies. Because our specialty pharmacy business focuses on complex and high-cost medications that serve a relatively limited universe of patients, the future growth of this business depends to a significant extent upon expanding our ability to access key drugs and successfully penetrate key treatment categories. If we are not able to compete effectively in this evolving market, it could have an adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

If the merchandise and services that we offer fail to meet customer needs, our sales may be adversely affected.

We could be adversely affected by changes in consumer spending levels and shopping habits and preferences, including attitudes towards our retail and product brands. The success of our retail pharmacy businesses depends on our ability to offer a superior shopping experience, engaging customer service and a quality assortment of available merchandise that differentiates us from other retailers, including enhanced health and beauty product offerings. We must identify, obtain supplies of, and offer to our customers attractive, innovative and high-quality merchandise on a continuous basis. Our products and services must satisfy the needs and desires of our customers, whose preferences may change in the future. It is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand. If we misjudge either the demand for products and services we sell or our customers  purchasing habits and tastes, we may be faced with excess inventories of some products and missed opportunities for products and services we chose not to offer. In addition, our sales may decline or we may be required to sell the merchandise we have obtained at lower prices. Failure to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and spending patterns and evolving demographic mixes in the markets we serve could negatively affect our relationship with our customers and the demand for our products and services, which could materially and adversely impact our results of operations.

Our private brand offerings expose us to various additional risks.

In addition to brand name products, we offer our customers private brand products that are not available from other retailers. We seek to continue to grow our exclusive private brand offerings as part of our growth strategy, including through the expanded offering of No7 and other brands owned or licensed on an exclusive basis, as well as through selective acquisitions. Maintaining consistent product quality, competitive pricing, and availability of our private brand offerings for our customers, as well as the timely development and introduction of new products, is important in differentiating us from other retailers and developing and maintaining customer loyalty. Although we believe that our private brand products offer value to our customers and typically provide us with higher gross margins than comparable national brand products we sell, the expansion of our private brand offerings also subjects us to additional risks, such as potential product liability risks and mandatory or voluntary product recalls; our ability to successfully protect our proprietary rights and successfully navigate and avoid claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; our ability to successfully administer and comply with applicable contractual obligations and regulatory requirements; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. An increase in sales of our private brands may also adversely affect sales of our vendors  products, which, in turn, could adversely affect our relationship with certain of our vendors. Any failure to adequately address some or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business operations, results of operations and financial condition.

If we do not successfully develop and maintain a relevant omni-channel experience for our customers, our businesses and results of operations could be adversely impacted.

Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. Omni-channel retailing is rapidly evolving and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. For example, in July 2016, we announced that we would cease operations at our drugstore.com and  beauty .com properties in furtherance of our omni-channel strategy and initiatives to greater focus on the development of  walgreens .com  in the United States . Our customers are increasingly using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices to comparison shop, determine product availability and complete purchases online. We must compete by offering a consistent and convenient shopping experience for our customers regardless of the ultimate sales channel and by investing in, providing and maintaining digital tools for our customers that have the right features and are reliable and easy to use. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if our online activities or our other customer-facing technology systems do not function as designed, we may experience a loss of customer confidence, data security breaches, lost sales, or be exposed to fraudulent purchases, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, reputation and results of operations.

We may be constrained if we are unable to find suitable new store locations at acceptable prices or by the terms of our current leases.

Our ability to grow our retail pharmacy businesses may be constrained if suitable new store locations cannot be identified with lease terms or purchase prices that are acceptable to us. We compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores. Local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and influence the cost of constructing our stores. The termination or expiration of leases at existing store locations may adversely affect us if the renewal terms of those leases are unacceptable to us and we are forced to close or relocate stores. Further, changing local demographics at existing store locations may adversely affect revenue and profitability levels at those stores.

We may experience a significant disruption in our computer systems.

We rely extensively on our computer systems to manage our ordering, pricing, point-of-sale, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory replenishment, customer loyalty programs, finance and other processes. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, natural disasters, catastrophic events and human error, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. If any of our systems are damaged, fail to function properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and may experience loss or corruption of critical data and interruptions or disruptions and delays in our ability to perform critical functions, which could materially and adversely affect our businesses and results of operations. In addition, we are currently making, and expect to continue to make, substantial investments in our information technology systems and infrastructure, some of which are significant. Upgrades involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. Implementing new systems carries significant potential risks, including failure to operate as designed, potential loss or corruption of data or information, cost overruns, implementation delays, disruption of operations, and the potential inability to meet business and reporting requirements. While we are aware of inherent risks associated with replacing these systems and believe we are taking reasonable action to mitigate known risks, there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant issues with our existing systems prior to implementation, that our technology initiatives will be successfully deployed as planned or that they will be timely implemented without significant disruption to our operations. We also could be adversely affected by any significant disruption in the systems of third parties we interact with, including key payers and vendors.

If we or the businesses we interact with do not maintain the privacy and security of sensitive customer and business information, it could damage our reputation and we could suffer a loss of revenue, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and regulatory scrutiny.

The protection of customer, employee, and company data is critical to our businesses. Cybersecurity and other information technology security risks, such as a significant breach of customer, employee, or company data, could attract a substantial amount of media attention, damage our customer relationships and reputation, and result in lost sales, fines or lawsuits. Throughout our operations, we receive, retain and transmit certain personal information that our customers and others provide to purchase products or services, fill prescriptions, enroll in promotional programs, participate in our customer loyalty programs, register on our websites, or otherwise communicate and interact with us. In addition, aspects of our operations depend upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Although we deploy a layered approach to address information security threats and vulnerabilities designed to protect confidential information against data security breaches, a compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with whom we interact, which results in confidential information being accessed, obtained, damaged or used by unauthorized or improper persons, could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers, financial institutions, payment card associations and other persons, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, a security breach could require that we expend substantial additional resources related to the security of information systems and disrupt our businesses.

The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations in the United States and in other countries in which we operate that regulate the collection, use and transfer of personal data, including the transfer of personal data between or among countries. Some foreign data privacy regulations are more stringent than those in the United States and continue to change. For example, in May 2016 the General Data Protection Regulation was formally published in the Journal of the European Union and comes into effect in May 2018. Complying with these and other changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs and require us to change our business practices in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business operations and operating results. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. Compliance with changes in privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes. If we or those with whom we share information fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a data security breach, our reputation could be damaged and we could be subject to additional litigation and regulatory risks. Our security measures may be undermined due to the actions of outside parties, employee error, malfeasance, or otherwise, and, as a result, an unauthorized party may obtain access to our data systems and misappropriate business and personal information. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Any such breach or unauthorized access could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage to our reputation, and potentially have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to payment-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud or theft, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business operations.

We accept payments using a variety of methods, including cash, checks, credit and debit cards, gift cards and mobile payment technologies such as Apple Pay , and we may offer new payment options over time. Acceptance of these payment options subjects us to rules, regulations, contractual obligations and compliance requirements, including payment network rules and operating guidelines, data security standards and certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers. These requirements and related interpretations may change over time, which could make compliance more difficult or costly. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which could increase over time and raise our operating costs. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, and other forms of electronic payment. If these companies become unable to provide these services to us, or if their systems are compromised, it could disrupt our business. The payment methods that we offer also subject us to potential fraud and theft by persons who seek to obtain unauthorized access to or exploit any weaknesses that may exist in the payment systems. If we fail to comply with applicable rules or requirements, or if data is compromised due to a breach or misuse of data relating to our payment systems, we may be liable for costs incurred by payment card issuing banks and other third parties or subject to fines and higher transaction fees, or our ability to accept or facilitate certain types of payments could be impaired. In addition, our reputation could suffer and our customers could lose confidence in certain payment types, which could result in higher costs and/or reduced sales and materially and adversely affect our results of operations.

Changes in healthcare regulatory environments may adversely affect our businesses.

Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to significant changes that could adversely affect our results of operations. In recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare and Medicaid funding in the United States and the funding of governmental payers in foreign jurisdictions; consolidation of competitors, suppliers and other market participants; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding for certain healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause customers to reduce the amount of our products and services they purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued governmental and private payer pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers  pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability.

The ACA was enacted in 2010 to provide health insurance coverage to millions of previously uninsured Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies and health insurance mandates. While certain provisions of the ACA have already taken effect, others have delayed effective dates or require further rulemaking action or regulatory guidance by governmental agencies to implement. In addition, various market participants continue to react to these regulatory changes. As a result, there remains uncertainty as to the full impact of ACA on our business operations. Future rulemaking or other regulatory actions under the ACA or otherwise could increase regulation of pharmacy services, result in changes to pharmacy reimbursement rates, and otherwise change the way we do business. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or other regulatory actions, but any such actions could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

A significant change in, or noncompliance with, governmental regulations and other legal requirements could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and profitability.

We operate in complex, highly regulated environments in the United States and in the other countries in which we operate and could be adversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements, new legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations. Businesses in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division are subject to a range of regulations relating to such things as product margins, product traceability and the conditions under which products must be stored. Our retail pharmacy and health and wellness services businesses are subject to numerous country, state and local regulations including licensing and other requirements for pharmacies and reimbursement arrangements. The regulations to which we are subject include, but are not limited to: country, and state registration and regulation of pharmacies and drug discount card programs; dispensing and sale of controlled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; applicable governmental payer regulations including Medicare and Medicaid; data privacy and security laws and regulations including HIPAA; the ACA; laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; regulations regarding food and drug safety including those of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and Drug Enforcement Administration ( DEA ), trade regulations including those of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, and consumer protection and safety regulations including those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, as well as state regulatory authorities, governing the availability, sale, advertisement and promotion of products we sell; anti-kickback laws; false claims laws; laws against the corporate practice of medicine; and foreign, national and state laws governing the practice of the profession of pharmacy. For example, in the United States the DEA, FDA and various other regulatory authorities regulate the distribution and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substance Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, dispensing, disposal, holding and distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations. We are also governed by foreign, national and state laws of general applicability, including laws regulating matters of working conditions, health and safety and equal employment opportunity and other labor and employment matters as well as competition and antitrust matters. In addition, we could have significant exposure if we are found to have infringed another party s intellectual property rights.

Changes in laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may alter the landscape in which we do business and may affect our costs of doing business. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices generally cannot be predicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our operating costs and require significant capital expenditures. Untimely compliance or noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations could result in the imposition of civil and criminal penalties that could adversely affect the continued operation of our businesses, including:  suspension of payments from government programs; loss of required government certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs in the United States and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom; loss of licenses; and significant fines or monetary penalties. Any failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial exposure, damage our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

We could be adversely affected by product liability, product recall, personal injury or other health and safety issues.

We could be adversely impacted by the supply of defective products, including the infiltration of counterfeit products into the supply chain, errors in re-labelling of products, product tampering, product recall and contamination or product mishandling issues. Through our pharmacies and specialist packaging sites, we are also exposed to risks relating to the services we provide. Errors in the dispensing and packaging of pharmaceuticals could lead to serious injury or death. Product liability or personal injury claims may be asserted against us with respect to any of the products or pharmaceuticals we sell or services we provide. Our healthcare clinics also increase our exposure to professional liability claims related to medical care. Should a product or other liability issue arise, the coverage limits under our insurance programs and the indemnification amounts available to us may not be adequate to protect us against claims and judgments. We also may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future. We could suffer significant reputational damage and financial liability if we, or any affiliated entities, experience any of the foregoing health and safety issues or incidents, which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.

We have significant outstanding debt; our debt and associated payment obligations could significantly increase in the future if we incur additional debt and do not retire existing debt.

We have outstanding debt and other financial obligations and significant unused borrowing capacity. As of August 31, 2016, we had approximately $19 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including short-term borrowings. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:

requiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal, interest and other amounts payable on our debt, which would reduce the funds we have available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends;

making it more difficult or expensive for us to obtain any necessary future financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, debt refinancing, acquisitions or other purposes;

reducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our industry and market conditions;

making us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business operations; and

exposing us to interest rate risk given that a portion of our debt obligations is at variable interest rates.

We may incur or assume significantly more debt in the future, including in connection with acquisitions, strategic investments or joint ventures. For example, we incurred significant additional debt in November 2014 in connection with the Second Step Transaction and in June 2016 as part of our intended financing for the pending Rite Aid transaction. We will incur significant additional debt upon the closing of the pending Rite Aid transaction including pursuant to the 2015 Credit Agreements. See Note 9, Borrowings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our financing plans and arrangements. In addition, if the pending acquisition of Rite Aid is completed, the then-outstanding Rite Aid indebtedness we acquire upon closing is expected to be substantial. If we add new debt and do not retire existing debt, the risks described above could increase. We also could be adversely impacted by any failure to renew or replace, on terms acceptable to us or at all, existing funding arrangements when they expire, and any failure to satisfy applicable covenants.

Our long-term debt obligations include covenants that may adversely affect our ability, and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries, to incur certain secured indebtedness or engage in certain types of transactions. In addition, our existing credit agreements require us to maintain as of the last day of each fiscal quarter a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed a certain level. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. This could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial condition.

We could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access well-functioning capital markets.

We could be adversely affected by downgrades to our credit ratings or disruptions in our ability to access well-functioning capital markets.

Historically, we have relied on the public debt capital markets to fund portions of our capital investments and access to the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities as part of our working capital management strategy. Our continued access to these markets, and the terms of such access, depend on multiple factors including the condition of debt capital markets, our operating performance, and our credit ratings. The major credit rating agencies have assigned us and our corporate debt investment grade credit ratings. These ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength and financial policies. We benefit from investment grade ratings as they serve to lower our borrowing costs and facilitate our access to a variety of lenders and other creditors, including landlords for our leased stores, on terms that we consider advantageous to our businesses. However, there can be no assurance that any particular rating assigned to us will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency, if in that rating agency s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Incurrence of additional debt by us, including, if the pending acquisition of Rite Aid is completed, outstanding Rite Aid indebtedness we acquire upon closing and additional debt we incur in connection with the financing of the transaction, could adversely affect our credit ratings.  We depend on banks and other financial institutions to provide credit to our business and perform under our agreements with them. Defaults by one or more of these counterparties on their obligations to us could materially and adversely affect us.  Any disruptions or turmoil in the capital markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets and increase the cost of  and counterparty risks associated with  existing facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

As a holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance is dependent on funding from its operating subsidiaries to pay dividends and other obligations.

Walgreens Boots Alliance is a holding company with no business operations of its own. Its assets primarily consist of direct and indirect ownership interests in, and its business is conducted through, subsidiaries which are separate legal entities. As a result, it is dependent on funding from its subsidiaries, including Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to meet its obligations. Additionally, Walgreens Boots Alliance s subsidiaries may be restricted in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions to Walgreens Boots Alliance, which may limit the payment of cash dividends or other distributions to the holders of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Credit facilities and other debt obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance, as well as statutory provisions, may further limit the ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries to pay dividends. Payments to Walgreens Boots Alliance by its subsidiaries are also contingent upon its subsidiaries  earnings and business considerations.

Our quarterly results may fluctuate significantly.

Our operating results have historically varied on a quarterly basis and may continue to fluctuate significantly in the future. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, some of which are beyond the control of management, include, but are not limited to the timing of the introduction of new generic and brand name prescription drugs; inflation, including with respect to generic drug procurement costs; the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season; changes in payer reimbursement rates and terms; fluctuations in inventory, energy, transportation, labor, healthcare and other costs; significant acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives; asset impairment charges; the relative magnitude of our LIFO provision in any particular quarter; foreign currency fluctuations; seasonality; prolonged severe weather in key markets; and many of the other risk factors discussed herein. Accordingly, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and investors should not rely on the results of any particular quarter as an indication of our future performance.

Our businesses are seasonal in nature, and adverse events during the holiday and cough, cold and flu seasons could adversely impact our operating results.

Our businesses are seasonal in nature, with the second fiscal quarter (December, January and February) typically generating a higher proportion of retail sales and earnings than other fiscal quarters. We purchase significant amounts of seasonal inventory in anticipation of the holiday season. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, higher unemployment, higher gas prices, public transportation disruptions, or unanticipated adverse weather, could result in lower-than-planned sales during key selling seasons. For example, frequent or unusually heavy snowfall, ice storms, rainstorms, windstorms or other extreme weather conditions over a prolonged period could make it difficult for our customers to travel to our stores and increase our snow removal and other costs. This could lead to lower sales or to unanticipated markdowns, negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, both prescription and non-prescription drug sales are affected by the timing and severity of the cough, cold and flu season, which can vary considerably from year to year.

We could be adversely impacted by changes in accounting standards and subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by management related to complex accounting matters.

Generally  Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP )  and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our businesses, including, but not limited to, revenue recognition, asset impairment, impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, inventories, vendor rebates and other vendor consideration, lease obligations, self-insurance liabilities, tax matters, unclaimed property laws and litigation and other contingent liabilities are highly complex and involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance or financial condition. For example, changes in accounting standards and the application of existing accounting standards particularly related to the measurement of fair value as compared to carrying value for the Company s reporting units, including goodwill, intangible assets and investments in equity interests, including investments held by our equity method investees, may have an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include significant adverse changes in the business climate and declines in the financial condition of a reporting unit. Factors that could lead to impairment of investments in equity interests of the companies in which we invested or the investments held by those companies include a prolonged period of decline in their operating performance or adverse changes in the economic, regulatory and legal environments of the countries in which they operate in.

New accounting guidance also may require systems and other changes that could increase our operating costs and/or significantly change our financial statements. For example, in February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued  Accounting Standards Update (  ASU  )  2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. This ASU, which is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020), seeks to increase the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. See,  New Accounting Pronouncements,  within Note 2, Summary of Major Accounting Policies .  Implementing this ASU, as well as other future accounting guidance such as that related to revenue and other areas impacted by the current convergence project between the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board could require us to make significant changes to our lease management system or other accounting systems, and could result in significant adverse changes to our financial statements.

We have a substantial amount of goodwill and other intangible assets which could, in the future, become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations.

As of August 31, 2016, we had $25.8 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets, most of which relates to the acquisition of Alliance Boots completed on December 31, 2014. We accounted for the Second Step Transaction using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with GAAP, with the purchase price paid allocated to recognize the acquired assets and liabilities at their fair value. At least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the carrying value as defined by GAAP, we will evaluate this goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount. Estimated fair values could change if, for example, there are changes in the business climate, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditure levels, operating cash flows, or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material non-cash charges to our results of operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We are exposed to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings.

We operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment. We are involved in litigation, arbitration and other legal proceedings and subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities arising in the course of our businesses, including those contained in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years.  In addition, under the   qui tam   or  whistleblower  provisions of the federal and various state false claims acts, persons may bring lawsuits alleging that a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute or similar laws has resulted in the submission of  false  claims to federal and/or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid.  From time to time, we are also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. Substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, we could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise our expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or our cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid. The outcome of some of these legal proceedings and other contingencies could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations. Additionally, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management s attention and resources.

We could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption and/or international trade laws.

We are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the  FCPA ), U.S. export control, anti-money laundering and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also harm our reputation. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, or any other anti-bribery, anti-corruption or international trade laws, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with governmental agencies or receive export licenses. In addition, new initiatives may be proposed from time to time that impact the trading conditions in certain countries or regions, and may include retaliatory duties or trade sanctions which, if enacted, could adversely impact our trading relationships with vendors or other parties in such locations and have a material adverse effect on our operations. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign governmental agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could damage our reputation and subject us to fines or other penalties, which could materially and adversely affect our business operations, financial condition, and results of operations.

We could be subject to adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations or challenges to our tax positions.

We are a large corporation with operations in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions around the world. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the United States federal, state and local governments as well as various foreign jurisdictions. We compute our income tax provision based on enacted tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate. As the tax rates vary among jurisdictions, a change in earnings attributable to the various jurisdictions in which we operate could result in an unfavorable change in our overall tax provision. From time to time, legislative initiatives are proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition. In addition, tax laws are complex and subject to varying interpretations and any significant failure to comply with applicable tax laws and regulations in all relevant jurisdictions could give rise to substantial penalties and liabilities. Any change in enacted tax laws, rules or regulatory or judicial interpretations, any adverse outcome in connection with tax audits in any jurisdiction or any change in the pronouncements relating to accounting for income taxes could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments and results of operations.

Our insurance programs may expose us to unexpected costs.

We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance to provide for potential liability for workers  compensation; automobile and general liability; property, director and officers  liability; and employee healthcare benefits. Provisions for losses related to self-insured risks generally are based upon actuarially determined estimates. Any actuarial projection of losses is subject to a high degree of variability. Changes in legal claims, trends and interpretations, variability in inflation rates, changes in the nature and method of claims settlement, benefit level changes due to changes in applicable laws, insolvency of insurance carriers, and changes in discount rates could all materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We could be adversely impacted by changes in assumptions used in calculating pension assets and liabilities.

We operate certain defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom, which were closed to new entrants in 2010, as well as smaller plans in other jurisdictions. The valuation of the pension plan s assets and liabilities depends in part on assumptions, which are primarily based on the financial markets as well as longevity and employee retention rates. This valuation is particularly sensitive to material changes in the value of equity, bond and other investments held by the pension plans, changes in the corporate bond yields which are used in the measurement of the liabilities, changes in market expectations for long-term price inflation, and new evidence on projected longevity rates. Funding requirements and the impact on the statement of earnings relating to these pension plans are also influenced by these factors. Adverse changes in the assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities, including lower than expected pension fund investment returns and/or increased life expectancy of plan participants, or regulatory change could require us to increase the funding of its defined benefit pension plans or incur higher expenses, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial position.

Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval.

As of August 31, 2016, affiliates of Stefano Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the  SP Investors ), had sole or shared voting power, directly or indirectly, over an aggregate of approximately 13 %  of our outstanding common stock. The SP Investors have agreed to, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee for election to the Board, to vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Board s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of the Company s stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors). The SP Investors  significant interest in our common stock potentially could determine the outcome of matters submitted to a vote by our stockholders. The influence of the SP Investors could result in our taking actions that other stockholders do not support or failing to take actions that other stockholders support. As a result, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.

Shares issued to former Alliance Boots stockholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots are eligible for future sale.

We issued a total of 227.7 million shares of our common stock to former Alliance Boots shareholders in connection with our strategic combination with Alliance Boots, which was completed in December 2014. These shares generally may now be sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), subject to restrictions in the case of shares held by persons deemed to be our affiliates and to certain obligations pursuant to a shareholders agreement (as amended, the  Company Shareholders Agreement ) with certain of the SP Investors and certain affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts   Co. L.P. ( KKR , and together with certain of its affiliates, the  KKR Investors ). In February 2016, a shelf registration statement under the Securities Act registering an aggregate of 58.4 million shares of the KKR Investors and certain other stockholders became effective upon filing with the SEC. The KKR Investors sold an aggregate of 30 million of the shares registered in underwritten offerings completed in May 2016 and August 2016. Sales of the remaining shares available for future sale under this shelf registration statement may be made from time to time in the future, subject to certain obligations pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement. In addition, the Company Shareholders Agreement also contains registration rights that would obligate us, in certain instances, to file future registration statements under the Securities Act covering resales of shares issued to former Alliance Boots stockholders or to permit a  piggyback  on a future registration statement. A sale, or the perception that a sale may occur, of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.

Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also owners or directors of companies we may have dealings with.

Conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, could arise between our interests and the interests of the other entities and business activities in which our directors or officers are involved. For example, potential conflicts of interest could arise if a dispute were to arise between the Company and other parties to the Company Shareholders Agreement, including the SP Investors and the KKR Investors. Mr. Pessina, our Executive Vice Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, indirectly controls Alliance Sant  Participations S.A. ( ASP ), a privately-held company which is a party to the Company Shareholders Agreement, and he and his partner Ornella Barra, our Co-Chief Operating Officer, serve as directors of ASP. Similar potential conflicts could arise if a dispute were to arise with the KKR Investors, as Dominic Murphy is both a partner of KKR and one of our directors. Similar issues could arise in connection with other transactions in the future. While our contractual arrangements place restrictions on the parties  conduct in certain situations, and related party transactions are subject to independent review and approval in accordance with our related party transaction approval procedures and applicable law, the potential for a conflict of interest exists and such persons may have conflicts of interest, or the appearance of conflicts of interest, with respect to matters involving or affecting both companies.

Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, Delaware law and/or our agreements with certain stockholders may impede the ability of our stockholders to make changes to our Board or impede a takeover.

Certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the  DGCL ), could make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discourage, delay, or prevent a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. These provisions include the authorization of the issuance of  blank check  preferred stock that could be issued by the Board, limitations on the ability of stockholders to call special meetings, and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings. We are also subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits us, except under specified circumstances, from engaging in any mergers, significant sales of stock or assets, or business combinations with any stockholder or group of stockholders who own 15% or more of our common stock.

Under the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors are entitled to designate one nominee to the Board (currently Stefano Pessina) for so long as the SP Investors continue to meet certain beneficial ownership thresholds and subject to certain other conditions. Pursuant to the Company Shareholders Agreement, the SP Investors have agreed that, for so long as they have the right to designate a nominee to the Board, they will vote all of their shares of common stock in accordance with the Board s recommendation on matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders (including with respect to the election of directors).

While these provisions do not make us immune from takeovers or changes in the composition of the Board, and are intended to protect our stockholders from, among other things, coercive or otherwise unfair tactics, these provisions could have the effect of making it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of the Board or discouraging, delaying, or preventing a merger, consolidation, or acquisitions that stockholders may otherwise consider favorable. See also the risk factor captioned  Certain stockholders may have significant voting influence over matters requiring stockholder approval  above.

The market price of our common stock may be volatile.

The market price of shares of our common stock may be volatile. Broad general economic, political, market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of the shares, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition to the other risk factors identified in this Item 1A, factors that could cause fluctuations in the price of the shares include:  

actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and the results of competitors;

changes in financial estimates by us or by any securities analysts that might cover us;

conditions or trends in the industry, including regulatory changes or changes in the securities marketplace;

announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or divestitures;

announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us;

additions or departures of key personnel; and

issuances or sales of our common stock, including sales of shares by our directors and officers or key investors, including the SP Investors and the KKR Investors.

There are a number of additional business risks that could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results.

Many other factors could materially and adversely affect our businesses and financial results, including:

Table of Contents 

If we are unsuccessful in establishing effective advertising, marketing and promotional programs, our sales or sales margins could be negatively affected.

Our operating costs may be subject to increases outside the control of our businesses, whether due to inflation, new or increased taxes, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in market conditions or otherwise.

Our success depends on our ability to attract, engage and retain store, professional and management personnel, including in executive and other key strategic positions, and the loss of key personnel could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations, financial condition or cash flow.

Natural disasters, civil unrest, severe weather conditions, terrorist activities, global political and economic developments, war, health epidemics or pandemics or the prospect of these events can interrupt or otherwise adversely impact our operations or damage our facilities or those of our strategic partners, vendors and customers and have an adverse impact on consumer confidence levels and spending on our products and services.

If we or our affiliates were to incur significant liabilities or expense relating to the protection of the environment, related health and safety matters, environmental remediation or compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those governing exposure to, and the management and disposal of, hazardous substances, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.

The long-term effects of climate change on general economic conditions and the pharmacy industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our businesses.

If negative publicity, even if unwarranted, related to safety or quality, human and workplace rights, or other issues damage our brand image and corporate reputation, or that of our vendors or strategic allies, our businesses may suffer.

Item 1B.     Unresolved Staff Comments 

There are no unresolved written comments that were received from the SEC Staff 180 days or more before the end of our fiscal year relating to our periodic or current reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 In fiscal 2015, as a result of acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, our previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million.

(4)  
 
 In fiscal 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, the Company recorded other income (expense) of $(517) million, $779 million, $385 million and $120 million, respectively, from fair value adjustments of the AmerisourceBergen warrants and the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the warrants. Fiscal 2016 also includes income of $268 million related to the change in accounting method for our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Fiscal 2015 also includes a $94 million loss on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges. In fiscal 2014, the Company recognized a non-cash loss of $866 million related to the amendment and exercise of the Alliance Boots call option to acquire the remaining 55% share capital of Alliance Boots.

Item 7.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the description of the Company s business and reportable segments in Item 1 above. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  below and in  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. References herein to the  Company ,  we ,  us , or  our  refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to its predecessor Walgreen Co. and its subsidiaries, and in each case do not include unconsolidated partially-owned entities, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.

INTRODUCTION 

On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( Walgreens Boots Alliance ) became the successor to Walgreen Co. ( Walgreens ) pursuant to a merger to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure (the  Reorganization ), with Walgreens Boots Alliance becoming the parent holding company. Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, a Delaware corporation formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Also on December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots GmbH ( Alliance Boots ) that Walgreens did not previously own (the  Second Step Transaction ) in exchange for  3.133 billion in cash and 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The consolidated financial statements (and other data, such as prescriptions filled) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.

On October 27, 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Rite Aid Corporation ( Rite Aid ) and Victoria Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance (the  Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which we agreed, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to acquire Rite Aid, a drugstore chain in the United States with 4,550 stores in 31 states and the District of Columbia as of August 27, 2016. The Merger Agreement was approved by Rite Aid stockholders in February 2016. The transaction is expected to close  in early  calendar year  2017 , subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions . 

COMPARABILITY 

As a result of the completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, there are a number of items that affect comparability of reported results. Prior to December 31, 2014, our operations were within one reportable segment that included the results of the Retail Pharmacy USA division and corporate costs, along with the full consolidated results of Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH ( WBAD ), a global sourcing enterprise formed by Walgreens and Alliance Boots, and equity earnings from Alliance Boots. Following the completion of the Reorganization and the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, we now report results in three segments. Segmental reporting includes the allocation of synergy benefits, including WBAD s results, and the combined corporate costs for periods subsequent to December 31, 2014. We have determined that it is impracticable to allocate historical results to the current segmental presentation. Accordingly, our Retail Pharmacy USA segment results for periods prior to December 31, 2014 include all corporate costs of Walgreens, the full consolidated results of WBAD and equity income from Walgreens  pre-merger 45% interest in Alliance Boots.

The completion of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014 also means that results for the twelve month period ended August 31, 2016 include the results of Alliance Boots on a fully consolidated basis, while the twelve month period ended August 31, 2015 includes the results of Alliance Boots for eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis and as equity income from Walgreens  pre-merger 45% interest in Alliance Boots for four months (September through December 2014).

Twelve month period-over-period comparisons of results require consideration of the foregoing factors and are not directly comparable.

In addition, our sales results are affected by a number of factors, including our sales performance during holiday periods and during the cough, cold and flu season; foreign currency fluctuations; significant weather conditions; timing of our own or competitor discount programs and pricing actions; levels of reimbursement from governmental agencies and other third party payers; and general economic conditions in the markets in which we operate.

To improve comparability, certain classification changes have been made to prior period sales, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses. This change has no impact on operating income.

AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION RELATIONSHIP 

In March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen announced various agreements and arrangements, including a ten-year pharmaceutical distribution agreement between Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen pursuant to which branded and generic pharmaceutical products are sourced from AmerisourceBergen in the United States and an agreement which provides AmerisourceBergen the ability to access generics pharmaceutical products through WBAD. In May 2016, certain of these agreements were extended for three years to now expire in 2026.

In addition, in March 2013, Walgreens, Alliance Boots and AmerisourceBergen entered into agreements and arrangements pursuant to which we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time through open market purchases and pursuant to warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and gain associated representation on AmerisourceBergen s board of directors in certain circumstances. Please refer to our Form 8-K filed on March 20, 2013 for more detailed information regarding these agreements and arrangements. 

On March 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. As of August 31, 2016 we owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and had designated one member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors. As of August 31, 2016, we can acquire up to an additional 8,398,752 AmerisourceBergen shares in the open market and thereafter designate another member of AmerisourceBergen s board of directors, subject in each case to applicable legal and contractual requirements. The amount of permitted open market purchases is subject to increase or decrease in certain circumstances.

Effective March 18, 2016, we account for our investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, subject to a two-month reporting lag, with the net earnings attributable to our investment being classified within the operating income of our Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information. Due to the March 18, 2016 effective date and the two-month reporting lag, our results for the 12 month period ended August 31, 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income relating to our investment in AmerisourceBergen. Similarly, due to the timing of the transaction and the two month reporting lag, our results for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2016 will include approximately five weeks of equity income reflecting our increased ownership following the exercise on August 25, 2016 of the second tranche of warrants.

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS 

On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a new restructuring program (the  Cost Transformation Program ) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost Transformation Program implements and builds on the planned three-year, $1.0 billion cost-reduction initiative previously announced by Walgreens on August 6, 2014 and includes a number of elements designed to help achieve profitable growth through increased cost efficiencies. We have identified additional opportunities for cost savings that increase the total expected cost savings of the Cost Transformation Program by $500 million to a projected $1.5 billion by the end of fiscal 2017. Significant areas of focus include plans to close approximately 200 stores across the U.S.; reorganize divisional and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions. The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focus primarily on our Retail Pharmacy USA segment, and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017.

Table of Contents 

As of the date of this report, the Company estimates that the Cost Transformation Program  will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to our financial results in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) of between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion , which  is  $300 million  lower than the previously  estimated range of pre-tax charges at the time the Cost Transformation Program was launched), including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate payments, asset impairments and employee termination and other business transition and exit costs. As of the date of this report, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of between  $425  million and  $500  million for real estate costs, including lease obligations (net of estimated sublease income); between  $525  million and  $575  million for asset impairment charges relating primarily to asset write-offs from store closures, information technology, inventory and other non-operational real estate asset write-offs; and between  $ 350 million and  $ 425 million for employee severance and other business transition and exit costs. We estimate that approximately 60 %  of the cumulative pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures  over time , primarily related to  historical and future  lease and other real estate payments and employee separation costs. See Note 3, Restructuring, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

The amounts and timing of all estimates are subject to change until finalized. The actual amounts and timing may vary materially based on various factors. See  Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  below.

WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 

Fiscal 2016  net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance  decreased 1.1 percent to  $4.2 billion,  while diluted net earnings  per share  decreased 4.5 percent to $3.82  compared  with the prior year. The decreases reflect  fluctuations in the fair value adjustments of the company s AmerisourceBergen warrants and  the  prior year gain on the previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots, which was largely offset by the inclusion of Alliance Boots consolidated results for the entire period and  an  increase in operating income at Retail Pharmacy USA.

Other income (expense) for fiscal 2016 was an expense of $261 million as compared to income of $685 million in fiscal 2015. The change in fair value of our AmerisourceBergen warrants resulted in a loss of $546 million for fiscal 2016, as compared to income of $759 million for fiscal 2015. Additionally, we recognized income of $268 million for fiscal year ended 2016 related to the change in accounting method for our investment in AmerisourceBergen. 

Interest was a net expense of $596 million and $605 million in fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fiscal 2016 included interest expense on notes issued during June 2016. Fiscal 2015 included interest expense of $99 million related to the repayment of a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 and 2015 was 19.4% and 19.9%, respectively. The net decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to several factors.  First, our 2016 effective tax rate benefited from having a full-year of foreign sourced pre-tax earnings taxed at lower rates as compared to 2015, when the Company had only eight months of those earnings after the Second Step Transaction.  Further, in 2016 our domestic pre-tax earnings were reduced as a result of the AmerisourceBergen warrants then held by the Company.  In addition, during 2016 the Company benefitted from enacted tax law changes (tax rate reductions) in multiple foreign tax jurisdictions, most notably the United Kingdom, which generated a $178 million tax benefit.  The Company also had fewer non-deductible expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015.  These items were partly offset by the facts that in 2015 the Company had a non-taxable gain on its previously held equity investment in Alliance Boots and recognized the benefit of a capital loss deferred tax asset, neither of which recurred in 2016.

Walgreens Boots Alliance Adjusted Diluted Net Earnings Per Share (Non-GAAP measure) 

Adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance  in fiscal 2016 increased 22.6 percent to $5.0 billion compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted net earnings per share in the fiscal year increased 18.3 percent to $4.59 compared with the prior year.  The increase in adjusted net earnings and adjusted diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to inclusion of Alliance Boots consolidated results for the entire period and  an increase in operating income  at Retail Pharmacy USA. See  --Non-GAAP Measures  below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

Our results for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 were primarily impacted by the Second Step Transaction which resulted in the full consolidation of Alliance Boots results of operations beginning December 31, 2014. For fiscal 2015, the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations increased our sales by 29.4%, gross profit by 22.9%, selling general and administrative expenses by 23.1% and operating income by 18.5%, each as compared to fiscal 2014. See   -- Comparability  above.

Table of Contents 

Net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. for fiscal 2015 were $4.2 billion, or $4.00 per share on a diluted basis as compared to $1.9 billion, or $2.00 per share on a diluted basis in fiscal 2014. The increase in diluted net earnings per share for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, was primarily attributable to the full consolidation of Alliance Boots operations from January through August 2015, a gain on our 45% previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots, increased sales in our Retail Pharmacy USA division, increased income from our warrants to acquire AmerisourceBergen common stock and a lower effective income tax rate. These increases were partially offset by lower Retail Pharmacy USA gross margins and a higher interest expense.

As a result of acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots on December 31, 2014, our previously held 45% interest was remeasured to fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million in fiscal 2015. The fair value of the previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots was determined using the income approach methodology. The fair value measurement of the previously held equity interest is based on significant inputs not observable in the market. The fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest are based on (a) projected discounted cash flows, (b) historical and projected financial information, and (c) synergies including cost savings, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating the fair value of the previously held equity interest in Alliance Boots. See Note 7. Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Other income (expense) for fiscal 2015 was income of $685 million as compared to expense of $481 million in fiscal 2014. The change in fair value of our AmerisourceBergen warrants resulted in recording income of $759 million and $366 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in fair value was primarily attributed to the change in the price of AmerisourceBergen s common stock. In addition, we recorded $20 million and $19 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, of other income relating to the amortization of the deferred credit associated with the initial value of the Walgreens warrants. We have also recorded a loss of $94 million in fiscal 2015 on derivative contracts that were not designated as accounting hedges. The losses primarily relate to foreign currency forward contracts entered into in consideration of the delivery of foreign cash consideration related to the Second Step Transaction. Fiscal 2014 results also included a loss of $866 million related to the Alliance Boots call option.  Upon the amendment and immediate exercise of the call option to acquire the remaining 55% ownership of Alliance Boots, we were required to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option. The fair value of the amended option was estimated to be zero based on its valuation as a financial instrument without regard for its strategic value. The reduction in value was primarily due to the shorter duration of the amended option and the appreciation since the original valuation in the price of Walgreens stock used as partial consideration for the purchase of the remaining 55% ownership interest in Alliance Boots. 

Interest was a net expense of $605 million and $156 million in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in fiscal 2015 interest expense is primarily due to the notes we issued to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the Second Step Transaction and to subsequently refinance substantially all of Alliance Boots  outstanding borrowings following completion of the Second Step Transaction. Additionally, in fiscal 2015 we repaid a portion of our long-term debt in advance of its maturity resulting in additional net interest expense of $99 million.

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 and 2014 was 19.9% and 42.9%, respectively. The decrease in the fiscal 2015 effective tax rate as compared to fiscal 2014 is primarily attributable to recording discrete tax benefits related to previously unrecognized capital loss deferred tax assets as a result of recognizing capital gain income from fiscal 2015 and anticipated future period sale-leaseback transactions. In addition, as a result of our acquisition of the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots that we did not previously own, our annual effective tax rate decreased due to incremental foreign source income taxed at lower rates and additional favorable permanent book-tax differences. Also as a result of the acquisition, we recognized a non-recurring tax benefit that also lowered our annual effective tax rate. In addition, we recognized other, net discrete tax benefits in the current fiscal year.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS BY SEGMENT 

Retail Pharmacy USA

As a result of the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company ceased recording equity earnings in Alliance Boots as of December 31, 2014. As such, the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 includes equity income from Walgreens  pre-merger 45% interest in Alliance Boots for four months (September through December 2014).

(1)  
 
 See  --Non-GAAP Measures  below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure and related disclosures.

(2)  
 
 Includes immunizations.

(3)  
 
 Includes the adjustment to convert prescriptions greater than 84 days to the equivalent of three 30-day prescriptions. This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.

(5)  
 
 Comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or subject to a natural disaster in the past twelve months. Relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other  retailers   methods.

Sales fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 

The Retail Pharmacy USA division s sales for fiscal 2016 increased by 3.5% to $83.8 billion. Sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 3.8% in fiscal 2016 driven by growth in Medicare Part D prescriptions, partially offset by the impact from the sale of a majority interest in our infusion business in fiscal 2015. We operated 8,184 locations (8,175 drugstores) as of August 31, 2016, compared to 8,182 locations (8,173 drugstores) a year earlier.

Table of Contents 

Pharmacy sales increased by 5.5% in fiscal 2016 and represented 67.4% of the division s sales. In fiscal 2015, pharmacy sales were up 8.2% and represented 66.1% of the division s sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 6.0% in fiscal 2016 compared to an increase of 9.3% in fiscal 2015. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.9% in fiscal 2016 versus a reduction of 1.8% in fiscal 2015. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.1% in fiscal 2016 compared to a reduction of 1.0% for fiscal 2015. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 97.4% of prescription sales for fiscal 2016 compared to 96.8% for fiscal 2015. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2016 was 740.1 million compared to 723.2 million in fiscal 2015. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 928.5 million in fiscal 2016 versus 893.8 million in fiscal 2015.

Retail sales decreased 0.3% in fiscal 2016 and were 32.6% of the division s sales. In comparison, fiscal 2015 retail sales increased 1.9% and comprised 33.9% of the division s sales. Comparable retail sales decreased 0.3% in fiscal 2016 compared to an increase of 1.5% in fiscal 2015. The decrease in comparable retail sales growth in the current fiscal year was primarily due to weakness in consumables and general merchandise, which was partially offset by increased sales in health and wellness,  and  photo categories.

Operating Income fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 

Retail Pharmacy USA division s operating income for fiscal 2016 increased 13.2% to $4.4 billion. The increase is primarily due to higher  pharmacy volume  and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales.

Gross margin as a percent of sales was 26.6% in fiscal 2016 compared to 26.9% in fiscal 2015. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements .  The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by the favorable impact of procurement efficiencies. Retail margins were  negatively  impacted in the current period primarily from  performance in seasonal, consumables and general merchandise  categories ,  partially offset by performance in  health  and  wellness, beauty and photo  categories.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 21.4% in fiscal 2016 compared to 22.5% in fiscal 2015. As a percentage of sales, expenses in the current period were lower primarily due to increased efficiencies and cost controls associated with the Cost Transformation Program.

Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 

Retail Pharmacy USA division s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2016 increased 5.1% to $5.4 billion. The increase is primarily due to higher  pharmacy volume  and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. See  --Non-GAAP Measures  below for a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Sales fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

The Retail Pharmacy USA division s sales for fiscal 2015 increased by 6.0% to $81.0 billion. Sales increased primarily due to higher comparable store sales, which were up 6.4% in fiscal 2015. We operated 8,182 locations (8,173 drugstores) as of August 31, 2015, compared to 8,309 locations (8,207 drugstores) a year earlier. Prior year s locations included 91 infusion and respiratory services facilities in which we sold a majority interest in fiscal 2015.

Pharmacy sales increased by 8.2% in fiscal 2015 and represented 66.1% of the division s sales. In fiscal 2014, pharmacy sales were up 7.9% and represented 64.2% of the division s sales. Comparable pharmacy sales increased 9.3% in fiscal 2015 compared to an increase of 6.8% in fiscal 2014. The effect of generic drugs, which have a lower retail price, replacing brand name drugs reduced prescription sales by 1.8% in fiscal 2015 versus a reduction of 1.3% in fiscal 2014. The effect of generics on division sales was a reduction of 1.0% in fiscal 2015 compared to a reduction of 0.7% for fiscal 2014. Third party sales, where reimbursement is received from managed care organizations, governmental agencies, employers or private insurers, were 96.8% of prescription sales for fiscal 2015 compared to 96.5% for fiscal 2014. The total number of prescriptions (including immunizations) filled in fiscal 2015 was 723.2 million compared to 698.9 million in fiscal 2014. Prescriptions (including immunizations) adjusted to 30-day equivalents were 893.8 million in fiscal 2015 versus 856.4 million in fiscal 2014.

Retail sales increased 1.9% in fiscal 2015 and were 33.9% of the division s sales. In comparison, fiscal 2014 retail sales increased 2.1% and comprised 35.8% of the division s sales. Comparable retail sales increased 1.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to an increase of 2.0% in fiscal 2014. The increase in comparable retail sales in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 was primarily attributed to an increase in basket size partially offset by lower customer traffic.

Operating Income fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

Retail Pharmacy USA division s operating income for fiscal 2015 decreased 7.2% to $3.9 billion. The decrease is primarily due to having equity earnings in Alliance Boots for four months in the current year versus twelve months in the comparable period and current year costs related to the Cost Transformation Program.

Gross margin as a percent of sales was 26.9% in fiscal 2015 compared to 28.2% in fiscal 2014. Pharmacy margins were negatively impacted in the current fiscal year by lower third-party reimbursements; an increase in Medicare Part D mix; the strategy to continue driving 90-day prescriptions at retail; and the mix of specialty drugs, which carry a lower margin percentage. The decrease in pharmacy margins was partially offset by additional brand-to-generic drug conversions compared with the prior fiscal year. Retail margins were positively impacted in fiscal 2015 primarily from the non-prescription drug, beauty and beverage and snack categories partially offset by the electronics category.

Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were 22.5% in fiscal 2015 compared to 23.6% in fiscal 2014. As a percentage of sales, expenses in fiscal 2015 were lower primarily due to store labor efficiencies partially offset by higher costs related to the Cost Transformation Program.

Adjusted Operating Income (Non-GAAP measure) fiscal 2015 compared to fiscal 2014 

Retail Pharmacy USA division s adjusted operating income for fiscal 2015 increased 4.8% to $5.1 billion. The increase is primarily due to higher sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by having four months of equity earnings in Alliance Boots in fiscal 2015 versus twelve months in fiscal 2014 and lower gross margins. See  --Non-GAAP Measures  below for reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure.

Retail Pharmacy International

The businesses included in our Retail Pharmacy International division were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction. The Retail Pharmacy International division s results, including the increases in sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and operating income for fiscal 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year was primarily impacted by the Second Step Transaction, which resulted in the full consolidation of Alliance Boots results of operations beginning December 31, 2014. Accordingly, the results for this segment for fiscal 2016 include the results of Alliance Boots on a fully consolidated basis, while fiscal 2015 results include only eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis, and such results are not directly comparable. Results include the effects of foreign currency exchange rates, including the British Pound, Euro, Chilean Peso and Mexican Peso. To improve comparability, certain classification changes have been made to prior period results. This change has no impact on operating income. See Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk, Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk for further information on currency risk.

 Comparable stores are defined as those that have been open for at least twelve consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days and without a major remodel or a natural disaster in the past twelve months. Relocated and acquired stores are not included as comparable stores for the first twelve months after the relocation or acquisition. The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our method of calculating comparable sales may not be the same as other retailers  methods.

 Operating results reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We use the term  constant currency  to represent results that have been adjusted to exclude foreign currency impact. Foreign currency impact represents the difference in results that are attributable to fluctuations in the currency exchange rates used to convert the results for businesses where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. This impact is calculated by translating current period results at the currency exchange rates used in the comparable period in the prior year, rather than the exchange rates in effect during the current period. See  --Non-GAAP Measures  below.

Pharmaceutical Wholesale

The businesses included in our Pharmaceutical Wholesale division were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction. The Pharmaceutical Wholesale division s results, including the increases in sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and operating income, for fiscal 2016 as compared to the comparable prior year was primarily impacted by the Second Step Transaction, which resulted in the full consolidation of Alliance Boots results of operations beginning December 31, 2014. Accordingly, the results for this segment for fiscal 2016 include the results of Alliance Boots on a fully consolidated basis, while fiscal 2015 results include only eight months (January through August 2015) on a fully consolidated basis, and such results are not directly comparable.

NON-GAAP MEASURES 

The following information provides reconciliations of the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures, as defined under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, presented herein to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. As a global company, our operating results reported in U.S. dollars are affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations because the underlying foreign currencies in which we transact change in value over time compared to the U.S. dollar; accordingly, we present certain constant currency financial information to provide a framework to assess how our businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We provide non-GAAP financial measures, which are not calculated or presented in accordance with GAAP, as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures are presented because our management has evaluated our financial results both including and excluding the adjusted items or the effects of foreign currency translation, as applicable, and believe that the supplemental non-GAAP financial measures presented provide additional perspective and insights when analyzing the core operating performance of our business from period to period and trends in our historical operating results. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered superior to, as a substitute for or as an alternative to, and should be considered in conjunction with, the GAAP financial measures presented.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 

Cash and cash equivalents were $9.8 billion (including $1.6 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) as of August 31, 2016, compared to $3.0 billion (including $1.7 billion in non-U.S. jurisdictions) at August 31, 2015. Short-term investment objectives are primarily to minimize risk and maintain liquidity. To attain these objectives, investment limits are placed on the amount, type and issuer of securities. Investments are principally in U.S. Treasury money market funds and AAA-rated money market funds.

Our long-term capital policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, reinvest in our core strategies, invest in strategic opportunities that reinforce our core strategies and meet return requirements, and return surplus cash flow to stockholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the long term.  

Cash provided by operations and the issuance of debt are the principal sources of funds for expansion, investments, acquisitions, remodeling programs, dividends to stockholders and stock repurchases. Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.8 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $5.7 billion in fiscal 2015 and $3.9 billion in fiscal 2014.

Net cash used for investing activities was $3.5 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2015 and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2014. The exercise of the AmerisourceBergen warrants used $2.4 billion of cash in the current year. The Alliance Boots acquisition used $4.5 billion of cash in the comparable prior year period. Other business acquisitions in fiscal 2016 were $126 million compared to $371 million in the comparable prior year period. Business acquisitions in the current period include the acquisition of an international beauty brand and prescription files. Other business acquisitions in the prior year period were primarily the purchase of prescription files.

Additions to property, plant and equipment in fiscal 2016 were $1.3 billion compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015 and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2014. Capital expenditures by reporting segment were as follows: 

(1)  
 
 Our Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction in which we acquired the 55% of Alliance Boots that we did not already own on December 31, 2014. As a result of the timing of the acquisition, only eight months of capital expenditures (January through August 2015) have been reported for these divisions in fiscal 2015.

Our Retail Pharmacy USA segment opened, relocated or acquired 107 locations in fiscal 2016 compared to 133 locations in fiscal 2015 and 268 locations in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2014 acquisitions included Kerr Drug, which contributed 76 drugstore locations as well as a specialty pharmacy and a distribution center. Significant Retail Pharmacy International capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in our stores and information technology projects. Pharmaceutical Wholesale capital expenditures primarily relate to investments in warehouses and operations and information technology projects.

Additionally, investing activities for fiscal 2016 included proceeds related to sale leaseback transactions of $60 million, compared to  $867  million in the comparable prior year period, and the sale of a pharmaceutical wholesale operation for $43 million compared to the $814 million sale of Walgreen Infusion Services in the comparable prior year period.

Net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 was $2.6 billion compared to net cash used for financing activities of $915 million in fiscal 2015 and $1.6 billion in fiscal 2014.   In fiscal 2016, we received proceeds from public offerings of $6.0 billion of U.S. dollar denominated debt (described below). In fiscal 2015, we received proceeds from public offerings of $8.0 billion of U.S. dollar denominated debt, approximately $2.0 billion of Euro and Pound Sterling denominated debt and borrowed approximately $2.2 billion on a Pound Sterling denominated term loan which was used to refinance substantially all of Alliance Boots outstanding borrowings following the completion of the Second Step Transaction and pay related fees and expenses.  We repurchased shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans totaling $1.0 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $500 million in fiscal 2015 and $705 million in fiscal 2014. Proceeds related to employee stock plans were $235 million in fiscal 2016 compared to $503 million in fiscal 2015 and $612 million in fiscal 2014. Cash dividends paid were $1.6 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. We currently intend to continue to maintain a long-term dividend payout ratio target of approximately 30 to 35 percent of adjusted net earnings attributable to Walgreens Boots Alliance.

In August 2014, the Walgreens Board of Directors authorized the 2014 stock repurchase program (the  2014 stock repurchase program ), which  authorized  the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Walgreens  (or, after the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance s) common stock prior to the program s expiration on August 31, 2016. We purchased 1.3 million shares under the 2014 stock repurchase program in fiscal 2016 at a total cost of $110 million, compared to 8.2 million shares purchased in fiscal 2015 at a total cost of $726 million. We determine the timing and amount of repurchases based on our assessment of various factors, including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity and the economic environment. As the consideration payable to Rite Aid stockholders will be paid in cash, we suspended activity under the 2014 stock repurchase program (other than share repurchases to offset dilution from our equity incentive plans   see Part II, Item 2 below) following our entry into the Merger Agreement. We have repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable us to repurchase shares at times when we otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.

The Company periodically borrows under its commercial paper program and may borrow under it in future periods. There were no commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of August 31, 2016 or 2015. The Company had weighted average daily short-term borrowings of $14 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.66% in fiscal 2016. We had weighted average daily short-term borrowings of $82 million of commercial paper outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.52% in fiscal 2015.

On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a term loan credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the  Term Loan Agreement ), which provided Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens with the ability to borrow up to  1.45 billion on an unsecured basis. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the reserve adjusted LIBOR plus an applicable margin based on our credit ratings. As of August 31, 2016, we have borrowed  1.45 billion ($1.9 billion at the August 31, 2016 spot rate of $1.31 to  1) under the Term Loan Agreement.  As of August 31, 2015, we had borrowed  1.45 billion ($2.2 billion at the August 31, 2015 spot rate of $1.54 to  1) under the Term Loan Agreement. 

On November 10, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a five-year unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit agreement with the lenders party thereto (the  Revolving Credit Agreement ), which has available credit of $3.0 billion, of which $500 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at our option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted LIBOR, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on our credit ratings. As of August 31, 2016, there were no borrowings or letters of credit issued pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement.

Total upfront fees related to the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement were $14 million. We pay a facility fee to the financing banks to keep these lines of credit active.

Walgreens guaranteed the punctual payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance under the Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement until August 10, 2015, when such guarantees were unconditionally released and discharged (as described below).

On November 18, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued several series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes totaling $8.0 billion, with maturities ranging from 2016 to 2044. All such notes have fixed interest rates, with the exception of the $750 million notes due 2016, which were repaid in full in May 2016 and which had a floating rate based on the three month LIBOR plus a fixed spread of 45 basis points.

On November 20, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance issued series of unsecured, unsubordinated notes that included total Pound Sterling denominated debt of  700 million ($1.1 billion based on the November 20, 2014 exchange rate) with maturities due 2020 and 2025 and Euro denominated debt of  750 million ($940 million based on the November 20, 2014 exchange rate) due 2026. All notes issued on November 20, 2014 have fixed interest rates. The notes issued on November 18, 2014 and November 20, 2014 are collectively referred to as the  2014 WBA notes . The 2014 WBA notes were, upon initial issuance, fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis by Walgreens.

On December 19, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walgreens entered into a Revolving Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto (as amended, the  364-Day Credit Agreement ). The 364-Day Credit Agreement was a $750 million, 364-day unsecured, multicurrency revolving facility. On July 9, 2015, the 364-Day Credit Agreement was amended to remove Walgreens as a borrower thereunder, eliminate Walgreens  guarantee  of all obligations of Walgreens Boots Alliance thereunder  and make certain conforming changes to effectuate those modifications, including modifications and deletions of certain definitions and cross-references. On December 17, 2015, the Company terminated the 364-Day Credit Agreement. The 364-Day Credit Agreement remained undrawn as of the date of termination and would have matured on December 30, 2015.

The 364-Day Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Agreement and Revolving Credit Agreement described above each contain or contained (as applicable) a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60 to 1.00, as well as other customary restrictive covenants. As of August 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all such applicable covenants.

On July 9, 2015, pursuant to an indenture, dated as of July 17, 2008, between Walgreens and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, notices of redemption were given to (i) holders of 1.800% unsecured notes due 2017 (the  2017 Notes ) and (ii) holders of 5.25% unsecured notes due 2019 (the  2019 Notes ), in each case issued by Walgreens under the indenture. As a result, on August 10, 2015 (the  redemption date ), the 2017 Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.0 billion were redeemed in full and $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes were redeemed. The partial redemption of the 2019 Notes resulted in $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 Notes remaining outstanding. The redemption price with respect to the 2017 Notes was equal to 101.677% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date. The redemption price with respect to the 2019 Notes was equal to 111.734% of the aggregate principal amount of such notes to be redeemed, plus accrued interest thereon to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On August 10, 2015, upon the completion of  the redemptions described above,  the Walgreens guarantees of the 2014 WBA notes and the   Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement   were unconditionally released and discharged in accordance with their terms. 

Pending Rite Aid Transaction.   The cash consideration payable to Rite Aid stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement described under  Introduction  above is expected to be financed with a combination of cash on hand and debt financing. In connection with the Merger Agreement, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a bridge facility commitment letter (as amended and restated, the  Commitment Letter ) with UBS Securities LLC and UBS AG, Stamford Branch for a $12.8 billion senior unsecured bridge facility. 

On December 18, 2015, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto (as amended, the  Bridge Credit Agreement ) and a Term Loan Credit Agreement with the lenders party thereto (as amended, the  2015 Term Loan Credit Agreement  and, together with the Bridge Credit Agreement, the  2015 Credit Agreements ). The Commitment Letter and the commitments contemplated thereby terminated upon Walgreens Boots Alliance entering into the 2015 Credit Agreements.

The Bridge Credit Agreement is a 364-day unsecured bridge term loan facility and had initial aggregate commitments of $7.8 billion, which may be increased by Walgreens Boots Alliance prior to the funding of the loans thereunder by up to $2.0 billion in certain circumstances. As a result of the issuance of the notes and receipt of proceeds therefrom on June 1, 2016 and the entry into the term loan credit agreement on August 30, 2016, in each case, as described below, Walgreens Boots Alliance reduced its commitment under the Bridge Credit Agreement by approximately $6.0 billion and $1 billion, respectively, to approximately $0.8 billion. Walgreens Boots Alliance can extend up to $3.0 billion of the loans under the Bridge Credit Agreement for an additional 90-day period if desired. As of August 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement. The 2015 Term Loan Credit Agreement is a $5.0 billion unsecured term loan facility comprising two tranches with maturities three and five years following the funding date, or, if earlier, three and five years after October 27, 2016. The obligations of the lenders party to each of the Bridge Credit Agreement and the 2015 Term Loan Credit Agreement become effective upon the date of closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As of August 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under the 2015 Term Loan Credit Agreement.

Walgreens Boots Alliance will be the borrower under each of the 2015 Credit Agreements. The ability of Walgreens Boots Alliance to request the making of loans under each of the 2015 Credit Agreements is subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of certain conditions set forth therein and will terminate upon the occurrence of certain events set forth therein. Borrowings under each of the 2015 Credit Agreements will bear interest at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to, at Walgreens Boots Alliance s option, the alternate base rate or the reserve adjusted Eurocurrency rate, in each case, plus an applicable margin calculated based on Walgreens Boots Alliance s credit ratings. Upfront fees paid to date in connection with the 2015 Credit Agreements totaled $30 million. In addition, Walgreens Boots Alliance will also pay to the lenders under each of the 2015 Credit Agreements certain customary fees, including a ticking fee based on the aggregate outstanding commitments of the lenders under the applicable 2015 Credit Agreement starting at 90 days after signing.

On June 1, 2016,  Walgreens Boots Alliance issued in an underwritten public offering  $1.2 billion of 1.750% notes due 2018 (the  2018 notes ), $1.5 billion of 2.600% notes due 2021 (the  2021 notes ), $0.8 billion  of 3.100% notes due 2023 (the  2023 notes ), $1.9 billion of 3.450% notes due 2026 (the  2026 notes ) and $0.6 billion of 4.650% notes due 2046 (the  2046 notes ). These notes are subject to redemption in certain circumstances. Walgreens Boots Alliance intends to use the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to fund a portion of the cash consideration payable in connection with the merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement, to retire a portion of Rite Aid s existing debt and to pay related fees and expenses. Any remaining net proceeds from the sale of the notes may also be used for general corporate purposes. In the event that such merger is not consummated on or prior to June 1, 2017 (the first anniversary of the issuance date of the notes) or if the Merger Agreement is terminated at any time on or prior to June 1, 2017, then Walgreens Boots Alliance will be required to redeem in full the 2018 notes, the 2021 notes and the 2023 notes (but not the 2026 notes or 2046 notes, which will remain outstanding in accordance with their respective terms) on the date described in the applicable note at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. In addition, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, if the Merger Agreement is terminated by us or Rite Aid (i) due to the entry of a final order enjoining or prohibiting the merger by any antitrust authority, or (ii) following January 27, 2017 because required antitrust approvals have not been obtained or an antitrust authority has issued an injunction or order preventing the merger, we could be required to pay Rite Aid a termination fee of up to $650 million in certain circumstances.

On August 30, 2016, Walgreens Boots Alliance entered into a $1.0 billion senior unsecured term loan facility with the lender party thereto (the  2016 Term Loan Credit Agreement ) comprising two tranches with maturities on March 30, 2017 and one year after the funding date, respectively. The obligations of the lender under the 2016 Term Loan Credit Agreement become effective upon the date of closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. As of August 31, 2016, there were no borrowings under the 2016 Term Loan Credit Agreement.

Each of the Company s 2015 Credit Agreements and the 2016 Term Loan Credit Agreement contain a covenant to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization not to exceed 0.60:1.00, as well as other customary restrictive covenants, such restrictive covenants shall not be in effect until the funding of the loans under the applicable credit agreement.

In assessing our credit strength, each rating agency consider various factors including our business model, capital structure, financial policies and financial performance. There can be no assurance that any particular rating will be assigned or maintained. Our credit ratings impact our borrowing costs, access to capital markets and operating lease costs. The rating agency ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our debt securities or commercial paper. Each rating may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.

Pursuant to our arrangements with AmerisourceBergen, we have the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a minority equity position in AmerisourceBergen over time as described under  --AmerisourceBergen Corporation Relationship  above. As of August 31, 2016,  the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock. This includes  a total of approximately 11.5 million  shares of  AmerisourceBergen  that we purchased  in the open market. Share purchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions or pursuant to instruments and plans complying with Rule 10b5-1. Our ability to invest in equity in AmerisourceBergen above certain thresholds is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals.

On March 18, 2016, we exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, we exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. The transactions were funded using existing cash on hand. See Note 5, Equity Method Investments,  to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein  for further information.

We believe that cash flow from operations, availability under our existing credit facilities and arrangements, current cash and investment balances and our ability to obtain other financing, if necessary, will provide adequate cash funds for our foreseeable working capital needs, capital expenditures at existing facilities, dividend payments and debt service obligations for at least the next 12 months. Our cash requirements are subject to change as business conditions warrant and opportunities arise. The timing and size of any new business ventures or acquisitions that we may complete may also impact our cash requirements.

See Item 7A (Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk) below for a discussion of certain financing and market risks.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 

The information set forth in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

The consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and include amounts based on management s prudent judgments and estimates. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Management believes that any reasonable deviation from those judgments and estimates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. To the extent that the estimates used differ from actual results, however, adjustments to the statement of earnings and corresponding balance sheet accounts would be necessary. These adjustments would be made in future periods. Some of the more significant estimates include business combinations, goodwill and  indefinite-lived  intangible asset impairment, vendor allowances, liability for closed locations, cost of sales and inventory, equity method investments, pension and postretirement benefits and income taxes. We use the following methods to determine our estimates:

Business Combinations      We account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires that once control is obtained, all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, be recorded at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when market value is not readily available.

For intangible assets, we generally use the income approach to determine fair value. The income approach requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: discount rates, terminal growth rates,  royalty rates,  forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The discount rates applied to the projections reflect the risk factors associated with those projections.

- 48 - 

Table of Contents 

Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on the determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired.

Judgment is also required in determining the intangible asset s useful life.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment    Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of our impairment analysis for each reporting unit, we determine fair value for each reporting unit. This determination includes estimating the fair value using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping.

The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and liabilities within those reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to: the selection of appropriate peer group companies, control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete, discount rates, terminal growth rates, forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures. The allocation requires analysis to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including purchased prescription files, customer relationships, pharmacy licenses and trade names. Although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, or both.

We also compared the sum of the estimated fair values of the reporting units to the Company s fair value as implied by the market value of the Company s equity and debt securities. This comparison indicated that, in total, our assumptions and estimates were reasonable. However, future declines in the overall market value of the Company s equity and debt securities may indicate that the fair value of one or more reporting units has declined below its carrying value.

Our reporting units  fair values exceeded their carrying amounts ranging from approximately  17 % to more than  116 %. See Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset to its carrying value. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss is recognized and the asset is written down to its estimated fair value.

Our indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value is estimated using the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method of the income approach. These estimates can be affected by a number of factors including, but not limited to, general economic conditions, availability of market information as well as our profitability.

Vendor allowances     Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors  products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Those allowances received for promoting vendors  products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs.  

Liability for closed locations     The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date  .

Table of Contents 

Cost of sales and inventory      Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs, certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Cost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts.  Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market determined by the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method for the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and on a first-in first-out ( FIFO ) basis for inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments except for retail inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International segment, which is valued using the retail method. 

Equity method investments      We use the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. Our proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as our ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material purchase and sale transactions.

Pension and postretirement benefits    We have various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of our foreign employees. We also have postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans varies depending on participants  status, date of hire and or length of service. Our pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by our actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term rate of return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. In determining our long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, we consider both the historical performance of the investment portfolio as well as the long-term market return expectations based on the investment mix of the portfolio. A change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on our projected benefit obligation and pension expense. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would result in a decline of $440 million to our pension benefit obligation. A 25 basis point decrease on the expected return on plan assets assumption would increase our pension expense by $24 million.

Our policy is to fund our pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations. Our postretirement healthcare plans are not funded.

Income taxes    We are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with our various tax filing positions, we record a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to our liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which we determine the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available. Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued penalties and interest, is primarily included in other long-term liabilities and current income taxes on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and in income tax provision in our Consolidated St atements  of Earnings.

In determining our provision for income taxes, we use income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and enacted statutory income tax rates. The provision for income taxes rate also reflects our assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits in addition to any foreign-based income deemed to be taxable in the United States. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk  

Interest Rate Risk

We are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to existing debt issuances. Primary exposures include LIBOR and commercial paper rates. From time to time, we use interest rate derivative contracts including interest rate caps, interest rate swaps and forward-starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes on existing debt and future debt issuances respectively, to reduce the volatility of our financing costs and, based on current and projected market conditions, achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating-rate debt. Generally under these swaps, we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed-rate and floating-rate interest amounts based on an agreed upon notional principal amount.

Information regarding our transactions are set forth in Note 10, Financial Instruments to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These financial instruments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. On August 31, 2016, we had approximately $1.9 billion in long-term debt obligations that had floating interest rates. A one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on the various debt instruments we hold would increase or decrease the annual interest expense we recognize and the cash we pay for interest expense by approximately $19 million. The amounts exclude the impact of any associated derivative contracts.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily with respect to the British Pound Sterling and    Euro,   and certain other foreign currencies, including the  Mexican Peso, Chilean Peso, Norwegian Krone and Turkish Lira  which may affect our net investment in foreign subsid iaries and may cause fluctuations in cash flows related to foreign denominated transactions. We are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the U.S. dollar. We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on non-functional currency cash flows of certain entities denominated in foreign currencies. These transactions are almost exclusively less than 12 months in maturity. In addition, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated in hedging relationships to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany financing transactions ) . As circumstances warrant, we also use basis swaps     as hedging instruments to hedge portions of our net investments in foreign operations. The foreign currency derivative instruments are sensitive to changes in exchange rates. A 1% increase or decrease in exchange rates would increase or decrease our pre-tax income by approximately $3 million due to changes in the value of foreign currency derivative instruments. Excluded from the computation were anticipated transactions, foreign currency trade payables and receivables, and net investments in foreign subsidiaries, which the abovementioned instruments are intended to partially hedge. 

Equity Price  Risk 

Changes in AmerisourceBergen common stock price may have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity investment in AmerisourceBergen described in Note 5, Equity Method Investments to our Consolidated Financial Statements. See  -- AmerisourceBergen Corporation Relationship  above.

WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. Organization 

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ( Walgreens Boots Alliance ) and its subsidiaries are a global pharmacy-led health and wellbeing enterprise. Its operations are conducted through three reportable segments (Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale). See Note 18, Segment Reporting for further information.

On December 31, 2014, Walgreens Boots Alliance became the successor of Walgreen Co. ( Walgreens ) pursuant to a merger designed to effect a reorganization of Walgreens into a holding company structure (the  Reorganization ). Pursuant to the Reorganization, Walgreens became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walgreens Boots Alliance, a Delaware corporation formed for the purposes of the Reorganization, and each issued and outstanding share of Walgreens common stock converted on a one-to-one basis into Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. References to the  Company  refer to Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014 and, prior to that time, to the predecessor registrant Walgreens and its subsidiaries, except as otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires.

On December 31, 2014, following the completion of the Reorganization, Walgreens Boots Alliance completed the acquisition of the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots GmbH ( Alliance Boots ) that Walgreens did not previously own (the  Second Step Transaction ) in exchange for  3.133 billion in cash and approximately 144.3 million shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance common stock. Alliance Boots became a consolidated subsidiary and ceased being accounted for under the equity method immediately upon completion of the Second Step Transaction. For financial reporting and accounting purposes, Walgreens Boots Alliance was the acquirer of Alliance Boots. The consolidated financial statements (and other data) reflect the results of operations and financial position of Walgreens and its subsidiaries for periods prior to December 31, 2014 and of Walgreens Boots Alliance and its subsidiaries for periods from and after the effective time of the Reorganization on December 31, 2014.

2.  Summary of Major Accounting Policies 

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries in which the Company holds a controlling interest. Investments in less than majority-owned companies in which the Company does not have a controlling interest, but does have significant influence, are accounted for as equity method investments. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated.   The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. The Company bases its estimates on the information available at the time, its experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Adjustments may be made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ.

Because of the acquisition of Alliance Boots, influence of certain holidays, seasonality, foreign currency rates, changes in vendor, payer and customer relationships and terms and other factors on the Company s operations, net earnings for any period may not be comparable to the same period in previous years. In addition, the positive impact on gross profit margins and gross profit dollars typically has been significant in the first several months after a generic version of a drug is first allowed to compete with the branded version, which is generally referred to as a  generic conversion . In any given year, the number of major brand name drugs that undergo a conversion from branded to generic status can increase or decrease, which can have a significant impact on the Company s Retail Pharmacy USA segment s sales, gross profit margins and gross profit dollars.

To improve comparability, certain classification changes have been made to prior  periods to conform to current year classifications. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Credit and debit card receivables from banks, which generally settle within two to seven business days, of $114 million and $165 million were included in cash and cash equivalents at August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Restricted Cash

The Company is required to maintain cash deposits with certain banks which consist of deposits restricted under contractual agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations. As of August 31, 2016 and 2015, the amount of such restricted cash was $185 million, and $184 million respectively  and is reported in Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets .

Table of Contents 

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable balances primarily include amounts due from third party providers (e.g., pharmacy benefit managers, insurance companies and governmental agencies), clients and members, as well as vendors and manufacturers. Charges to bad debt are based on estimates of recoverability using both historical write-offs and specifically identified receivables.  The allowance for doubtful accounts for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $166 million, $172 million and $173 million, respectively. 

Inventory

The Company values inventories on a lower of cost or market basis. Inventory includes product costs, inbound freight, direct labor, warehousing costs, overhead costs relating to the manufacture and distribution of products and vendor allowances not classified as a reduction of advertising expense.

The Company s Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventory is accounted for using the last-in-first-out ( LIFO ) method. At August 31, 2016 and 2015, Retail Pharmacy USA segment inventories would have been greater by $2.8 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, if they had been valued on a lower of first-in-first-out ( FIFO ) cost or market basis. The total carrying value of the segment inventory accounted for under the LIFO method is $6.1 billion and $5.6 billion at August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

The Company s Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments  inventory is accounted for using the FIFO method, except for retail inventory in the Retail Pharmacy International segment, which is primarily determined using the retail inventory method. Under the retail inventory method, cost is determined by applying a calculated cost-to-retail ratio across groupings of similar items. The cost-to-retail ratio is applied to ending inventory at its current owned retail valuation to determine the cost of ending inventory across groupings of similar items. Current owned retail valuation represents the retail price for which merchandise is offered for sale on a regular basis. Inherent in the retail method calculation are certain management judgments and estimates which can impact the owned retail valuation and, therefore, the ending inventory valuation at cost. The total carrying value of the inventory for Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments is $2.9 billion and $3.1 billion at August 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Equity Method Investments

The Company uses the equity method to account for investments in companies if the investment provides the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over operating and financial policies of the investee. The Company s proportionate share of the net income or loss of these companies is included in consolidated net earnings. Judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investment includes considering key factors such as the Company s ownership interest, representation on the board of directors, participation in policy-making decisions and material intercompany transactions.

See Note 5, Equity Method Investments for further information relating to the Company s equity method investments.

Investments

The Company s investments consist principally of corporate debt, other debt securities, and equity securities of publicly-traded companies.

The Company classifies its investments in securities at the time of purchase as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, and re-evaluates such classifications on a quarterly basis. Held-to-maturity investments consist of debt securities that the Company has the intent and ability to hold until maturity. These securities are recorded at cost, adjusted for the amortization of premiums and discounts, which approximates fair value. Available-for-sale debt and equity securities are recorded at fair value. Unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale investments are excluded from earnings and are reported as a separate component of shareholders  equity and comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains and losses of available-for-sale investments are included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The Company evaluates these investments for other-than-temporary impairment. Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost; (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness, and near-term prospects of the issuer; (iii) the length of time to maturity; (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts; (v) the Company s intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value; and (vi) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of fair value.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of owned assets. Estimated useful lives range from 20 years for land improvements, 3 to 50 for buildings and building improvements and 3 to 20 for fixtures, plant and equipment. Leasehold improvements, equipment under capital lease and capital lease properties are amortized over their respective estimate of useful life or over the term of the lease, whichever is shorter. Major repairs, which extend the useful life of an asset, are capitalized; routine maintenance and repairs are charged against earnings. The majority of the Company s fixtures and equipment uses the composite method of depreciation. Therefore, gains and losses on retirement or other disposition of such assets are included in earnings only when an operating location is closed, substantially remodeled or impaired. Property, plant and equipment consists of (in millions):

Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2016, $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015 and $923 million in fiscal 2014.

The Company capitalizes application stage development costs for significant internally developed software projects, such as upgrades to the store point-of-sale system. These costs are amortized over a three to eight year period. Amortization expense for capitalized system development costs and software was $238 million in fiscal 2016, $178 million in fiscal 2015 and $127 million in fiscal 2014. Unamortized costs at August 31, 2016 and 2015 were $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively.

Business Combinations

Business combinations are accounted for under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 805, Business Combinations, using the acquisition method of accounting. The cost of an acquired company is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets purchased and the liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition. The determination of fair values of assets and liabilities acquired requires estimates and the use of valuation techniques when a market value is not readily available. Any excess of purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired is allocated to goodwill. The final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities is completed within the one year measurement period as allowed under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. Transaction costs associated with business combinations are expensed as they are incurred.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company accounts for goodwill and intangibles under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles   Goodwill and Other, which requires the Company to test goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may exist.

Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives. See Note 8, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for additional disclosure regarding the Company s intangible assets.

Warrants

The warrants to acquire shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation  were  accounted for as a derivative under ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The Company reports its warrants at fair value within other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and changes in the fair value of warrants are recognized in other income in the Consolidated  Statements  of Earnings. A deferred credit from the day-one valuation attributable to the warrants granted to Walgreens  was  amortized over the life of the warrants. See Note 10, Financial Instruments, for additional disclosure regarding the Company s warrants.

Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and currency risks arising from operating and financing activities. In accordance with its risk management policies, the Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

When the Company becomes a party to a derivative instrument and intends to apply hedge accounting, it formally documents the hedge relationship and the risk management objective for undertaking the hedge which includes designating the instrument for financial reporting purposes as a fair value hedge, a cash flow hedge, or a net investment hedge. The accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the Company had designated it in a qualifying hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship. The Company applies the following accounting policies:

Changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a fair value hedge, along with the gain or loss on the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk, are recorded in the Consolidated  Statements  of Earnings.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated  Statements  of Comprehensive Income and reclassified into earnings in the period or periods during which the hedged item affects earnings.

The effective portion of changes in the fair value of a derivative designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is recorded in cumulative translation adjustments within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated  Statements  of Comprehensive Income. Recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation adjustments is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged investments in foreign operations.

Changes in the fair value of a derivative not designated in a hedging relationship are recognized in the Consolidated  Statements  of Earnings along with the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated in hedging relationships.

Cash receipts or payments on a settlement of a derivative contract are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows consistent with the nature of the underlying hedged item.

For derivative instruments designated as hedges, the Company assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Highly effective means that cumulative changes in the fair value of the derivative are between 80% and 125% of the cumulative changes in the fair value of the hedged item. In addition, when the Company determines that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, hedge accounting is discontinued. When it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur, the Company discontinues hedge accounting for the affected portion of the forecasted transaction, and reclassifies any gains or losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings. When a derivative in a hedge relationship is terminated or the hedged item is sold, extinguished or terminated, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.

Impaired Assets

The Company tests long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that a certain asset may be impaired. Once identified, the amount of the impairment is computed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the fair value, which is based on the discounted estimated future cash flows. Impairment charges included in selling, general and administrative expenses were  $305  million in fiscal 2016, primarily related to the Company s Cost Transformation Program (as defined below). Impairment charges recognized in fiscal 2015 and 2014 were  $ 386 million and  $ 167 million, respectively.

Liabilities for Store Closings

The Company provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. The reserve for store closings, including $ 91  million from locations closed under the Company s restructuring actions, was $466 million as of August 31, 2016 and $446 million as of August 31, 2015. See Note 4, Leases for additional disclosure regarding the Company s reserve for future costs related to closed locations.

Pension and Postretirement Benefits

The Company has various defined benefit pension plans that cover some of its foreign employees. The Company also has postretirement healthcare plans that cover qualifying domestic employees. Eligibility and the level of benefits for these plans vary depending participants  status, date of hire and or length of service. Pension and postretirement expenses and valuations are dependent on assumptions used by third party actuaries in calculating those amounts. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trends, long-term return on plan assets, retirement rates, mortality rates and other factors. See Note 15, Retirement Benefits, for additional disclosure regarding the Company s pension and postretirement benefits.

Table of Contents 

The Company funds its pension plans in accordance with applicable regulations.

Noncontrolling Interests

The Company accounts for its less than 100% interest in consolidated subsidiaries in accordance with ASC Topic 810, Consolidation, and accordingly, the Company presents noncontrolling interests as a component of equity on its Consolidated Balance Sheets and reports the noncontrolling interest net earnings or loss as Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

Currency

Assets and liabilities of non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates while revenues, expenses and cash flows are translated at average monthly exchange rates over the period. Equity is translated at historical exchange rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For U.S. dollar functional currency operations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured from historical exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are recorded at average monthly exchange rates over the period, except for those expenses related to nonmonetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured from historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement and transactions are included in selling, general and administrative expenses within the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. For all periods presented, there were no material operational gains or losses from foreign currency transactions.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (iii) the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The following revenue recognition policies have been established for the Company s reportable segments.

Retail Pharmacy USA and Retail Pharmacy International

The Company recognizes revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise, after making appropriate adjustments for estimated returns. Revenue does not include sales related taxes. In certain international locations, the Company initially estimates revenue based on expected reimbursements from governmental agencies for dispensing prescription drugs and providing optical services. The estimates are based on historical experience and are updated to actual reimbursement amounts.

Pharmaceutical Wholesale

Wholesale revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods, which is generally also the day of delivery. When the Company acts in the capacity of an agent or a logistics service provider, revenue is the fee received for the service and is recognized when the services have been performed. The Company has determined it is the agent when providing logistics services, which is based on its assessment of the following criteria: (i) whether it is the primary obligor in the arrangement, (ii) whether it has latitude in establishing the price, changing the product or performing part of the service, (iii) whether it has discretion in supplier selection, (iv) whether it is involved in the determination of service specifications, and (v) whether it is exposed to credit risk.

Cost of Sales

Cost of sales includes the purchase price of goods and services sold, store and warehouse inventory loss, inventory obsolescence, manufacturing costs, certain direct product design and development costs and supplier rebates. In addition to product costs, cost of sales includes manufacturing costs, warehousing costs for retail operations, purchasing costs, freight costs, cash discounts and vendor allowances. Cost of sales for our Retail Pharmacy USA segment is derived based upon point-of-sale scanning information with an estimate for shrinkage and is adjusted based on periodic inventory counts.

Vendor Allowances and Supplier Rebates

Vendor allowances are principally received as a result of purchases, sales or promotion of vendors  products. Allowances are generally recorded as a reduction of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the related merchandise is sold. Those allowances received for promoting vendors  products are offset against advertising expense and result in a reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses to the extent of advertising costs incurred, with the excess treated as a reduction of inventory costs.

Rebates or refunds received by the Company from its suppliers, mostly in cash, are considered as an adjustment of the prices of the supplier s products purchased by the Company.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense s

Selling, general and administrative expenses mainly consist of salaries and employee costs, occupancy costs, depreciation and amortization, credit and debit card fees and expenses directly related to stores. In addition, other costs included are headquarters  expenses, advertising costs (net of vendor advertising allowances), wholesale warehousing costs and insurance.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs, which are reduced by the portion funded by vendors, are expensed as incurred or when services have been received. Net advertising expenses, which are included in selling, general and administrative expenses, were $598 million in fiscal 2016, $491 million in fiscal 2015 and $265 million in fiscal 2014.

Points Earned Through Loyalty Programs

The Companys primary rewards programs. Balance  Rewards and Boots Advantage Card, are accrued as a charge to cost of sales at the time a point is earned. Points are funded internally and through vendor participation, and   are credited to cost of sales at the time a vendor-sponsored point is earned. Breakage is recorded as points expire as a result of a member s inactivity or if the points remain unredeemed after three years. Breakage income, which is reported in cost of sales, was not significant in fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014. 

Insurance

The Company obtains insurance coverage for catastrophic exposures as well as those risks required by law to be insured. In general, the Company s U.S. subsidiaries retain a significant portion of losses related to workers  compensation, property, comprehensive general, pharmacist and vehicle liability, while non-U.S. subsidiaries manage their exposures through insurance coverage with third-party carriers. Management regularly reviews the probable outcome of claims and proceedings, the expenses expected to be incurred, the availability and limits of the insurance coverage, and the established accruals for liabilities. Liabilities for losses are recorded based upon the Company s estimates for both claims incurred and claims incurred but not reported and are not discounted. The provisions are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions.

Stock Compensation Plans

In accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation, the Company recognizes compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the employee s vesting period or to the employee s retirement eligible date, if earlier. See Note 14, Stock Compensation Plans for more information on the Company s stock-based compensation plans.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes according to the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured pursuant to tax laws using rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized.

In determining the provision for income taxes, the Company uses income, permanent differences between book and tax income, the relative proportion of foreign and domestic income, enacted statutory income tax rates, projections of income subject to Subpart F rules and unrecognized tax benefits related to current year results. Discrete events such as the assessment of the ultimate outcome of tax audits, audit settlements, recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits due to lapsing of the applicable statute of limitations, recognizing or de-recognizing benefits of deferred tax assets due to future year financial statement projections and changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.

The Company is subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business. U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities raise questions regarding the Company s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the tax benefits associated with the various tax filing positions, the Company records a tax benefit for uncertain tax positions using the highest cumulative tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. Adjustments are made to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the period in which the Company determines the issue is effectively settled with the tax authorities, the statute of limitations expires for the return containing the tax position or when more information becomes available.

Earnings Per Share

The dilutive effect of outstanding stock options on earnings per share is calculated using the treasury stock method. Stock options are anti-dilutive and excluded from the earnings per share calculation if the exercise price exceeds the average market price of the common shares. Outstanding options to purchase common shares that were anti-dilutive and excluded from earnings per share totaled 2.5 million, 2.5 million and 3.5 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. This ASU addresses the classification of certain specific cash flow issues including debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of certain debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of certain insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The Company is currently evaluating the effect this ASU will have on our consolidated statement of cash flows.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. This ASU amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019 (fiscal 2021), including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This ASU simplifies the employee share-based payment accounting of stock compensation, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term must be applied prospectively. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement must be applied retrospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. This ASU is effective for annual periods after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is early adopting this guidance at the beginning of Fiscal 2017 and does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company s reults of operations, cash flows or financial position.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04, Liabilities   Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products. This ASU addresses diversity in practice related to the de-recognition of a prepaid store-value product liability. The ASU  amends the guidance on extinguishing financial liabilities for certain prepaid store-value products. If an entity selling prepaid store-value products expects to be entitled to an amount that will not be redeemed, the entity will recognize the expected breakage in proportion to the pattern of rights expected to be exercised by the product holder to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the breakage amount will not subsequently occur. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019), and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted, including adoption before the effective date of ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (described below). The amendments in this ASU should be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the effect the ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which supersedes Topic 840, Leases. This ASU increases the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. At the lease commencement date, lessee recognizes a lease liability and right-of-use asset, which is initially measured at the present value of future lease payments. There are two approaches for amortizing the right-of use asset. Under the finance lease approach, interest on the lease liability is recognized separately from amortization of the right-of-use asset. Repayments of the principal portion of the lease liability will be classified as financing activities and payments of interest on the lease liability and variable lease payments will be classified as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Under the operating lease approach, the cost of the lease is calculated on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term. All cash payments are classified as operating activities in the statement of cash flows. For sale and leaseback transactions, in order for a sale to occur, the transfer of the asset must meet all criteria in Topic 606. If there is no sale for the seller-lessee, the buyer-lessor does not account for a purchase. Any consideration paid for the asset is accounted for as a financing transaction. For transactions previously accounted for as a sale and leaseback, the transition guidance in Topic 842 does not require an entity to assess whether the transaction would have qualified as a sale and a leaseback in accordance with Topic 842. Additionally, gains recorded under sale and leaseback transactions are recognized at the transaction date and no longer deferred over the lease term. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (fiscal 2020). In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. The Company has begun evaluating and planning for the adoption and implementation of this ASU, including assessing the overall impact. This ASU will have a material impact on the Company s financial position. The impact on the Company s results of operations is being evaluated. The impact of this ASU is non-cash in nature and will not affect the Company s cash position.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10). This ASU requires equity investments (except those under the equity method of accounting or those that result in the consolidation of an investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. This simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments previous held at cost. Separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category is required. This ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019). Early application is permitted, for fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance.

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740). This ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current in a classified statement of financial position. This ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax assets and liabilities, or retrospectively to all periods presented for annual periods beginning after December 16, 2016 and interim periods thereafter (fiscal 2018), with early adoption permitted, and may require additional disclosure based on the application method selected. The Company  prospectively  early adopted this ASU in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The adoption did not result in a material reclassification in our statement of financial position.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), an update to ASU 2014-09. This ASU amends ASU 2014-09 to defer the effective date by one year for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (fiscal 2019). Subsequently, the FASB has also issued accounting standards updates which clarify the guidance. This ASU removes inconsistencies, complexities and allows transparency and comparability of revenue transactions across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets by providing a single comprehensive principles-based model with additional disclosures regarding uncertainties. The principles-based revenue recognition model has a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 (fiscal 2018). In transition, the ASU may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance including the transition method.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330). This ASU simplifies current accounting treatments by requiring entities to measure most inventories at  the lower of cost and net realizable value  rather than using lower of cost or market. This guidance does not apply to inventories measured using last-in, first-out method or the retail inventory method. This ASU is effective prospectively for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods thereafter (fiscal 2018) with early adoption permitted. Upon transition, entities must disclose the accounting change. The Company is evaluating the effect of adopting this new accounting guidance but does not expect adoption will have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

3. Restructuring 

On April 8, 2015, the Walgreens Boots Alliance Board of Directors approved a plan to implement a new restructuring program (the  Cost Transformation Program ) as part of an initiative to reduce costs and increase operating efficiencies. The Cost Transformation Program implemented and built on the cost-reduction initiative previously announced by the Company on August 6, 2014 and included plans to close stores across the U.S.; reorganize corporate and field operations; drive operating efficiencies; and streamline information technology and other functions.  The actions under the Cost Transformation Program focus primarily on the Retail Pharmacy USA segment, but includes activities from all segments and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of the Company s 2017 fiscal year. The Company estimates that it will recognize cumulative pre-tax charges to its GAAP financial results of between $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, including costs associated with lease obligations and other real estate payments, asset impairments and employee termination and other business transition and exit costs.  The Company incurred pre-tax charges of $424 million related to the Cost Transformation Program during fiscal 2016.    The Company incurred pre-tax charges of $542 million related to the Cost Transformation Program in fiscal 2015. From inception through August 31, 2016, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of  $966 million ($448 million related to asset impairment charges, $293 million in real estate costs and $225 million in severance and other business transition and exit costs) related to the Cost Transformation Program. All charges related to the Cost Transformation Program have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses.  Restructuring charges are recognized as the costs are incurred over time in accordance with GAAP.

In March 2014, the Walgreens Board of Directors approved a plan to close underperforming stores in efforts to optimize and focus resources  within the Retail Pharmacy USA segment  in a manner intended to increase stockholder value. As of August 31, 2015, this plan was completed and no additional charges related to the plan are expected. For fiscal 2015, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $17 million, which were primarily related to lease termination costs.   In fiscal 2014, the Company incurred pre-tax charges of $209 million.   All charges related to this plan have been recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Restructuring costs by segment are as follows (in millions):

4. Leases 

Initial terms for leased premises in the U.S. are typically 15 to 25 years, followed by additional terms containing renewal options at five-year intervals, and may include rent escalation clauses. Non-U.S. leases are typically for shorter terms and may include cancellation clauses or renewal options. The commencement date of all lease terms is the earlier of the date the Company becomes legally obligated to make rent payments or the date the Company has the right to control the property. The Company recognizes rent expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. In addition to minimum fixed rentals, some leases provide for contingent rentals based upon a portion of sales.

The Company continuously evaluates its real estate portfolio in conjunction with its capital needs. The Company has entered into several sale-leaseback transactions. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions of $60 million, $867 million and $67 million, respectively. In other transactions, the Company negotiated fixed rate renewal options which constitute a form of continuing involvement, resulting in the assets remaining on the balance sheet and a corresponding finance lease obligation.

Annual minimum rental commitments under all leases having an initial or remaining non-cancelable term of more than one year are shown below (in millions):

The capital and finance lease amounts include $1.7 billion of imputed interest and executory costs. Total minimum lease payments have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $199 million on leases due in the future under non-cancelable subleases.

The Company provides for future costs related to closed locations. The liability is based on the present value of future rent obligations and other related costs (net of estimated sublease rent) to the first lease option date. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company recorded charges of $127 million, $252 million and $177 million, respectively, for facilities that were closed or relocated under long-term leases, including stores closed through the Company s store optimization plan and Cost Transformation Program. These charges are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

5. Equity Method Investments 

Equity method investments as of August 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions, except percentages):

AmerisourceBergen Investment

On March 18, 2016, the Company exercised warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen Corporation ( AmerisourceBergen ) common stock at an exercise price of $51.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.17 billion. On August 25, 2016, the Company exercised additional warrants to purchase 22,696,912 shares of AmerisourceBergen common stock at an exercise price of $52.50 per share for an aggregate exercise price payment of $1.19 billion. As of August 31, 2016, the Company owned 56,854,867 AmerisourceBergen common shares representing approximately 24% of the outstanding AmerisourceBergen common stock and accounts for its equity investment in AmerisourceBergen using the equity method of accounting, with the net earnings attributable to the Company s investment being classified within the operating income of its Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment.  Due to the timing and availability of financial information of AmerisourceBergen, we account for this equity method investment on a financial  reporting lag  of two months.  Due to the change in accounting method to equity method effective March 18, 2016 and the two-month reporting lag, the Company s results for fiscal 2016 include approximately three and a half months of equity method income. Equity earnings from AmerisourceBergen is reported as a separate line in the Consolidated  Statements  of Earnings. The  level 1  fair market value of the Company s equity investment in AmerisourceBergen common stock at August 31, 2016 is $4.9 billion.

The Company s investment in AmerisourceBergen carrying value exceeded its proportionate share of the net assets of AmerisourceBergen by $4.5 billion. This premium of $4.5 billion was recognized as part of the carrying value in the Company s equity investment in AmerisourceBergen. The difference was primarily related to goodwill and the fair value of AmerisourceBergen intangible assets.

Other Investments

The Company s other equity method investments include its investments in Guangzhou Pharmaceuticals Corporation and Nanjing Pharmaceutical Corporation Limited, the Company s pharmaceutical wholesale investments in China; and the equity method investment retained through the sale of a majority interest in Option Care Inc. in fiscal 2015. The Company reported $44 million and $24 million of post-tax equity earnings from equity method investments other than AmerisourceBergen and Alliance Boots for fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. Post-tax equity earnings from the historical Walgreens other equity method investments in fiscal 2014 were immaterial.

Also in fiscal 2015, the Company accounted for its 45% investment in Alliance Boots using the equity method of accounting. The Company utilized a three-month reporting lag in recording equity income in Alliance Boots, which was eliminated on December 31, 2014. The Company s share of Alliance Boots earnings was recorded as Equity earnings in Alliance Boots in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The Company s investment was recorded as Equity investment in Alliance Boots in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Second Step Transaction closed on December 31, 2014, resulting in the acquisition by the Company of 55% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Alliance Boots, increasing its interest to 100%. The Company previously accounted for its 45% interest in Alliance Boots as an equity method investment.

As a result of the closing of the Second Step Transaction, the Company increased its ownership in WBAD, a global sourcing enterprise between Walgreens and Alliance Boots, to 100%. Because Walgreens held, prior to the Second Step Transaction, a 50% direct interest and an additional indirect interest in WBAD through its 45% ownership of Alliance Boots, the financial results of WBAD were fully consolidated into the Walgreens financial statements with the remaining 27.5% effective interest being recorded as a noncontrolling interest. The acquisition of the 27.5% noncontrolling interest was accounted for as an equity transaction with no gain or loss recorded in the statement of earnings under ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. On January 1, 2015, WBAD Holdings Limited sold 320 common shares of WBAD, representing approximately 5% of the equity interests in WBAD, to Alliance Healthcare Italia Distribuzione S.p.A. ( AHID ), which is not a member of the Company s consolidated group. Under certain circumstances, AHID has the right to put, and WBAD Holdings Limited has the right to call, the 320 common shares of WBAD currently owned by AHID for a purchase price of $100,000.

The Company has completed the purchase accounting of the Second Step Transaction. The total purchase price of the Second Step Transaction of $15.9 billion included  3.133 billion in cash ($4.9 billion at the December 31, 2014 spot rate of $1.56 to  1.00) and 144.3 million of the Company s common shares at a fair value of $11.0 billion (based on the December 30, 2014 closing market price of $76.05). Of the total purchase price, $13.3 billion was allocated to acquire the 55% ownership interest in Alliance Boots and $2.6 billion was allocated to acquire the noncontrolling interest in WBAD. The purchase price attributed to the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest in WBAD was determined based on the relative fair value of Alliance Boots and WBAD, respectively.

The following table summarizes the consideration paid to acquire the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots and the amounts of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the Second Step Transaction (in millions).

As a result of the Company acquiring the remaining 55% interest in Alliance Boots, the Company s previously held 45% interest was re-measured at fair value, resulting in a gain of $563 million. The gain has been recognized as Gain on previously held equity interest in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015.

The fair value of the previously held equity interest of $8.1 billion in Alliance Boots was determined using the income approach methodology. The fair value for trade names and trademarks was determined using the relief from royalty method of the income approach; pharmacy licenses and customer relationships were determined using the excess earnings method of the income approach; and loyalty card holders were determined using the incremental cash flow method, which is a form of the income approach. Personal property fair values were determined primarily using the indirect cost approach, while real property fair values were determined using the income, market and/or cost approach. The fair value measurements of the previously held equity interest and intangible assets are based on significant inputs not observable in the market, and thus represent Level 3 measurements. The fair value estimates for the previously held equity interest and intangible assets are based on (i) projected discounted cash flows, (ii) historical and projected financial information, (iii) synergies including cost savings, and (iv) attrition rates, as relevant, that market participants would consider when estimating fair values.

The identified definite and indefinite lived intangible assets were as follows:

The goodwill of $14.9 billion arising from the Second Step Transaction primarily reflects the expected purchasing synergies, operating efficiencies by benchmarking performance and applying best practices across the Company, consolidation of operations, reductions in selling, general and administrative expenses and combining workforces.

Following the completion of the Second Step Transaction, the Company realigned its operations into three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The Company determined that the goodwill should be allocated across all segments recognizing that each segment will benefit from the expected synergies.

The goodwill allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA segment of $7.3 billion is comprised of $3.5 billion of synergy benefits allocable to the segment on a source of procurement benefit basis and $3.8 billion determined on a  with-and-without  basis. The source of procurement benefit basis allocates the synergy benefits to the segment whose purchase gave rise to the benefit. The  with-and-without  basis computes the difference between the fair value of the pre-existing business before the combination and its fair value after the combination.

Of the remaining goodwill, $3.9 billion was allocated to the Retail Pharmacy International segment and $3.7 billion was allocated to the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Substantially all of the goodwill recognized is not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

The Company incurred legal and other professional services costs related to the Second Step Transaction, which were included in selling, general and administrative expenses, of $87 million in fiscal 2015.

The fair value of the assets acquired includes inventory having an estimated fair value of $3.7 billion. This fair value includes a $106 million fair value adjustment to capitalize the estimated profit in acquired finished goods inventory as of the date of the Second Step Transaction, which was expensed to cost of sales over the first inventory turn.

The following table presents supplemental unaudited condensed pro forma consolidated information for 2015 and 2014 as if the Second Step Transaction had occurred on September 1, 2013, the first day of the Company s fiscal 2014. The unaudited condensed pro forma information reflect certain adjustments related to past operating performance and acquisition accounting adjustments, such as increased amortization expense based on the fair valuation of assets acquired, the impact of acquisition financing, transaction costs and the related income tax effects. The unaudited condensed pro forma information does not include any anticipated synergies that may be achievable subsequent to the date of the Second Step Transaction. The unaudited condensed pro forma information also excludes certain non-recurring items such as transaction related costs. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed pro forma information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and is not intended to be indicative of what the Company s results would have been had the Second Step Transaction occurred at the beginning of the periods presented or the results which may occur in the future.

Other Acquisitions and Divestitures

The aggregate purchase price of all business and intangible assets acquired, net of cash received, was $126 million for fiscal 2016. These acquisitions included an international beauty brand and prescription files resulting in an increase of $23 million to goodwill and $95 million to intangible assets. The remaining fair value relates to immaterial amounts of tangible assets, less liabilities assumed and contingent considerations.  Operating results of the businesses acquired have been included in the Consolidated  Statements  of Earnings from their respective acquisition dates forward. Pro forma results of the Company, assuming all of the other acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported.

The aggregate purchase price of all businesses acquired in fiscal 2015, excluding Alliance Boots, net of cash received was $371 million for fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, the Company acquired Liz Earle Beauty Co. Ltd, owner of the Liz Earle skincare brand in addition to other asset acquisitions, primarily pharmacy prescription files. These acquisitions resulted in an increase of $126 million to goodwill and $255 million to intangible assets. Any remaining fair value relates to immaterial amounts of tangible assets, less liabilities assumed. Operating results of the businesses acquired have been included in the Consolidated  Statements  of Earnings from their respective acquisition dates forward. Pro forma results of the Company, assuming all of the other acquisitions had occurred at the beginning of each period presented, would not be materially different from the results reported.  Additionally, in fiscal 2015 the Company completed the sale of a majority interest in its subsidiary, Walgreens Infusion Services to Madison Dearborn Partners ( MDP ).   Walgreens Infusion Services became a new independent, privately-held company named Option Care Inc. 

8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually during the fourth quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. As part of the Company s impairment analysis, we determined fair value for each reporting unit using both the income and market approaches. The income approach requires management to estimate a number of factors for each reporting unit, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows and discount rates. The market approach estimates fair value using comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping. Based on the results of our testing, the fair values of each of the reporting units and other indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying values, therefore, no impairment was recognized.

The determination of the fair value of the reporting units and the allocation of that value to individual assets and   liabilities within those reporting units requires the Company to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to; the selection of appropriate peer g  roup   companies; control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which the Company competes; the   discount rate; terminal growth rates; and forecasts of revenue, operating income, depreciation and amortization and  capital expenditures. The allocation requires analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including, among other things, trade names and trademarks, pharmacy licenses, customer relationships and purchased prescription files. Although the Company believes its estimates of fair value are reasonable, actual financial results could differ from those estimates due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making such estimates. Changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of the goodwill impairment charge, or both.

The Company utilizes foreign currency forward contracts and other foreign currency derivatives to hedge significant committed and highly probable future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company or its subsidiaries. The Company has significant non-US dollar denominated net investments and uses foreign currency denominated financial instruments, specifically foreign currency derivatives and foreign currency denominated debt, to hedge its foreign currency risk.

Fair Value Hedges

In fiscal 2015, the Company entered into a series of interest rate swaps, converting $750 million of its 5.250% fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the six-month LIBOR in arrears plus a constant spread and an interest rate swap converting $250 million of its 5.250% fixed rate notes to a floating interest rate based on the one-month LIBOR in arrears plus a constant spread. All swap termination dates coincide with the notes maturity date, January 15, 2019. These swaps were designated as fair value hedges. On August 10, 2015, the Company terminated $500 million of the six-month LIBOR in arrears swaps and all of the one-month LIBOR in arrears swaps in connection with the repayment of the associated debt.

11. Fair Value Measurements 

The Company measures certain assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, which defines fair value as the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In addition, it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels:

- 78 - 

Table of Contents 

Level 1 - 
 
 Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets and liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs.

Level 2 - 
 
 Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets.

Level 3 - 
 
 Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):

(1)  
 
 Restricted cash consists of deposits restricted under agency agreements and cash restricted by law and other obligations.

(2)  
 
 Money market funds are valued at the closing price reported by the fund sponsor.

(3)  
 
 Fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices as of the balance sheet dates. See Note 6, Available-for-Sale Investments for additional information.

(4)  
 
 The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated by discounting the estimated cash flows received and paid based on the applicable observable yield curves. See Note 10, Financial Instruments for additional information.

(5)  
 
 The fair value of basis swaps and forward currency contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current available forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using observable market rates.

(6)  
 
 Warrants were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation. Key assumptions used in the valuation include risk-free interest rates using constant maturity treasury rates; the dividend yield for AmerisourceBergen s common stock; AmerisourceBergen s common stock price at the valuation date; AmerisourceBergen s equity volatility; the number of shares of AmerisourceBergen s common stock outstanding; the number of AmerisourceBergen employee stock options and the exercise price; and the details specific to the warrants.

There were no transfers between levels in fiscal 2016 or 2015.

The Company reports its debt instruments under the guidance of ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments, which requires disclosure of the fair value of the Company s debt in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements. Unless otherwise noted, the fair value for all notes was determined based upon quoted market prices and therefore categorized as Level 1. See Note 9, Borrowings for further details. The carrying values of accounts receivable and trade accounts payable approximated their respective fair values due to their short-term nature.

12. Commitments and Contingencies 

The Company is involved in legal proceedings and is subject to investigations, inspections, audits, inquiries and similar actions by governmental authorities, arising in the normal course of the Company s business, including the matters described below. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities and class action litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be determined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. From time to time, the Company is also involved in legal proceedings as a plaintiff involving antitrust, tax, contract, intellectual property and other matters. Gain contingencies, if any, are recognized when they are realized. The results of legal proceedings are often uncertain and difficult to predict, and the costs incurred in litigation can be substantial, regardless of the outcome. The Company believes that its defenses and assertions in pending legal proceedings have merit, and does not believe that any of these pending matters, after consideration of applicable reserves and rights to indemnification, will have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position. However, substantial unanticipated verdicts, fines and rulings do sometimes occur. As a result, the Company could from time to time incur judgments, enter into settlements or revise its expectations regarding the outcome of certain matters, and such developments could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations in the period in which the amounts are accrued and/or its cash flows in the period in which the amounts are paid.

On a quarterly basis, the Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies for outstanding legal proceedings and reserves are established on a case-by-case basis for those legal claims for which management concludes that it is probable that a loss will be incurred and that the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Substantially all of these contingencies are subject to significant uncertainties and, therefore, determining the likelihood of a loss and/or the measurement of any loss can be complex. With respect to litigation and other legal proceedings where the Company has determined that a loss is reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the amount or range of reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts reserved due to the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of and uncertainties regarding such litigation and legal proceedings. The Company s assessments are based on estimates and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by management, but that may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause the Company to change those estimates and assumptions. Therefore, it is possible that an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending litigation or other contingencies could have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements in a future fiscal period. Management s assessment of current litigation and other legal proceedings, including the corresponding accruals, could change because of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions or other proceedings pending against the Company which are not presently known. Adverse rulings or determinations by judges, juries, governmental authorities or other parties could also result in changes to management s assessment of current liabilities and contingencies. Accordingly, the ultimate costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved.

On December 5 and 12, 2014, putative shareholders filed class actions in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against the Walgreens Board of Directors, Walgreen Co., and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. arising out of the Company s definitive proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC in connection with the special meeting of Walgreens shareholders on December 29, 2014. The actions asserted claims that the definitive proxy statement/prospectus was false or misleading in various respects. On December 23, 2014, solely to avoid the costs, risks and uncertainties inherent in litigation, and without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, Walgreens entered into a memorandum of understanding with the plaintiffs in both actions, pursuant to which Walgreens made certain supplemental disclosures. The proposed settlement was subject to, among other things, court approval. On July 8, 2015, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement, and on November 20, 2015, the Court entered an order of final approval of the settlement. On December 17, 2015, a purported class member who had objected to the settlement appealed the Court s order. The appeal was docketed with the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Oral argument was held on June 2, 2016. On August 10, 2016, the Seventh Circuit issued an order reversing the district court s judgment approving the settlement and remanding the case for further proceedings.

On December 29, 2014, a putative shareholder filed a derivative action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against certain current and former directors and officers of Walgreen Co., and Walgreen Co. as a nominal defendant, arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. The action asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste and unjust enrichment. On April 10, 2015, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On May 18, 2015, the case was stayed in light of the securities class action that was filed on April 10, 2015, which is described below.

On April 10, 2015, a putative shareholder filed a securities class action in federal court in the Northern District of Illinois against Walgreen Co. and certain former officers of Walgreen Co. The action asserts claims for violation of the federal securities laws arising out of certain public statements the Company made regarding its former fiscal 2016 goals. On June 16, 2015, the Court entered an order appointing a lead plaintiff. Pursuant to the Court s order, lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on August 17, 2015, and defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint on October 16, 2015. Lead plaintiff filed a response to the motion to dismiss on December 22, 2015, and defendants filed a reply in support of the motion on February 5, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part Walgreen Co. s motion to dismiss.

As of August 31, 2016, the Company was aware of   ten   putative class action lawsuits (the  Rite Aid actions ) filed by purported Rite Aid stockholders against Rite Aid and its board of directors, Walgreens Boots Alliance and  Victoria Merger Sub, Inc.  for claims arising out of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the  Rite Aid Transactions ).   Eight   of the Rite Aid actions were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the  Delaware actions ),   one   Rite Aid action was filed in the State of Pennsylvania in the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland County (the  Pennsylvania action ), and   one   Rite Aid action was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (the  federal action ). The Delaware actions and the Pennsylvania action primarily allege that the Rite Aid board of directors breached its fiduciary duties in connection with the Rite Aid Transactions by, among other things, agreeing to an unfair and inadequate price, agreeing to deal protection devices that preclude other bidders from making successful competing offers for Rite Aid, and failing to disclose all allegedly material information concerning the proposed merger; and also allege that Walgreens Boots Alliance and  Victoria Merger Sub, Inc.  aided and abetted these alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. The federal action alleges, among other things, that Rite Aid and its board of directors disseminated an allegedly false and misleading proxy statement in connection with the Rite Aid Transactions. The Delaware actions were consolidated, and plaintiffs filed a motion for expedited proceedings and a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Rite Aid shareholder vote on the Rite Aid Transactions. The plaintiffs in the federal action also filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the same Rite Aid shareholder vote. All such motions were denied, and the Rite Aid shareholders approved the Rite Aid Transactions at a special meeting on February 4, 2016. On April 15, 2016, the plaintiffs in the Delaware actions agreed to a settlement in principle related to this matter for an immaterial amount. In the Pennsylvania action, plaintiffs agreed to stay the litigation until after the Rite Aid Transactions have closed.

 Upon the amendment and immediate exercise of the call option to acquire the remaining 55% ownership of Alliance Boots, the Company was required to compare the fair value of the amended option with the book value of the original option with a gain or loss recognized for the difference. The fair value of the amended option resulted in a financial statement loss of $866 million. The loss on the Alliance Boots call option was, in part, a capital loss and available to be carried forward and offset future capital gains through fiscal 2020. In 2015, the deferred tax asset related to the loss was recognized, resulting in the 4.1% effective tax rate benefit reported in the table above.

The deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets consist of the following (in millions):

At August 31, 2016, the Company has recorded deferred tax assets of $373 million, primarily reflecting the benefit of $200 million in U.S. federal, $226 million in state and $837 million in non-U.S. ordinary and capital losses. In addition, these deferred tax assets include $55 million of income tax credits.  Of these deferred tax assets, $139 million will expire at various dates from 2017 through 2036. The residual deferred tax assets of $234 million have no expiry date.

The Company believes it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain deferred tax assets will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $305 million against those deferred tax assets as of August 31, 2016.

Income taxes paid were $1.1 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, provides guidance regarding the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure in the financial  statement  of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, including the decision whether to file in a particular jurisdiction. As of August 31, 2016, unrecognized tax benefits of $252 million were reported as long-term liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets while $51 million were reported as current tax liabilities. Both of these amounts include interest and penalties, when applicable.

Table of Contents 

The following table provides a reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits (in millions):

At August 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, $237 million, $227 million and $105 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. During the next twelve months, based on current knowledge, it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $51 million due to anticipated tax audit settlements and the expirations of statutes of limitations associated with tax positions related to multiple tax jurisdictions.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties in the income tax provision in its Consolidated  Statements  of Earnings. At August 31, 2016, and August 31, 2015, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $34 million and $36 million, respectively. For the year ended August 31, 2016, the amount reported in income tax expense related to interest and penalties was $2 million.

The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return as well as income tax returns in various states and multiple foreign jurisdictions. It is generally no longer under audit examination for U.S. federal income tax purposes for any years prior to fiscal 2015. With few exceptions, it is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal 2007. In foreign tax jurisdictions, the Company is generally no longer subject to examination by the tax authorities in Luxembourg prior to  2011 , in Germany prior to 2011, in France prior to  2011 , and in Turkey prior to  2011 . With respect to the United Kingdom, a number of specific issues remain open to examination by the tax authorities back to 2000.

The Company has received tax holidays from Swiss cantonal income taxes relative to certain of its Swiss operations. The income tax holidays are expected to extend through September 2022. The holidays had a beneficial impact of $116 million and $89 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. This benefit is primarily included as part of the foreign income taxed at non-U.S. rates line in the effective tax rate reconciliation table above.

At August 31, 2016, it is not practicable for the Company to determine the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability it has with respect to temporary differences related to investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures that are essentially permanent in duration.

14. Stock Compensation Plans 

The Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  Omnibus Plan ) which became effective in fiscal 2013, provides for incentive compensation to the Company s non-employee directors, officers and employees, and consolidates into a single plan several previously existing equity compensation plans.

The Company grants stock options, performance shares and restricted units under the Omnibus Plan. Performance shares issued under the Omnibus Plan offer performance-based incentive awards and equity-based awards to key employees.  The  fair value of each performance share granted assumes that performance goals will be achieved at 100 percent. If such goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any recognized compensation expense is reversed. Restricted stock units are also equity-based awards with performance requirements that are granted to key employees. The performance shares and restricted stock unit awards are both subject to restrictions as to continuous employment except in the case of death, normal retirement or total and permanent disability.

Total stock-based compensation expense for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $115 million, $109 million and $114 million, respectively. The recognized tax benefit was $21 million, $7 million and $31 million for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards at August 31, 2016, was $111 million. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of three years.

15. Retirement Benefits 

The Company sponsors several retirement plans, including defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans and a postretirement health plan.  Pursuant to the Second Step Transaction, the Company assumed a number of retirement benefit plans in the United Kingdom and other countries.  The Company valued the assumed pension assets and liabilities on the acquisition date and uses an August 31 annual measurement date for its pension and post-retirement plans.

Effective September 1, 2016, for UK and U.S. benefit plans using the yield curve approach, the Company will change the method used to calculate the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for pension and postretirement benefit plans and will measure these costs by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans  projected cash flows. The Company believes the new approach will provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations for those plans and will be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate, which is applied prospectively. This change is not expected to have a material impact to the 2017 full year results.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans (non-U.S. plans)

The principal defined benefit pension plan is the Boots Pension Plan covering certain employees in the United Kingdom (the  Boots Plan ). The Boots Plan is a funded final salary defined benefit plan providing pensions and death benefits to members. The Boots Plan was closed to future accrual effective July 1, 2010 with pensions calculated based on salaries up until that date. The Boots Plan is governed by a trustee board, which is independent of the Company. The plan is subject to a full funding actuarial valuation on a triennial basis.  The Company also has two smaller defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom, both of which were closed to future accruals effective July 1, 2010. 

Defined benefit pension plan assets were invested in the following classes of securities as of August 31:

The investment strategy of the principal defined benefit pension plan is to hold approximately 85% of its assets in a diverse portfolio of high quality bonds with the remainder invested in equity and real estate assets backing longer term liabilities. Interest rate and inflation rate swaps are also employed to complement the role of fixed and index-linked bond holdings in liability risk management.

The following table presents defined benefit pension plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of August 31, 2016 (in millions).

Defined Contribution Plans

The principal retirement plan for U.S. employees is the Walgreen Profit-Sharing Retirement Trust, to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The Company s contribution, which has historically related to adjusted FIFO earnings before interest and taxes and a portion of which is in the form of a guaranteed match, is determined annually at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The profit-sharing provision was an expense of $226  million, $ 158  million   and $355 million in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company s contributions were $225 million, $249 million and $328 million in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. 

The Company also has certain contract based defined contribution arrangements. The principal one is the Alliance Healthcare   Boots Retirement Savings Plan, which is United Kingdom based and to which both the Company and participating employees contribute. The cost related to these arrangements recognized in the Consolidated  Statement  of Earnings for fiscal 2016 was $130 million and from the date of the Second Step Transaction through August 31, 2015 was $93 million.

Postretirement Healthcare Plan

The Company provides certain health insurance benefits to retired U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements, including age, years of service and date of hire. The costs of these benefits are accrued over the service life of the employee. The Company s postretirement health benefit plan obligation was $466 and  $ 431 million  in fiscal 2016 and 2015  respectively and is not funded. The expected benefit to be paid net of the estimated federal subsidy during fiscal year 2017 is $11 million.

16. Capital Stock 

In connection with the Company s capital policy, the Board of Directors has authorized share repurchase programs. In August 2014, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the 2014 stock repurchase program which authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of the Company s common stock prior to its expiration on August 31, 2016. The Company purchased 1.3 million and 8.2 million shares under the 2014 stock repurchase program in fiscal 2016 and 2015 at a cost of $110 million and $726 million, respectively.

The Company determines the timing and amount of repurchases based on its assessment of various factors including prevailing market conditions, alternate uses of capital, liquidity, the economic environment and other factors. The timing and amount of these purchases may change at any time and from time to time. The Company has repurchased, and may from time to time in the future repurchase, shares on the open market through Rule 10b5-1 plans, which enable a company to repurchase shares at times when it otherwise might be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws.

In addition, the Company continued to repurchase shares to support the needs of the employee stock plans. Shares totaling $1.0 billion were purchased to support the needs of the employee stock plans during fiscal 2016 as compared to $500 million and $705 million in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. At August 31, 2016, 43.8 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuances under the Company s various employee benefit plans.

18. Segment Reporting 

Prior to December 31, 2014, the Company s operations were within one reportable segment. As a result of the closing of the Second Step Transaction on December 31, 2014, the Company has realigned its operations into three reportable segments: Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale. The operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Company s Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Company s operating segments, which have been aggregated as described below. The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. The chief operating decision maker does not use total assets by segment to make decisions regarding resources, therefore the total asset disclosure by segment has not been included.

The Retail Pharmacy USA segment consists of the legacy Walgreens business, which includes the operation of retail drugstores and convenient care clinics and the provision of specialty pharmacy services. Revenues for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and a wide assortment of general merchandise, including non-prescription drugs, beauty products, photo finishing, seasonal merchandise, greeting cards and convenience foods.

The Retail Pharmacy International segment consists primarily of the legacy Alliance Boots pharmacy-led health and beauty stores, optical practices, and related contract manufacturing operations. Stores are located in the United Kingdom, Mexico, Chile, Thailand, Norway, the Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands and Lithuania. Revenues for the segment are principally derived from the sale of prescription drugs and retail health, beauty, toiletries and other consumer products.

The Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment consists of the legacy Alliance Boots pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution businesses and an equity method investment in AmerisourceBergen reported on a two-month lag. Wholesale operations are located in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey, Spain, The Netherlands, Egypt, Norway, Romania, Czech Republic and Lithuania. Revenues for the segment are principally derived from wholesaling and distribution of a comprehensive offering of brand-name pharmaceuticals (including specialty pharmaceutical products) and generic pharmaceuticals, health and beauty products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to pharmacies and other healthcare providers.

The results of operations for each reportable segment include synergy benefits, including WBAD operations and an allocation of corporate-related overhead costs. The  Eliminations  column contains items not allocable to the reportable segments, as the information is not utilized by the chief operating decision maker to assess segment performance and allocate resources.

The segment information reflects the operating results of the Company s business segments. The Company began recording revenue and expense transactions using the new segments effective January 1, 2015. Beginning January 1, 2015, synergy benefits including WBAD operations have been allocated to the Retail Pharmacy USA, Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments on a source of procurement benefit basis. Under this method, the synergy benefits are allocated to the segment whose purchase gave rise to the benefit. A synergy arising on the purchase of an item for use in an entity in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment is recognized in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and similarly for the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments. Procurement service income related to third parties is recognized in the Pharmaceutical Wholesale segment. Corporate costs have been allocated to segments based on their respective gross profit.

The Company s Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments were acquired as part of the Second Step Transaction in which the Company acquired the 55% of Alliance Boots that it did not already own on December 31, 2014. The Company has determined that it is impracticable to restate segment information for periods prior the completion of the Second Step Transaction, as well as to provide disclosures for such periods under both the old basis and new basis of reporting for certain items. Specifically, WBAD operations prior to December 31, 2014 were recorded in the Retail Pharmacy USA segment and have not been restated, as the Company believes it is impracticable to separate the information to the individual reportable segments. Equity earnings from Alliance Boots prior to the completion of the Second Step Transaction has been recorded within the Retail Pharmacy USA segment. The equity earnings of the 45% interest in Alliance Boots have not been separated into the Retail Pharmacy International and Pharmaceutical Wholesale segments for the prior period, as the Company believes it is impracticable. Accordingly, only eight months of results (January to August 2015) have been reported for these segments for fiscal 2015. To improve comparability, certain classification changes have been made to prior period results , this  change has no impact on operating income.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Walgreens Boots Alliance,   Inc .  

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Walgreens Boots Alliance,   Inc. (successor to Walgreen   Co.) and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of August   31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated  statements  of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August   31, 2016. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.  We  did not audit the consolidated income  statement  of Alliance Boots GmbH ( Alliance Boots  ) for  the  year ended May 31, 2014,  which  the Company utilized  for  its accounting  of  its investment in Alliance Boots using  the equity method (see note  5  to the consolidated financial statements ), for the year ended August 31, 2014.  The accompanying 2014 consolidated financial  statements  of the Company include its equity earnings in Alliance Boots of $617   million for the year ended August   31, 2014. The  respective  consolidated income  statement  of Alliance Boots  was  prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, was audited by other auditors whose report has been furnished to us, and our opinion, insofar as it relates to the amounts included for the Company s equity earnings in Alliance Boots, on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, is based on the report of the other auditors. We have applied auditing procedures to the adjustments to reflect the Company s equity earnings in Alliance Boots in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and auditing procedures to take into consideration the differences in reporting periods between Alliance Boots and the Company.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the report of the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the report of the other auditors, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Walgreens Boots Alliance,   Inc. and subsidiaries as of August   31, 2016 and 2015, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended August   31, 2016, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of August   31, 2016, based on the criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated October   20 ,  2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders  
  Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (successor to Walgreen Co.) and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of August 31, 2016 based on criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management s Report on Internal Control. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of August 31,  2016 , based on the criteria established in  Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013)  issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended August 31, 2016 of the Company and our report dated October 20 ,  2016 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K. The controls evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, i ncluding its Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ). Based upon the controls evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the e nd of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management s report on internal control over financial reporting and the report of Deloitte   Touche LLP, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, related to their assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting are included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K and are incorporated in this Item 9A by reference.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In connection with the evaluation pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d) of the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) by the C ompany s management, including its CEO and CFO, no changes during the quarter ended August 31, 2016 were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls

Our management, including the CEO and CFO, do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

5.2           Value of Cash-Based Awards . Each Cash-Based Award shall specify a payment amount or payment range as determined by the Committee. The Committee may establish a performance goal or goals in its discretion. If the Committee exercises its discretion to establish performance goals, the number and/or value of such Cash-Based Award (the  Performance-Based Compensation Award ) that will be paid out to the Participant will depend on the extent to which the performance goals are met and additional Service requirements, if any, are met. 

7 

5.3           Maximum Cash-Based Awards .   The maximum aggregate amount awarded or credited under this Plan with respect to Cash-Based Awards to any one Participant in any one Plan Year may not exceed ten million dollars ($10,000,000),   determined as of the date of payout.

Such provisions shall be determined in the sole discretion of the Committee, such provisions may be included in an agreement entered into with each Participant, but need not be uniform among all Awards of Cash-Based Awards issued pursuant to the Plan, and may reflect distinctions based on the reasons for termination. 

5.6           Compliance With Section 409A.  To the extent applicable, it is intended that the Plan and all Awards hereunder comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code, and the Plan and all Award Agreements shall be interpreted and applied by the Committee in a manner consistent with this intent in order to avoid the imposition of any additional tax under Section 409A of the Code. In the event that any provision of the Plan or an Award Agreement is determined by the Committee to not comply with the applicable requirements of Section 409A of the Code, the Committee shall have the authority, pursuant to Section 14.8, to take such actions and to make such interpretations or changes to the Plan or an Award Agreement as the Committee deems necessary to comply with such requirements, provided that the Committee shall act in a manner that is intended to preserve the economic value of the Award to the Participant. In no event whatsoever shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalties that may be imposed on any Participant by Section 409A of the Code or any damages for failing to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

Article 6.

Awards Not Assignable or Transferable

Except as expressly authorized by the Committee, during a Participant s lifetime, his Awards shall be payable only to the Participant. Awards shall not be assignable or transferable other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution or, subject to the consent of the Committee, pursuant to a domestic relations order entered into by a court of competent jurisdiction; no Awards shall be subject, in whole or in part, to attachment, execution, or levy of any kind; and any purported assignment or transfer in violation of this Article 6 shall be null and void. The Committee may establish such procedures as it deems appropriate for a Participant to designate a beneficiary to whom any amounts payable in the event of, or following, the Participant s death may be provided.

Each such designation shall revoke all prior designations by the same Participant under this Plan, shall be in a form prescribed by the Committee, and will be effective only when filed by the Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant s lifetime.

The determination of the Committee as to the foregoing adjustments, if any, shall be conclusive and binding on Participants under this Plan. By accepting an Award under this Plan, a Participant agrees to any adjustment to the Award made pursuant to this Section 11.2 without further consideration or action.

General Provisions

14.1         Forfeiture Events  .            

(a) 
 
 The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant s rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include, but shall not be limited to, termination of employment for Cause, termination of the Participant s provision of services to the Company, Affiliate, or Subsidiary, violation of material Company, Affiliate, or Subsidiary policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality, or other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company, any Affiliate, or Subsidiary.

(b) 
 
 If any of the Company s financial statements are required to be restated resulting from errors, omissions, or fraud, the Committee may (in its sole discretion, but acting in good faith) direct that the Company recover all or a portion of any Award granted or paid to a Participant with respect to any fiscal year of the Company the financial results of which are negatively affected by such restatement. The amount to be recovered from the Participant shall be the amount by which the Award exceeded the amount that would have been payable to the Participant had the financial statements been initially filed as restated, or any greater or lesser amount (including, but not limited to, the entire Award) that the Committee shall determine. In no event shall the amount to be recovered by the Company be less than the amount required to be repaid or recovered as a matter of law (including but not limited to amounts that are required to be recovered or forfeited under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or Section 954 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010). The Committee shall determine whether the Company shall effect any such recovery: (i) by seeking repayment from the Participant, (ii) by reducing (subject to applicable law and the terms and conditions of the applicable plan, program or arrangement) the amount that would otherwise be payable to the Participant under any compensatory plan, program, or arrangement maintained by the Company, an Affiliate, or any Subsidiary, (iii) by withholding payment of future increases in compensation (including the payment of any discretionary bonus amount) or grants of compensatory awards that would otherwise have been made in accordance with the Company s otherwise applicable compensation practices, or (iv) by any combination of the foregoing.

12 

14.2         Gender and Number . Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine, the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the plural. 

14.3         Severability . In the event any provision of this Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this Plan, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 

14.4         Requirements of Law . The granting of and settlement of Awards under this Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. 

14.5         Employees Based Outside of the United States . Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, in order to comply with the laws in other countries in which the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries operate or have Employees and/or Directors, the Committee, in its sole discretion, shall have the power and authority to: 

(a) 
 
 Determine which Affiliates and Subsidiaries shall be covered by this Plan;

(b) 
 
 Determine which Employees outside the United States are eligible to participate in this Plan;

(c) 
 
 Modify the terms and conditions of any Award granted to Employees outside the United States to comply with applicable foreign laws;

(d) 
 
 Establish sub-plans and modify any terms and procedures, to the extent such actions may be necessary or advisable. Any subplans and modifications to Plan terms and procedures established under this Section 14.5 by the Committee shall be attached to this Plan document as appendices; and

(e) 
 
 Take any action, before or after an Award is made, that it deems advisable to obtain approval or comply with any necessary local government regulatory exemptions or approvals.

Notwithstanding the above, the Committee may not take any actions hereunder, and no Awards shall be granted, that would violate applicable law.

14.6         Unfunded Plan . Participants shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any investments that the Company, its Subsidiaries, or its Affiliates may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under this Plan. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, beneficiary, legal representative, or any other individual. To the extent that any individual acquires a right to receive payments from the Company or any Affiliate or Subsidiary under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company or the Subsidiary or Affiliate, as the case may be. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company, or the Subsidiary or Affiliate, as the case may be and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts except as expressly set forth in this Plan. 

13 

14.7         Retirement and Welfare Plans . Neither Awards made under this Plan nor cash paid pursuant to such Awards may be included as  compensation  for purposes of computing the benefits payable to any Participant under the Company s or any Subsidiary s or Affiliate s retirement plans (both qualified and nonqualified) or welfare benefit plans unless such other plan expressly provides that such compensation shall be taken into account in computing a Participant s benefit. 

14.8         Deferred Compensation . 

(a) 
 
 The Committee may grant Awards under the Plan that provide for the deferral of compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A. It is intended that such Awards comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A so that amounts deferred thereunder are not includible in income before actual payment and are not subject to an additional tax of twenty percent (20%) at the time the deferred amounts are no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.

(b) 
 
 Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan or Award Agreement to the contrary, if one or more of the payments or benefits to be received by a Participant pursuant to an Award would constitute deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A and would cause the Participant to incur any penalty tax or interest under Code Section 409A or any regulations or Treasury guidance promulgated thereunder, the Committee may reform the Plan and Award Agreement to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A and to the extent practicable maintain the original intent of the Plan and Award Agreement. By accepting an Award under this Plan, a Participant agrees to any amendments to the Award made pursuant to this Section 14.8(b) without further consideration or action.

14.9         Nonexclusivity of this Plan . The adoption of this Plan shall not be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or Committee to adopt such other compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable for any Participant. 

14.10       No Constraint on Corporate Action . Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to: (a) limit, impair, or otherwise affect the Company s or a Subsidiary s or an Affiliate s right or power to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure, or to merge or consolidate, or dissolve, liquidate, sell, or transfer all or any part of its business or assets; or (b) limit the right or power of the Company or a Subsidiary or an Affiliate to take any action which such entity deems to be necessary or appropriate. 

14.11       Payments to a Trust.  The Committee is authorized to cause to be established a trust agreement or several trust agreements or similar arrangements from which the Committee may make payments of amounts due or to become due to any Participants under the Plan. 

14 

14.12         Governing Law .  The Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Illinois, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, recipients of an Award under this Plan are deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts of Illinois to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to this Plan or any related Award Agreement. 

14.13       Delivery and Execution of Electronic Documents . To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company may: (a) deliver by email or other electronic means (including posting on a Web site maintained by the Company or by a third party under contract with the Company) all documents relating to the Plan or any Award thereunder and all other documents that the Company is required to deliver to its security holders (including without limitation, annual reports and proxy statements), and (b) permit Participants to electronically execute applicable Plan documents (including, but not limited to, Award Agreements) in a manner prescribed to the Committee. 

14.14       No Representations or Warranties Regarding Tax Effect . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, the Company, its Affiliates and Subsidiaries, the Board, and the Committee neither represent nor warrant the tax treatment under any federal, state, local, or foreign laws and regulations thereunder (individually and collectively referred to as the  Tax Laws ) of any Award granted or any amounts paid to any Participant under the Plan including, but not limited to, when and to what extent such Awards or amounts may be subject to tax, penalties, and interest under the Tax Laws. 

14.15       Indemnification . Subject to applicable requirements of Illinois law and the Delaware General Corporation Law, each individual who is or shall have been a member of the Board, or a Committee appointed by the Board, or an officer of the Company to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Article 3, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him or her in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he or she may be a party or in which he or she may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him or her in settlement thereof, with the Company s approval, or paid by him or her in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding against him or her, provided he or she shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he or she undertakes to handle and defend it on his/her own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability, or expense is a result of his/her own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such individuals may be entitled under the Company s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless.

This document (referred to below as this  Agreement ) spells out the terms and conditions of the stock option (the  Option ) granted to you by Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the  Company ), pursuant to the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. 2013 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) on and as of the Grant Date designated above.  Except as otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Agreement have the respective meanings set forth in the Plan.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Employer" means the entity (the Company or the Affiliate) that employs you on the applicable date.  The Plan, as in effect on the date of this Agreement and as it may be amended from time to time, is incorporated into this Agreement by this reference.

You and the Company agree as follows:

1.                 Grant of Option  .  Pursuant to the approval and direction of the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the  Committee ), the Company hereby grants you an Option to purchase all or any part of the number of Shares Granted set forth above of common stock of the Company, par value US$.01 ("Stock"), at the per-share exercise price, which is 100% of the fair market value of a share of Stock on the Grant Date (the "Exercise Price"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.  This stock option is intended to be a "non-qualified stock option" and shall not be treated as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. 

2.                 Vesting/Exercise/Expiration  .  The Employee may not exercise the Option prior to the Vesting Date or Dates set forth above absent action by the Committee to waive or alter such restrictions or as may be permitted under the below paragraphs.  Thereafter, except as hereinafter provided, the Employee may exercise the Option, to the extent it is vested, at any time and from time to time until the close of business on the Expiration Date set forth above.  The Option may be exercised to purchase any number of whole shares of Stock, except that no purchase shall be for less than ten (10) full shares, or the remaining unexercised shares, if less.  This Option is deemed to be "outstanding" until it has been exercised in full or expired pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

3.                 Disability  .  If, without having fully exercised this Option, you have a Termination of Service due to Disability, then any Shares Granted under the Option that are not yet vested at that time shall thereupon become vested and (a) you may exercise this Option for the full number of Shares Granted (less any shares for which this Option was previously exercised), but (b) your right to exercise this Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the Expiration Date or a date which is one (1) year following the date of your Termination of Service. 

4.                 Death  .  If, without having fully exercised this Option, you have a Termination of Service due to your death, then any Shares Granted under the Option that are not yet vested at that time shall be fully vested and (a) the Option may be exercised by the executor or administrator of your estate or by such person or persons who shall have acquired your rights hereunder by bequest or inheritance or by designation as your beneficiary for the full number of Shares Granted (less any shares for which this Option was previously exercised), but (b), such person s right to exercise this Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the Expiration Date or a date which is one (1) year after the date of your death. 

5.                 Retirement  .  If without having fully exercised this Option you have a Termination of Service by reason of Retirement, then (a) the number of Shares Granted for which you may exercise the Option shall be determined by treating each Vesting Date specified in the introduction to this Agreement as occurring one year prior to that Vesting Date, but (b) your right to exercise any portion of the Option that is vested upon your Retirement shall terminate upon the earlier of the Expiration Date or a date which is one (1) year after the date of your Retirement.  Shares Granted for which you cannot exercise the Option under this Section 5 shall be forfeited. 

6.                 Termination of Service Following a Change in Control  .  If there is a Change in Control of the Company and within the one-year period thereafter you have a Termination of Service initiated by your Employer other than for Cause (as defined in Section 8), then any Shares Granted under the Option that are not yet vested at that time shall thereupon become vested and (a) you may exercise this Option for the full number of Shares Granted (less any shares for which this Option was previously exercised), but (b) your right to exercise this Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the Expiration Date or a date which is ninety (90) days after the date of your Termination of Service, subject to the right of the Committee to extend the exercise period of this Option.  Shares Granted for which you cannot exercise the Option under this Section 6 shall be forfeited.  The foregoing is also subject to the Committee s exercise of its discretion under Section 9.01 of the Plan. For purposes of this Section 6, a Termination of Service initiated by your Employer shall include a Termination of Employment for Good Reason under - and pursuant to the terms and conditions of   the Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Executive Severance and Change in Control Plan, but only to the extent applicable to you as an eligible participant in such Plan. 

7.                 Other Termination of Service  .  If without having fully exercised this Option you have a voluntary or involuntary Termination of Service for any reason other than as set forth in Section 3, 4, 5 or 6 above, as determined by the Committee, then (a) for any Shares Granted with respect to which such Termination of Service is prior to the applicable Vesting Date, this Option shall be forfeited, and (b) for any Shares Granted with respect to which such Termination of Service is on or after the applicable Vesting Date, then your right to exercise this Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the Expiration Date or a date which is ninety (90) days after the date of your Termination of Service.  The foregoing is subject to the right of the Committee to extend the exercise period of this Option, including any extension granted by the Committee or its delegate as needed to allow your right to exercise to extend beyond a period during which you are restricted from exercising the Option due to a Company-designated trading blackout period, and is subject to earlier expiration as provided in Section 8 below. 

8.                 Forfeiture of Outstanding Options Upon Termination for Cause or Following Termination of Service  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, your remaining right, if any, to exercise the Option shall immediately terminate if you are terminated for Cause or if and when you violate any post-employment obligation that you may have to the Company, including but not limited to any non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, non-disparagement or other restrictive covenant.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  means any one or more of the following, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion: 

(a)            your commission of a felony or any crime of moral turpitude; 

(b)            your dishonesty or material violation of standards of integrity in the course of fulfilling your employment duties to the Company or any Affiliate; 

(c)            your material violation of a material written policy of the Company or any Affiliate violation of which is grounds for immediate termination; 

(d)            your willful and deliberate failure to perform your employment duties to the Company or any Affiliate in any material respect, after reasonable notice of such failure and an opportunity to correct it; or 

(e)            your failure to comply in any material respect with the United States ("U.S.") Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and the U.S. Truth in Negotiations Act, or any rules or regulations thereunder. 

9.                 Exercise Process  .  This Option may be exercised by giving notice to Fidelity, the third party administrator to administer the Option exercise process.  The exercise notice (a) shall be signed by you or (in the event of your death) your legal representative, (b) shall specify the number of full shares of Stock then elected to be purchased, and (c) shall be accompanied by payment in full of the Exercise Price of the shares to be purchased.  Payment may be made in cash or by check payable to the order of the Company, and such payment shall include any income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to your participation in the Plan that are required to be withheld ("Tax-Related Items"), as set forth in Section 10 below.  Alternatively, the Committee may allow for one or more of the following methods of exercising this Option: 

(a)            Payment for shares as to which this Option is being exercised and/or payment of any Tax-Related Items may be made by transfer to the Company of shares of Stock you already own, or any combination of such shares and cash, having a fair market value determined at the time of exercise of the Option equal to, but not exceeding, the Exercise Price and/or the tax withholding obligation, as the case may be. 

(b)            A  same day sale  transaction pursuant to which a third party (engaged by you or the Company) loans funds to you to enable you to purchase the shares of Stock and pay any Tax-Related Items, and then sells a sufficient number of the exercised shares on your behalf to enable you to repay the loan and any fees.  The remaining shares and/or cash are then delivered by the third party to you. 

(c)            A  net exercise  transaction, pursuant to which the Company delivers to you the net number of whole shares of Stock remaining from the portion of the Option being exercised after deduction of a number of shares of Stock with a fair market value equal to the Exercise Price and a number of shares of Stock with a fair market value equal to the amount of any Tax-Related Items 

As promptly as practicable after receipt of such notice of exercise and payment (including payment with respect to any Tax-Related Items), subject to Section 13 below, the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to you (or in the event of your death to your legal representative, as the case may be), certificates for the shares of Stock so purchased.  Alternatively, such shares of Stock may be issued and held in book entry form.

Notwithstanding any provision within the Agreement to the contrary, if you are resident or employed outside of the U.S., the Committee may require that you (or in the event of your death, your legal representative, as the case may be) exercise the Option in a method other than as specified above, may require you to exercise the Option only by means of a  same day sale  transaction (either a  sell-all  transaction or a  sell-to-cover  transaction) as it shall determine in its sole discretion, or may require you to sell any shares of Stock you acquire under the Plan immediately or within a specified period following your Termination of Service (in which case, you hereby agree that the Company shall have the authority to issue sale instructions in relation to such shares of Stock on your behalf).

10.               Responsibility for Taxes; Tax Withholding  . 

(a)            You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or your Employer, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or your Employer.  You further acknowledge that the Company and/or your Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of shares of Stock acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you acknowledge that the Company and/or your Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 

(b)            Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or your Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, you authorize the Company, your Employer or its agent to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:  (i) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or your Employer; (ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent); or (iii) withholding from the shares of Stock to be delivered upon exercise of the Option that number of shares of Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to (but not in excess of) the minimum amount required by law to be withheld. For purposes of the foregoing, no fractional shares of Stock will be withheld or issued pursuant to the grant of the Option and the issuance of shares of Stock hereunder. 

Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable statutory minimum withholding rates (as determined by the Company in good faith and in its sole discretion) or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the share equivalent.  If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding from the shares of Stock to be delivered upon exercise of the Option, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of shares of Stock subject to the exercised Option, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of Stock are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.

You agree to pay to the Company or your Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or your Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares of Stock or the proceeds from the sale of shares of Stock if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

11.               Limited Transferability  .  You may not sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise alienate or hypothecate this Option, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law, other than by beneficiary designation effective upon your death, by will or by the laws of intestacy.  During your lifetime, this Option and all rights granted hereunder shall be exercisable only by you.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may transfer this Option, in whole or in part, by gift to a Permitted Transferee in accordance with rules and subject to any conditions specified by the Committee under the Plan. 

12.               Rights as Stockholder  .  You shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares of Stock subject to this Option until such time as the Exercise Price has been paid and a certificate of stock for such shares has been issued to you or such shares of Stock have been recorded in your name in book entry form.  Except as provided in Section 18 below, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or distributions or other rights with respect to such shares for which the record date is prior to the date on which you become the holder of record thereof.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if a law or any regulation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or of any other body having jurisdiction shall require the Company or you to take any action before shares of Stock can be delivered to you hereunder, then the date of delivery of such shares may be delayed accordingly. 

13.               Securities Laws  .  If a Registration Statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is not in effect with respect to the shares of Stock to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement, you hereby represent that you are acquiring the shares of Stock for investment and with no present intention of selling or transferring them and that you will not sell or otherwise transfer the shares except in compliance with all applicable securities laws and requirements of any stock exchange on which the shares of Stock may then be listed. 

14.               Not a Public Offering  .  If you are resident outside the U.S., the grant of the Option is not intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (or country of employment, if different).  The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings with the local securities authorities (unless otherwise required under local law), and the grant of the Option is not subject to the supervision of the local securities authorities. 

15.               Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws  .  Your country of residence may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws that may affect your ability to acquire or sell shares of Stock under the Plan during such times you are considered to have "inside information" (as defined in the laws in your country).  These laws may be the same or different from any Company insider trading policy.  You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations, and you are advised to speak to your personal advisor on this matter. 

16.               Repatriation; Compliance with Law; Method of Exercise  .  If you are resident or employed outside the U.S., as a condition of the Option, you agree to repatriate all payments attributable to the shares of Stock and/or cash acquired under the Plan in accordance with applicable foreign exchange rules and regulations in your country of residence (and country of employment, if different).  In addition, you agree to take any and all actions, and consent to any and all actions taken by the Company and its Affiliates, as may be required to allow the Company and its Affiliates to comply with local laws, rules and/or regulations in your country of residence (and country of employment, if different).  Finally, you agree to take any and all actions as may be required to comply with your personal obligations under local laws, rules and/or regulations in your country of residence and country of employment, if different). 

17.               No Advice Regarding Grant  .  No employee of the Company is permitted to advise you regarding your participation in the Plan or your acquisition or sale of the shares of Stock underlying the Option.  Investment in shares of Stock involves a degree of risk.  Before deciding to purchase shares of Stock pursuant to the Option, you should carefully consider all risk factors relevant to the acquisition of shares of Stock under the Plan and you should carefully review all of the materials related to the Option and the Plan. You are hereby advised to consult with your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors before taking any action related to the Plan. 

18.               Change in Stock  .  In the event of any change in Stock by reason of any stock dividend, recapitalization, reorganization, split-up, merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, or of any similar change affecting Stock, the number of shares of Stock subject to this Option and the Exercise Price shall be equitably adjusted by the Committee. 

19.               Nature of the Option  .  In accepting the Option, you acknowledge, understand and agree that: 

(a)            the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and limited induration, and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time; 

(b)            the grant of the Option is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of stock options, or benefits in lieu of stock options, even if stock options have been granted in the past; 

(c)            all decisions with respect to future grants of stock options or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the form and timing of any grant, the number of shares of Stock subject to the stock options, vesting provisions, and the exercise price applicable to the stock option; 

(d)            the Option and your participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment or be interpreted as forming an employment or service contract with the Company or any Affiliate and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, your Employer or an Affiliate, as applicable, to terminate your employment or service relationship; 

(e)            you are voluntarily participating in the Plan; 

(f)             the Option and the shares of Stock subject to the Option are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; 

(g)            the Option, the shares of Stock subject to the Option and the value of same, is an extraordinary item of compensation outside the scope of your employment (and employment contract, if any) and is not part of normal or expected compensation for any purpose, including, without limitation, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments; 

(h)            the future value of the shares of Stock underlying the Option is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty;

(j)             no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Option resulting from a Termination of Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the Option to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, your Employer or any Affiliate, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, the Employer and all Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; 

(k)            unless otherwise provided herein, in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Option and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Option or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the shares of Stock of the Company; and 

(l)             neither the Company nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the U.S. dollar that may affect the value of the Option or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the Option or the subsequent sale of any shares of Stock acquired upon settlement of the Option.

This Exhibit forms a part of the Stock Option  Award Agreement covering Options awarded to an employee of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., on behalf of itself, its affiliates, subsidiaries, and successors (collectively referred to as  Employee  and the  Company ).

WHEREAS, the Company develops and/or uses valuable business, technical, proprietary, customer and patient information it protects by limiting its disclosure and by keeping it secret or confidential;

WHEREAS, Employee acknowledges that during the course of employment, he or she has or will receive, contribute, or develop such confidential information; and

WHEREAS, the Company desires to protect from its competitors such confidential information and also desires to protect its legitimate business interests and goodwill in maintaining its employee and customer relationships.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the Stock Option issued to Employee pursuant the Agreement to which this is attached as Exhibit A, Employee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement:

1.                 Confidentiality  .    At all times during and after the termination of my employment with the Company, I will not, without the Company s prior written permission, directly or indirectly for any purpose other than performance of my duties for the Company, utilize or disclose to anyone outside of the Company any Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information of the Company or any information received by the Company in confidence from or about third parties, as long as such matters remain Trade Secrets or otherwise confidential, as further defined below. 

a. 
 
  Trade Secrets  are a form of intellectual property and may include all tangible and intangible forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs or codes, and may in particular include such things as pricing information, business records, software programs, algorithms, inventions, patent applications, and designs and processes not known outside the Company.  Trade Secrets may be stored, compiled, memorialized or contained in various forms or media, such as paper, electronic media or transmission (such as disc, email, file transfers, tape, or web site features), all other forms of audio and/or video transfer, or even oral communications.

b. 
 
  Confidential Information  shall include Trade Secrets and, more broadly, any information or material which is not generally known to the public, and which (i) is generated or collected by or utilized in the operations of the Company and relates to the actual or anticipated business of the Company or the Company s actual or prospective vendors or clients; or (ii) is suggested by or results from any task assigned to me by the Company or work performed by me for or on behalf of the Company or any client of the Company.  Confidential Information shall not be considered generally known to the public if revealed improperly to the public by me or others without the Company s express written consent and/or in violation of an obligation of confidentiality to the Company.   Confidential Information may take a variety of forms including but not limited to paper, electronic, media or transmission (such as email, file transfers, tape or web site features), and all other forms of audio and/or video transfer. Examples of confidential information include, but are not limited to, customer, referral source, supplier and contractor identification and contacts, confidential information about customers, business relationships, contract terms, pricing and margins, business, marketing and customer plans and strategies, financial data, techniques, formulations, technical know-how, formulae, research, development and production information, processes, designs, architectures, prototypes, models, software,  patent applications and plans, projections, proposals, discussion guides, personal or performance information about employees, or legal advice related to the foregoing.

The restrictions set forth in this paragraph are in addition to and not in lieu of any obligations I have by law with respect to the Company s Confidential Information, including any obligations I may owe under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (the  TSA ) and any applicable state statutes.  Further, nothing herein shall prohibit me from divulging evidence of criminal wrongdoing to law enforcement or prohibit me from disclosing Confidential Information or Trade Secrets if compelled by order of court or an agency of competent jurisdiction or as required by law; however, I shall promptly inform the Company of any such situations and shall take reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets until the Company has been informed of such required disclosure and has had a reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order. Pursuant to the TSA, I understand that   an individual may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Additionally ,  I understand that   an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to his or her attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, so long as any document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and the individual does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.   Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with the TSA or create liability for disclosures of Trade Secrets that are expressly allowed by TSA.

2.                Non-Competition  .    I agree that during my employment with the Company and for one year after the termination of my employment, I will not, directly or indirectly, invest in, own, operate, finance, control, or provide Competing Services to any Competing Business Line, in both cases as defined below.  I understand that the restrictions in this paragraph apply no matter whether my employment is terminated by me or the Company and no matter whether that termination is voluntary or involuntary.  The above restrictions shall not apply to passive investments of less than 5% ownership interest in any entity. I understand that the term  Competing Business Line  used in this Agreement means any business that is in competition with any business engaged in by the Company with respect to which I provide substantial services during the last two years of my employment with the Company.

I understand that I will be deemed to be providing  Competing Services  if the nature of such services are sufficiently similar in position, scope and geographic area to any position held by me during the last two years of my employment with the Company.

3.                 Non-Solicitation  .    I agree that during my employment with the Company and for two years after the termination of my employment from the Company for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary: 

(a) 
 
 I will not directly or indirectly, solicit any Restricted Customer for purposes of providing Competing Products or Services, or offer, provide or sell Competing Products or Services to any Restricted Customer.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Competing Products or Services  means products or services that are competitive with products or services offered by, developed by, designed by or distributed by the Company to any Restricted Customer, and  Restricted Customer  means any person, company or entity which was a customer, potential customer, vendor, supplier or referral source of the Company and with which I had direct contact or about which I learned confidential information at any time during the last two years of my employment with the Company; and

(b) 
 
 I will not, nor will I assist any third party to, directly or indirectly (i) raid, hire, solicit, or attempt to persuade any employee of the Company with whom I currently work or with whom I worked at any point during the last two years preceding the termination of my employment with the Company,  and who possesses or had access to confidential information of the Company, to leave the employ of the Company; (ii) interfere with the performance by any such employee of his/her duties for the Company; or (iii) communicate with any such employee for the purposes described in items (i) and (ii) in this paragraph.

4.                 Non-Inducement  .  I will not directly or indirectly assist or encourage any person or entity in carrying out or conducting any activity that would be prohibited by this Agreement if such activity were carried out or conducted by me. 

5.                 Non-Disparagement  .    I agree (whether or not I am then an Employee) not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company, its Affiliates, or any of their officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, agents or products other than in the good faith performance of my duties to the Company and its Affiliates while I am employed by the Company and its Affiliates and thereafter.  The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements in response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings).

d. 
 
   Prior Inventions  .  Employee has disclosed to the Company any continuing obligations to any third party with respect to Intellectual Property.

(j) 
 
 If I violate this Agreement, then the restrictions set out in Paragraphs 2 - 6 shall be extended by the same period of time as the period of time during which the violation(s) occurred.

I acknowledge that my relationship with the Company is  terminable at will  by either party and that the Company or I can terminate the relationship with or without cause and without following any specific procedures.

SPAIN

1.                 Acknowledgement of Discretionary Nature of the Plan; No Vested Rights  . This provision supplements the terms of the Agreement: 

In accepting the Award, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan.

You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and in its sole discretion granted the Option under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company or its Affiliates throughout the world.  The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any of its Affiliates on an ongoing basis.  Consequently, you understand that the Option is granted on the assumption and condition that the Option and the shares of Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option shall not become a part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any of its Affiliates) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever.  In addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for the assumptions and conditions referenced above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, the Option shall be null and void.

Further, you understand and agree that the vesting of the Option is expressly conditioned on your continued and active rendering of service, such that upon a Termination of Service, the Option may cease vesting immediately, in whole or in part, effective on the date of your Termination of Service (unless otherwise specifically provided in Section 3, 4, 5 or 6 of the Agreement). This will be the case, for example, even if (a) you are considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause; (b) you are dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (c) you terminate service due to a change of work location, duties or any other employment or contractual condition, (d) you terminate service due to a unilateral breach of contract by the Company or an Affiliate.  Consequently, upon a Termination of Service for any of the above reasons, you may automatically lose any rights to the Option that were not vested on the date of your Termination of Service, as described in the Plan and Agreement.  In addition, you understand and agree that the post-Termination of Service exercise period specified in the Agreement shall run from the date of your Termination of Service, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion.

You acknowledge that you have read and specifically accept the conditions referred to in the Agreement regarding the impact of a Termination of Service on your Option.

2.                 Termination for Cause  .   Cause  shall be defined as indicated in Section 8 of the Agreement, irrespective of whether the termination is or is not considered a fair termination (i.e.,  despido procedente ) under Spanish legislation. 

UNITED KINGDOM

1.                 Responsibility for Taxes; Tax Withholding  .  The following provision supplements Section 10 of the Agreement: 

If payment or withholding of the income tax due in connection with the Option is not made within ninety (90) days after the end of the U.K. tax year in which the event giving rise to the income tax liability occurred or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the  Due Date ), the amount of any uncollected income tax shall constitute a loan owed by you to your Employer, effective as of the Due Date.  You agree that the loan will bear interest at the then-current official rate of Her Majesty s Revenue   Customs ( HMRC ), it shall be immediately due and repayable, and the Company or Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 10 of the Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), will not be eligible for a loan to cover the income tax liability.  In the event that you are a director or executive officer and the income tax is not collected from or paid by you by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions ( NICs ) will be payable.  You will be responsible for paying and reporting any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime, and for reimbursing the Company or your Employer (as applicable) the value of any employee NICs due on this additional benefit.

2.                 Exclusion of Claim  .  You acknowledge and agree that you will have no entitlement to compensation or damages insofar as such entitlement arises or may arise from your ceasing to have rights under or to be entitled to the Option, whether or not as a result of your Termination of Service (whether such termination is in breach of contract or otherwise), or from the loss or diminution in value of the Option.  Upon the grant of the Option, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have waived any such entitlement.

You and the Company agree as follows:

1.                   Grant of Option  .  Pursuant to the approval and direction of the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors (the  Committee ), the Company hereby grants you an Option to purchase all or any part of the number of Shares Granted set forth above of common stock of the Company, par value US$.01 ("Stock"), at the per-share exercise price, which is 100% of the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the Grant Date (the "Exercise Price"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.  This stock option shall not be treated as an incentive stock option within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code. 

2.                   Vesting/Exercise/Expiration  .  The Employee may not exercise the Option prior to the Vesting Date or Dates set forth above absent action by the Committee to waive or alter such restrictions as may be permitted by the Plan or as may be permitted under the below paragraphs.  Thereafter, except as hereinafter provided, the Employee may exercise the Option, to the extent it is vested, at any time and from time to time until the close of business on the Expiration Date set forth above.  The Option may be exercised to purchase any number of whole shares of Stock, except that no purchase shall be for less than ten (10) full shares, or the remaining unexercised shares, if less.  This Option is deemed to be "outstanding" until it has been exercised in full or expired pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

3.                   Disability  .  If, without having fully exercised this Option, you have a Termination of Service due to disability or injury (as evidenced to the satisfaction of the Committee or its delegate), then any Shares Granted under the Option that are not yet vested at that time shall thereupon become vested and (a) you may exercise this Option for the full number of Shares Granted (less any shares for which this Option was previously exercised), but (b) your right to exercise this Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the Expiration Date or a date which is one (1) year following the date of your Termination of Service. 

4.                   Death  .  If you die without having fully exercised this Option, then any Shares Granted under the Option that are not yet vested (but which have not lapsed or been forfeited) at that time shall be fully vested and (a) the Option may be exercised, subject to the UK Sub-Plan, by your personal representative(s) for the full number of Shares Granted (less any shares for which this Option was previously exercised), but (b), such person s right to exercise this Option shall terminate not later than one (1) year after the date of your death. 

5.                   Retirement  .  If without having fully exercised this Option you have a Termination of Service by reason of retirement, then (a) the number of Shares Granted for which you may exercise the Option shall be determined by treating each Vesting Date specified in the introduction to this Agreement as occurring one year prior to that Vesting Date, but (b) your right to exercise any portion of the Option that is vested upon your retirement shall terminate upon the earlier of the Expiration Date or a date which is one (1) year after the date of your retirement.  Shares Granted for which you cannot exercise the Option under this Section 5 shall be forfeited. 

6.                   Termination of Service Following a Change in Control  .  If there is a Change in Control of the Company and within the one-year period thereafter you have a Termination of Service initiated by your Employer other than for Cause (as defined in Section 8), then any Shares Granted under the Option that are not yet vested at that time shall thereupon become vested and (a) you may exercise this Option for the full number of Shares Granted (less any shares for which this Option was previously exercised), but (b) your right to exercise this Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the Expiration Date or a date which is ninety (90) days after the date of your Termination of Service.  Shares Granted for which you cannot exercise the Option under this Section 6 shall be forfeited.  The foregoing is also subject to the Committee s exercise of its discretion under Section 9.01 of the Plan.

7.                   Other Termination of Service  .  If without having fully exercised this Option you have a voluntary or involuntary Termination of Service for any reason other than as set forth in Section 3, 4, 5 or 6 above, as determined by the Committee (including, without limitation, by reason of redundancy (within the meaning of the Employment Rights Act 1996 or the Employment Rights (Northern Ireland) Order 1996),  a relevant transfer within the meaning of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 or the company with which you hold office or employment ceasing to be controlled by the Company), then (a) for any Shares Granted with respect to which such Termination of Service is prior to the applicable Vesting Date, this Option shall be forfeited, and (b) for any Shares Granted with respect to which such Termination of Service is on or after the applicable Vesting Date, then your right to exercise this Option shall terminate upon the earlier of the Expiration Date or a date which is ninety (90) days after the date of your Termination of Service. 

8.                   Forfeiture of Outstanding Options Upon Termination for Cause or Following Termination of Service  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, your remaining right, if any, to exercise the Option shall immediately terminate if you are terminated for Cause or if and when you violate any post-employment obligation that you may have to the Company, including but not limited to any non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, non-disparagement or other restrictive covenant.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Cause  means any one or more of the following, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion: 

(a)                your commission of a felony or any crime of moral turpitude; 

(b)                your dishonesty or material violation of standards of integrity in the course of fulfilling your employment duties to the Company or any Affiliate; 

(c)                your material violation of a material written policy of the Company or any Affiliate violation of which is grounds for immediate termination; 

(d)                your willful and deliberate failure to perform your employment duties to the Company or any Affiliate in any material respect, after reasonable notice of such failure and an opportunity to correct it; or 

(e)                your failure to comply in any material respect with the United States ("U.S.") Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the U.S. Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the U.S. Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, and the U.S. Truth in Negotiations Act, or any rules or regulations thereunder. 

9.                   Exercise Process  .  This Option may be exercised by giving notice to Fidelity, the third party administrator to administer the Option exercise process.  The exercise notice (a) shall be signed by you or (in the event of your death) your personal representative(s), (b) shall specify the number of full shares of Stock then elected to be purchased, and (c) shall be accompanied by payment in full of the Exercise Price of the shares to be purchased.  Payment may be made in cash or by check payable to the order of the Company, and such payment shall include any income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax-related items related to the Option that are required to be withheld ("Tax-Related Items"), as set forth in Section 10 below.  Alternatively, the Committee may allow for a  same day sale  transaction pursuant to which a third party (engaged by you or the Company) loans funds to you to enable you to purchase the shares of Stock and pay any Tax-Related Items, and then sells a sufficient number of the exercised shares on your behalf to enable you to repay the loan and any fees.  The remaining shares are then delivered by the third party to you. 

As promptly as practicable after receipt of such notice of exercise and payment (including payment with respect to any Tax-Related Items), subject to Section 13 below, the Company shall in accordance with the UK Sub-Plan cause to be issued and delivered to you (or in the event of your death to your personal representative(s), as the case may be), certificates for the shares of Stock so purchased.  Alternatively, such shares of Stock may be issued and held in book entry form.

10.                  Responsibility for Taxes; Tax Withholding  . 

(a)               You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or your Employer, the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or your Employer.  You further acknowledge that the Company and/or your Employer (1) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of shares of Stock acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (2) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.  Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you acknowledge that the Company and/or your Employer (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction. 

(b)              Prior to any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or your Employer to satisfy all Tax-Related Items.  In this regard, if your notice to exercise your Option is not accompanied by a sufficient amount to cover the Tax-Related Items arising on exercise and you do not otherwise provide the Company or your Employer with a sufficient amount to cover the Tax-Related Items before they arise, you authorize the Company, your Employer or its agent to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:  (i) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or your Employer; or (ii) withholding from proceeds of the sale of sufficient Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization without further consent). For purposes of the foregoing, no fractional shares of Stock will be issued pursuant to the grant of the Option and the issuance of shares of Stock hereunder. 

Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable statutory minimum withholding rates (as determined by the Company in good faith and in its sole discretion) or other applicable withholding rates.

You agree to pay to the Company or your Employer any amount of Tax-Related Items that the Company or your Employer may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described.  The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the shares of Stock or the proceeds from the sale of shares of Stock if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

11.                 Limited Transferability  .  You may not sell, transfer, pledge, assign or otherwise alienate, dispose of, encumber or hypothecate this Option, whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law.  During your lifetime, this Option and all rights granted hereunder shall be exercisable only by you.  After your death, this Option may only be exercised by your personal representative(s) in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement. 

12.                Rights as Stockholder  .  You shall have no rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares of Stock subject to this Option until such time as the Exercise Price has been paid and a certificate of stock for such shares has been issued to you or such shares of Stock have been recorded in your name in book entry form.  Except as provided in Section 18 below, no adjustment shall be made for dividends or distributions or other rights with respect to such shares for which the record date is prior to the date on which you become the holder of record thereof.  Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, if a law or any regulation of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission or of any other regulatory body having jurisdiction shall require the Company or you to take any action before shares of Stock can be delivered to you hereunder, then the date of delivery of such shares may be delayed accordingly. 

13.                Securities Laws  .  If a Registration Statement under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended, is not in effect with respect to the shares of Stock to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement, you hereby represent that you are acquiring the shares of Stock for investment and with no present intention of selling or transferring them and that you will not sell or otherwise transfer the shares except in compliance with all applicable securities laws and requirements of any stock exchange on which the shares of Stock may then be listed. 

14.                Not a Public Offering  .  If you are resident outside the U.S., the grant of the Option is not intended to be a public offering of securities in your country of residence (or country of employment, if different).  The Company has not submitted any registration statement, prospectus or other filings with the local securities authorities (unless otherwise required under local law), and the grant of the Option is not subject to the supervision of the local securities authorities. 

15.                Insider Trading/Market Abuse Laws  .  Your country of residence may have insider trading and/or market abuse laws that may affect your ability to acquire or sell shares of Stock under the Plan during such times you are considered to have "inside information" (as defined in the laws in your country).  These laws may be the same or different from any Company insider trading policy.  You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to be informed of and compliant with such regulations, and you are advised to speak to your personal advisor on this matter. 

16.                Repatriation; Compliance with Law; Method of Exercise  .  If you are resident or employed outside the U.S., as a condition of the Option, you agree to repatriate all payments attributable to the shares of Stock acquired under the Plan in accordance with applicable foreign exchange rules and regulations in your country of residence (and country of employment, if different).  In addition, you agree to take any and all actions, and consent to any and all actions taken by the Company and its Affiliates, as may be required to allow the Company and its Affiliates to comply with local laws, rules and/or regulations in your country of residence (and country of employment, if different).  Finally, you agree to take any and all actions as may be required to comply with your personal obligations under local laws, rules and/or regulations in your country of residence and country of employment, if different). 

17.                No Advice Regarding Grant  .  No employee of the Company is permitted to advise you regarding your participation in the Plan or your acquisition or sale of the shares of Stock underlying the Option.  Investment in shares of Stock involves a degree of risk.  Before deciding to purchase shares of Stock pursuant to the Option, you should carefully consider all risk factors relevant to the acquisition of shares of Stock under the Plan and you should carefully review all of the materials related to the Option and the Plan. You are hereby advised to consult with your own personal tax, legal and financial advisors before taking any action related to the Plan. 

18.                Change in Stock  .  This Option may be adjusted by the Committee in accordance with Rule 4.2 of the UK Sub-Plan. 

19.                Nature of the Option  .  In accepting the Option, you acknowledge, understand and agree that: 

(a)                the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature and limited induration, and it may be modified, amended, suspended or terminated by the Company, in its sole discretion, at any time; 

(b)                the grant of the Option is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of stock options, or benefits in lieu of stock options, even if stock options have been granted in the past; 

(c)                all decisions with respect to future grants of stock options or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company, including, but not limited to, the form and timing of any grant, the number of shares of Stock subject to the stock options, vesting provisions, and the exercise price applicable to the stock option; 

(d)              the Option and your participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment or be interpreted as forming an employment or service contract with the Company or any Affiliate and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, your Employer or an Affiliate, as applicable, to terminate your employment or service relationship; 

(e)                you are voluntarily participating in the Plan; 

(f)                the Option and the shares of Stock subject to the Option are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; 

(g)                the Option, the shares of Stock subject to the Option and the value of same, is an extraordinary item of compensation outside the scope of your employment (and employment contract, if any) and is not part of normal or expected compensation for any purpose, including, without limitation, calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments; 

(h)                the future value of the shares of Stock underlying the Option is unknown, indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty; 

(i)                 unless otherwise determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, a Termination of Service shall be effective from the date on which active employment or service ends and shall not be extended by any statutory or common law notice of termination period; 

(j)                 no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Option resulting from a Termination of Service (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the Option to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, your Employer or any Affiliate, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, the Employer and all Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; 

(k)                you do not have any entitlement to have the Option cashed out and, unless otherwise provided herein, in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion in accordance with the Plan, the Option and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Option or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the shares of Stock of the Company; and 

(l)                neither the Company nor any Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the U.S. dollar that may affect the value of the Option or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the settlement of the Option or the subsequent sale of any shares of Stock acquired upon settlement of the Option. 

20.                 Committee Authority; Recoupment  .  It is expressly understood that the Committee is authorized to administer, construe, and make all determinations necessary or appropriate for the administration of the Plan and this Agreement, including the enforcement of any recoupment policy which applies in respect of this Option and any shares you acquire pursuant to this Option, all of which shall be binding upon you and any claimant.

WALGREENS BOOTS ALLIANCE, INC. NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT

This Exhibit forms a part of the Stock Option  Award Agreement covering Options awarded to an employee of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc., on behalf of itself, its affiliates, subsidiaries, and successors (collectively referred to as  Employee  and the  Company ).

WHEREAS, the Company develops and/or uses valuable business, technical, proprietary, customer and patient information it protects by limiting its disclosure and by keeping it secret or confidential;

WHEREAS, Employee acknowledges that during the course of employment, he or she has or will receive, contribute, or develop such confidential information; and

WHEREAS, the Company desires to protect from its competitors such confidential information and also desires to protect its legitimate business interests and goodwill in maintaining its employee and customer relationships.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the Stock Option issued to Employee pursuant the Agreement to which this is attached as Exhibit A, Employee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement:

1.                   Confidentiality  .    At all times during and after the termination of my employment with the Company, I will not, without the Company s prior written permission, directly or indirectly for any purpose other than performance of my duties for the Company, utilize or disclose to anyone outside of the Company any Trade Secrets or other Confidential Information of the Company or any information received by the Company in confidence from or about third parties, as long as such matters remain Trade Secrets or otherwise confidential, as further defined below. 

a. 
 
  Trade Secrets  are a form of intellectual property and may include all tangible and intangible forms and types of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic, or engineering information, including patterns, plans, compilations, program devices, formulas, designs, prototypes, methods, techniques, processes, procedures, programs or codes, and may in particular include such things as pricing information, business records, software programs, algorithms, inventions, patent applications, and designs and processes not known outside the Company.  Trade Secrets may be stored, compiled, memorialized or contained in various forms or media, such as paper, electronic media or transmission (such as disc, email, file transfers, tape, or web site features), all other forms of audio and/or video transfer, or even oral communications.

b. 
 
  Confidential Information  shall include Trade Secrets and, more broadly, any information or material which is not generally known to the public, and which (i) is generated or collected by or utilized in the operations of the Company and relates to the actual or anticipated business of the Company or the Company s actual or prospective vendors or clients; or (ii) is suggested by or results from any task assigned to me by the Company or work performed by me for or on behalf of the Company or any client of the Company.  Confidential Information shall not be considered generally known to the public if revealed improperly to the public by me or others without the Company s express written consent and/or in violation of an obligation of confidentiality to the Company.   Confidential Information may take a variety of forms including but not limited to paper, electronic, media or transmission (such as email, file transfers, tape or web site features), and all other forms of audio and/or video transfer. Examples of confidential information include, but are not limited to, customer, referral source, supplier and contractor identification and contacts, confidential information about customers, business relationships, contract terms, pricing and margins, business, marketing and customer plans and strategies, financial data, techniques, formulations, technical know-how, formulae, research, development and production information, processes, designs, architectures, prototypes, models, software,  patent applications and plans, projections, proposals, discussion guides, personal or performance information about employees, or legal advice related to the foregoing.

The restrictions set forth in this paragraph are in addition to and not in lieu of any obligations I have by law with respect to the Company s Confidential Information, including any obligations I may owe under the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (the  TSA ) and any applicable state statutes.  Further, nothing herein shall prohibit me from divulging evidence of criminal wrongdoing to law enforcement or prohibit me from disclosing Confidential Information or Trade Secrets if compelled by order of court or an agency of competent jurisdiction or as required by law; however, I shall promptly inform the Company of any such situations and shall take reasonable steps to prevent disclosure of Confidential Information or Trade Secrets until the Company has been informed of such required disclosure and has had a reasonable opportunity to seek a protective order. Pursuant to the TSA, I understand that   an individual may not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that: (A) is made (i) in confidence to a federal, state or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, and (ii) solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (B) is made in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal. Additionally ,  I understand that   an individual who files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose the trade secret to his or her attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, so long as any document containing the trade secret is filed under seal and the individual does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.   Nothing in this Agreement is intended to conflict with the TSA or create liability for disclosures of Trade Secrets that are expressly allowed by TSA.

2.                Non-Competition  .    I agree that during my employment with the Company and for one year after the termination of my employment, I will not, directly or indirectly, invest in, own, operate, finance, control, or provide Competing Services to any Competing Business Line, in both cases as defined below.  I understand that the restrictions in this paragraph apply no matter whether my employment is terminated by me or the Company and no matter whether that termination is voluntary or involuntary.  The above restrictions shall not apply to passive investments of less than 5% ownership interest in any entity. I understand that the term  Competing Business Line  used in this Agreement means any business that is in competition with any business engaged in by the Company with respect to which I provide substantial services during the last two years of my employment with the Company.

I understand that I will be deemed to be providing  Competing Services  if the nature of such services are sufficiently similar in position, scope and geographic area to any position held by me during the last two years of my employment with the Company.

3.                  Non-Solicitation  .    I agree that during my employment with the Company and for two years after the termination of my employment from the Company for any reason, whether voluntary or involuntary: 

(a) 
 
 I will not directly or indirectly, solicit any Restricted Customer for purposes of providing Competing Products or Services, or offer, provide or sell Competing Products or Services to any Restricted Customer.  For purposes of this Agreement,  Competing Products or Services  means products or services that are competitive with products or services offered by, developed by, designed by or distributed by the Company to any Restricted Customer, and  Restricted Customer  means any person, company or entity which was a customer, potential customer, vendor, supplier or referral source of the Company and with which I had direct contact or about which I learned confidential information at any time during the last two years of my employment with the Company; and

(b) 
 
 I will not, nor will I assist any third party to, directly or indirectly (i) raid, hire, solicit, or attempt to persuade any employee of the Company with whom I currently work or with whom I worked at any point during the last two years preceding the termination of my employment with the Company,  and who possesses or had access to confidential information of the Company, to leave the employ of the Company; (ii) interfere with the performance by any such employee of his/her duties for the Company; or (iii) communicate with any such employee for the purposes described in items (i) and (ii) in this paragraph.

4.                  Non-Inducement  .  I will not directly or indirectly assist or encourage any person or entity in carrying out or conducting any activity that would be prohibited by this Agreement if such activity were carried out or conducted by me. 

5.                  Non-Disparagement  .    I agree (whether or not I am then an Employee) not to make negative comments or otherwise disparage the Company, its Affiliates, or any of their officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, agents or products other than in the good faith performance of my duties to the Company and its Affiliates while I am employed by the Company and its Affiliates and thereafter.  The foregoing shall not be violated by truthful statements in response to legal process, required governmental testimony or filings, or administrative or arbitral proceedings (including, without limitation, depositions in connection with such proceedings).

d. 
 
   Prior Inventions  .  Employee has disclosed to the Company any continuing obligations to any third party with respect to Intellectual Property.

(j) 
 
 If I violate this Agreement, then the restrictions set out in Paragraphs 2 - 6 shall be extended by the same period of time as the period of time during which the violation(s) occurred.

(k)

I acknowledge that my relationship with the Company is  terminable at will  by either party and that the Company or I can terminate the relationship with or without cause and without following any specific procedures.

SPAIN

1.                   Acknowledgement of Discretionary Nature of the Plan; No Vested Rights  . This provision supplements the terms of the Agreement: 

In accepting the Award, you acknowledge that you consent to participation in the Plan and have received a copy of the Plan.

You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and in its sole discretion granted the Option under the Plan to individuals who may be employees of the Company or its Affiliates throughout the world.  The decision is a limited decision that is entered into upon the express assumption and condition that any grant will not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any of its Affiliates on an ongoing basis.  Consequently, you understand that the Option is granted on the assumption and condition that the Option and the shares of Stock acquired upon exercise of the Option shall not become a part of any employment contract (either with the Company or any of its Affiliates) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purposes (including severance compensation) or any other right whatsoever.  In addition, you understand that this grant would not be made to you but for the assumptions and conditions referenced above; thus, you acknowledge and freely accept that should any or all of the assumptions be mistaken or should any of the conditions not be met for any reason, the Option shall be null and void.

Further, you understand and agree that the vesting of the Option is expressly conditioned on your continued and active rendering of service, such that upon a Termination of Service, the Option may cease vesting immediately, in whole or in part, effective on the date of your Termination of Service (unless otherwise specifically provided in Section 3, 4, 5 or 6 of the Agreement). This will be the case, for example, even if (a) you are considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause; (b) you are dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (c) you terminate service due to a change of work location, duties or any other employment or contractual condition, (d) you terminate service due to a unilateral breach of contract by the Company or an Affiliate.  Consequently, upon a Termination of Service for any of the above reasons, you may automatically lose any rights to the Option that were not vested on the date of your Termination of Service, as described in the Plan and Agreement.  In addition, you understand and agree that the post-Termination of Service exercise period specified in the Agreement shall run from the date of your Termination of Service, as determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion.

You acknowledge that you have read and specifically accept the conditions referred to in the Agreement regarding the impact of a Termination of Service on your Option.

2.                   Termination for Cause  .   Cause  shall be defined as indicated in Section 8 of the Agreement, irrespective of whether the termination is or is not considered a fair termination (i.e.,  despido procedente ) under Spanish legislation. 

UNITED KINGDOM

1.                   Responsibility for Taxes; Tax Withholding  .  The following provision supplements Section 10 of the Agreement: 

If payment or withholding of any income tax due in connection with the Option is not made within ninety (90) days after the end of the U.K. tax year in which the event giving rise to the income tax liability occurred or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the  Due Date ), the amount of any such uncollected income tax shall constitute a loan owed by you to your Employer, effective as of the Due Date.  You agree that the loan will bear interest at the then-current official rate of Her Majesty s Revenue   Customs ( HMRC ), it shall be immediately due and repayable, and the Company or Employer may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in Section 10 of the Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), will not be eligible for a loan to cover the income tax liability.  In the event that you are a director or executive officer and the income tax is not collected from or paid by you by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected income tax may constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and national insurance contributions ( NICs ) may be payable.  You will be responsible for paying and reporting any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime, and for reimbursing the Company or your Employer (as applicable) the value of any employee NICs due on this additional benefit, which the Company and/or the Employer may recover from you by any of the means set forth in Section 10 of the Agreement.

2.                  Exclusion of Claim  .
