  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

  (Unaudited) 
  Note   1     Basis of Presentation 
  The condensed consolidated interim financial statements included in this report have been prepared by management of The Boeing Company (herein referred to as  Boeing , the  Company ,  we ,  us , or  our ). In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation are reflected in the interim financial statements. The results of operations for the period ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation. 
  Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented 
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016 - 02,   Leases     (Topic 842)  . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. The standard will require lessees to report most leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while lessor accounting will remain substantially unchanged. The standard requires a modified retrospective transition approach for existing leases, whereby the new rules will be applied to the earliest year presented. We do not expect the new lease standard to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The new standard was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption was not permitted. On August 12, 2015, the FASB approved a one year delay of the effective date to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, while permitting companies to voluntarily adopt the new standard as of the original effective date. The comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. The guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. The Company plans to adopt the new standard effective January 1, 2018 and is continuing to evaluate the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used. 
  Standards Issued and Implemented 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The standard requires excess tax benefits or deficiencies for share-based payments to be recorded in the period shares vest or settle as income tax expense or benefit, rather than within Additional paid-in capital. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will be included in Net cash provided by operating activities and will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity. The standard also allows us to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes and provides an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. We have elected to continue to estimate forfeitures and are not planning to change tax withholdings.  
  The Company prospectively adopted the standard during the three months ended June 30, 2016 effective January 1, 2016. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , this resulted in an increase of   $64   to Net earnings and   $0.10   to diluted earnings per share and for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $10   to Net earnings and   $0.02   to diluted earnings per share. Adoption also resulted in a   $64

     Table of Contents  

increase in Net cash provided by operating activities and a corresponding   $64   reduction in Net cash used by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Use of Estimates 
  Management makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by   Defense, Space   Security   (  BDS  ). Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. Changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contract s percent complete. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years' earnings, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by   $656   and   $384   and diluted earnings per share by   $0.95   and   $0.38  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments to prior years' earnings, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by   $69   and diluted earnings per share by   $0.11  . For the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by   $210   and diluted earnings per share by   $0.21  .  
   
  Note   2     Earnings Per Share 
  Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. The undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. Participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings. 
  Basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. 
  Diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.

The elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows: 

(1)   
    Diluted earnings per share includes any dilutive impact of stock options, restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units and performance awards. 
     The following table includes the number of shares that may be dilutive potential common shares in the future. These shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect was either antidilutive or the performance condition was not met. 

Note   3     Income Taxes  
  Our effective income tax rates were   5.8%   and   (3.4)%   for the   nine and three months ended September 30, 2016   and   31.5%   for the same periods in the prior year. The 2016 effective tax rates are lower than the prior year due to   $440   of additional tax benefits recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to the application of a 2012 Federal Court of Claims decision that allowed the tax basis in certain assets to be increased. Also, in the third quarter of 2016 a tax benefit of   $177   was recorded as a result of the settlement of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit. Additionally, the 2016 effective tax rates include the favorable impact of the permanent reinstatement of the U.S. research and development tax credit at the end of 2015.  
  The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits decreased from   $1,617   as of December 31, 2015 to   $1,378   as of September 30, 2016 primarily due to the tax basis adjustment and settlement of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit, as discussed above.

Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2013. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will begin the 2013-2014 federal tax audit in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are also subject to examination in major state and international jurisdictions for the 2001-2015 tax years. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding tax issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. 
   
  Note   4     Inventories 
  Inventories consisted of the following: 

Long-Term Contracts in Progress 
  Long-term contracts in progress includes Delta launch program inventory that is being sold at cost to   United Launch Alliance   (  ULA  ) under an inventory supply agreement that terminates on March 31, 2021. The inventory balance was   $120   (net of advances of   $253   and   $310  ) at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . See indemnifications to ULA in Note   9  . 
  Included in inventories are capitalized precontract costs of   $650   and   $732   primarily related to KC-46A Tanker and C-17 at   September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  .  
  Commercial Aircraft Programs 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 787 program:   $33,423   and   $34,656   of work in process (including deferred production costs of   $27,523   and   $28,510  ),   $2,345   and   $2,551   of supplier advances, and   $3,691   and   $3,890   of unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $22,521   of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and   $8,693   is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders.  
  We produced the fourth and fifth flight test aircraft for the 787 program in 2009 but were unable to sell them at acceptable prices. The aircraft had been used extensively for flight and ground testing and we intended to begin to refurbish the aircraft in early 2017 for commercial sale based on sales activity and market interest. However, during the second quarter of 2016 we determined that firm orders for these aircraft prior to refurbishment were now unlikely, and that the Company would not invest company funds for their refurbishment. The Company also determined the costs to refurbish the aircraft at a future date would be prohibitively expensive. We therefore determined that the aircraft are not commercially saleable, and   a  ccordingly, costs of   $1,235   associated with these aircraft were reclassified from 787 program inventory to research and development expense. The reclassification also impacted 787 deferred production costs, reducing the balance by   $1,011   at June 30, 2016.

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 747 program:   $0   and   $942   of deferred production costs, net of reach-forward losses, and   $298   and   $377   of unamortized tooling costs. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $99   of unamortized tooling costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders and   $199   is expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , work in process inventory included a number of completed 747 aircraft that we expect to recover from future orders.  
  Commercial aircraft programs inventory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling   $3,257   and   $3,166   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Used aircraft in inventories at Commercial Airplanes totaled   $224   and   $267   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Note   5     Customer Financing 
  Customer financing primarily relates to the   Boeing Capital   (  BCC  ) segment and consisted of the following: 

We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of   $61   and   $86  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $46   and   $0   was determined to be impaired. We recorded no allowance for losses on these impaired receivables as the collateral values exceeded the carrying values of the receivables. 
  The adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. We assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. Our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. 
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  

Our financing receivable balances by internal credit rating category are shown below:    

At   September 30, 2016  , our allowance related to receivables with ratings of B, BB and BBB. We applied default rates that averaged   13%  ,   9%   and   1%  , respectively, to the exposure associated with those receivables. 
  Customer Financing Exposure  
  Customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. The value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. Declines in collateral values could result in asset impairments, reduced finance lease income, and an increase in the allowance for losses. Our customer financing collateral is concentrated in 747-8 and out-of-production aircraft. Generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft.  
  The majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models:

Note   6     Investments 
  Our investments, which are recorded in Short-term and other investments or Investments, consisted of the following: 

(1)   
    Reflects amounts pledged in lieu of letters of credit as collateral in support of our workers  compensation programs. These funds can become available within 30 days notice upon issuance of letters of credit. 
                (3)   
    Restricted to pay certain claims related to workers' compensation and life insurance premiums for certain employees. 
      
  Note   7     Other Assets 
  Sea Launch 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Other assets included   $356   of receivables related to our former investment in the Sea Launch venture which became payable by certain Sea Launch partners following Sea Launch s bankruptcy filing in June 2009. The   $356   includes   $147   related to a payment made by us under a bank guarantee on behalf of Sea Launch and   $209   related to loans (partner loans) we made to Sea Launch. The net amounts owed to Boeing by each of the partners are as follows: S.P. Koroley Rocket and Space Corporation Energia of Russia     $223  , PO Yuzhnoye Mashinostroitelny Zavod of Ukraine     $89   and KB Yuzhnoye of Ukraine     $44  . 
  Although each partner is contractually obligated to reimburse us for its share of the bank guarantee, the Russian and Ukrainian partners have raised defenses to enforcement and contested our claims. On February 1, 2013, we filed an action in the United States District Court for the Central District of California seeking reimbursement from the other Sea Launch partners of the   $147   bank guarantee payment and the   $209   partner loan obligations. On May 12, 2016, the court issued a judgment in favor of Boeing relating to the bank guarantee payment and the partner loan obligations. Prior to these proceedings, we had filed a Notice of Arbitration with the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce seeking reimbursement from the other partners for a portion of these amounts. On May 16, 2016, the appellate court in Sweden dismissed the Swedish proceedings at our request. 
  We continue to pursue collection efforts in connection with the court judgment and continue to believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. In the event we are unable to secure reimbursement of   $147   related to our payment under the bank guarantee and   $209   related to partner loans made to Sea Launch, we could incur additional charges. Our current assessment as to the collectability of these receivables takes into account the current economic conditions in Russia and Ukraine, although we will continue to monitor the situation.

Spirit AeroSystems 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Other assets included   $140   of receivables related to indemnifications from Spirit AeroSystems, Inc. (Spirit), for costs incurred related to pension and retiree medical obligations of former Boeing employees that were subsequently employed by Spirit. During the fourth quarter of 2014, Boeing filed a complaint against Spirit in Delaware Superior Court seeking to enforce our rights to indemnification and to recover from Spirit amounts incurred by Boeing for pension and retiree medical obligations. We expect to fully recover from Spirit.  
   
  Note   8     Commitments and Contingencies 
  Environmental 
  The following table summarizes environmental remediation activity during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

The liabilities recorded represent our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. It is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. As part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. There are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by   $873   and   $853  . 
  Product Warranties 
  The following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Commercial Aircraft Commitments 
  In conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. The probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. Trade-in commitments, which  
  
   14 

     Table of Contents  

can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer. 
  Trade-in commitment agreements at   September 30, 2016   have expiration dates from   2016   through   2026  . At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   total contractual trade-in commitments were   $1,385   and   $1,585  . As of   September 30, 2016     and   December 31, 2015  , we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling   $170   and   $240   and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was   $170   and   $240  . 
  Financing Commitments 
  Financing commitments, which include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns, totaled   $17,425   and   $16,283   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of   September 30, 2016   are as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $15,266   of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. We have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided. 
  Standby Letters of Credit and Surety Bonds 
  We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately   $4,368   and   $4,968   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Commitments to ULA 
  We and Lockheed Martin Corporation have each committed to provide ULA with additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , ULA s total remaining obligation to Boeing under the inventory supply agreement was   $120  . See Note   4  .

F/A-18 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our backlog included   28   F/A-18 aircraft under contract with the U.S. Navy. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, passed in December 2015, funds   12   additional F/A-18 aircraft that, combined with the orders in backlog, would complete production in mid-2018. The President s Fiscal Year 2017 Budget request submitted in February 2016 includes funding for   two   additional F/A-18 aircraft. In May 2016, both congressional appropriations committees included additional F/A-18s in their proposed FY17 defense funding bills. The Senate bill includes funding for   14   F/A-18s and the House bill includes funding for a total of   16   F/A-18s. On September 28, 2016, the White House approved the proposed sale of up to   40   F/A-18 aircraft to Kuwait subject to the Congressional Notification process. We are continuing to work with our U.S. customers as well as international customers to secure additional orders that would extend the program beyond 2018. Should additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide to end production of the F/A-18 in 2018. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shutdown, including any recovery that may be available from the U.S. government. 
  United States Government Defense Environment Overview 
  The enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 in November 2015 established overall defense spending levels for FY2016 and FY2017. However, uncertainty remains with respect to levels of defense spending for FY2018 and beyond including risk of future sequestration cuts. 
  Significant uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (  U.S. DoD  ) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company's operations, financial position and/or cash flows. 
  On September 29, 2016 a continuing resolution was enacted to fund the U.S. government through December 9, 2016. After this date, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the   U.S. DoD   or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. 
  BDS Fixed-Price Development Contracts 
  Fixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. BDS fixed-price contracts with significant development work include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. The operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Changes to cost and revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. For example, during 2016, we have recorded additional reach-forward losses of   $816   on the KC-46A Tanker program and a charge of   $162   resulting from a reach-forward loss of   $38   on the Commercial Crew Program. Moreover, both of these programs remain subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays, or increased costs.

     Table of Contents  

KC-46A Tanker    
  In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at   $4.9 billion   and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In August 2016, the   USAF   authorized LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at   $2.8 billion  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $298   of capitalized precontract costs and   $690   of potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with aircraft we expect USAF to authorize in the future. 
  Recoverable Costs on Government Contracts   
  Our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the U.S. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. We work with the U.S. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. If we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the U.S. government. 
  Russia/Ukraine 
  We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted. 
  747 Program 
  Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic have continued to drive market uncertainties, pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. As a result, during the second quarter of 2016, we canceled previous plans to return to a production rate of   1.0   aircraft per month beginning in 2019, resulting in a reduction in the program accounting quantity from   1,574   to   1,555   aircraft. This reduction in the program accounting quantity, together with lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs associated with producing fewer airplanes, resulted in a reach-forward loss of   $1,188   in the second quarter. We previously recognized reach-forward losses of   $885   and   $70   during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, respectively, related to the prior decision to reduce the production rate to   0.5   per month and lower estimated revenue from future sales due to ongoing pricing and market pressures. We reduced the rate from   1.0   to   0.5   per month in September 2016. The adjusted program accounting quantity includes   27   undelivered aircraft, currently scheduled to be produced through 2019. We continue to have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747. 
  787 Program 
  The 787 program continues to have near breakeven gross margins. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability. If risks related to this program, including risks associated with productivity improvements, supply chain management, planned production rate increases or introducing and manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could record a reach-forward loss that may be material.

Note   9     Arrangements with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
  We enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees. 
  The following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. The maximum potential payments represent a  worst-case scenario,  and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities represents the amount included in Accrued liabilities. 

Contingent Repurchase Commitments   The repurchase price specified in contingent repurchase commitments is generally lower than the expected fair value at the specified repurchase date. Estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date. 
  Indemnifications to ULA   In 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of   $1,360   of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus   $1,860   of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA has consumed   $1,278   of the   $1,360   of inventory that was contributed by us and has yet to consume   $82  . Under the inventory supply agreement, we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of   $1,436   through   September 30, 2016  . ULA has made payments of   $1,740   to us under the inventory supply agreement and we have made   $63   of net indemnification payments to ULA. 
  We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the   USAF   for   four   satellite missions. In 2009, ULA filed a complaint before the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) for a contract adjustment for the price of two of these missions, followed in 2011 by a subsequent notice of appeal with respect to a third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration of the contract. During the second quarter of 2016, the ASBCA ruled that ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing for each of the three missions and remanded to the parties to negotiate appropriate pricing. However, if the USAF appeals the ASBCA's ruling, and ULA is ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for an indemnification payment up to   $261   and may record up to   $277   in pre-tax losses associated with the   three   missions.

Potential payments for Other Delta contracts include   $85   related to deferred support costs and   $91   related to deferred production costs. In June 2011, the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) notified ULA that it had determined that   $271   of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. In December 2011, the DCMA notified ULA of the potential non-recoverability of an additional   $114   of deferred production costs.   ULA   and Boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in November 2011, ULA filed a certified claim with the USAF for collection of deferred support and production costs. The USAF issued a final decision denying   ULA   s certified claim in May 2012. On June 14, 2012, Boeing and ULA filed a suit in the Court of Federal Claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the U.S. government. On November 9, 2012, the U.S. government filed an answer to our claim and asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. We believe that the U.S. government s counterclaim is without merit, and have filed an answer challenging it on multiple grounds. The litigation is in the discovery phase, and the Court has not yet set a trial date. If, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ULA for up to   $317   of the costs questioned by the DCMA. 
  Other Indemnifications   In conjunction with our sales of Electron Dynamic Devices, Inc. and Rocketdyne Propulsion and Power businesses and our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. We are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). As a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. To the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in Note   8  . 
  Credit Guarantees   We have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. A substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. Our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. Current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next   four   years. 
   
  Note   10     Debt 
  On   May 18, 2016  , we issued   $1,200   of fixed rate senior notes consisting of   $400   due   June 15, 2023   that bear an annual interest rate of   1.875%  ,   $400   due   June 15, 2026   that bear an annual interest rate of   2.25%  , and   $400   due   June 15, 2046   that bear an annual interest rate of   3.375%  . The notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The net proceeds of the issuance totaled   $1,170  , after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses.

  Restricted Stock Units 
  On   February 22, 2016  , we granted to our executives   777,837     restricted stock units   (  RSU  s) as part of our long-term incentive program with a grant date fair value of   $117.50   per unit. The   RSU  s granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. 
  Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units 
  On   February 22, 2016  , we granted to our executives   721,176     performance-based restricted stock units   (  PBRSU  s) as part of our long-term incentive program with a grant date fair value of   $126.74   per unit. Compensation expense for the award is recognized over the   three  -year performance period based upon the grant date fair value estimated using a Monte-Carlo simulation model. The model used the following assumptions: expected volatility of   22.44%   based upon historical stock volatility, a risk-free interest rate of   0.92%  , and no expected dividend yield because the units earn dividend equivalents.

Note   14     Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Cash Flow Hedges 
  Our cash flow hedges include foreign currency forward contracts and commodity purchase contracts. We use foreign currency forward contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. Our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions through   2021  . We use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. Our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through   2020  . 
  Fair Value Hedges 
  Interest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. The net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in Boeing Capital interest expense. 
  Derivative Instruments Not Receiving Hedge Accounting Treatment 
  We have entered into agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and international business requirements. These agreements are derivative instruments for accounting purposes. The quantities of aluminum in these agreements offset and are priced at prevailing market prices. We also hold certain foreign currency forward contracts which do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. 
  Notional Amounts and Fair Values 
  The notional amounts and fair values of derivative instruments in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were as follows:

Gains/(losses) associated with our cash flow and undesignated hedging transactions and their effect on Other comprehensive income/(loss) and Net earnings were as follows:    

Based on our portfolio of cash flow hedges, we expect to reclassify losses of   $70   (pre-tax) out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffectiveness related to our hedges recognized in Other income was insignificant for the   nine and three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  We have derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features. For foreign exchange contracts with original maturities of at least five years, our derivative counterparties could require settlement if we default on our five-year credit facility. For certain commodity contracts, our counterparties could require collateral posted in an amount determined by our credit ratings. The fair value of foreign exchange and commodity contracts that have credit-risk-related contingent features that are in a net liability position at   September 30, 2016   was   $42  . At   September 30, 2016  , there was no collateral posted related to our derivatives.

Note   15     Fair Value Measurements 
  The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. The following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy.  

Money market funds, available-for-sale debt investments and equity securities are valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments.  
  Derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. Our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. Commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. The fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve. 
  Certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3). The following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the   nine months ended September 30   due to long-lived asset impairment and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date: 

The fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. The values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. Management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. Under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic  
  
   24 

     Table of Contents  

aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. Property, plant and equipment and Acquired intangible assets were primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. 
  For Level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets.

               (2)   
    The negative amount represents the sum for all aircraft subject to fair value measurement, of all downward adjustments based on consideration of individual aircraft attributes and condition. The positive amount represents the sum of all such upward adjustments. 
     Fair Value Disclosures 
  The fair values and related carrying values of financial instruments that are not required to be remeasured at fair value on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position were as follows: 

The fair value of Accounts receivable is based on current market rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. The fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying amounts. The fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. The fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as Level 2 and is based on current market yields. For our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as Level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. The fair values of our debt classified as Level 3 are based on discounted cash flow models using the implied yield

     Table of Contents  

from similar securities. With regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. Items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, Accounts payable and long-term payables. The carrying values of those items, as reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, approximate their fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using Level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (Level 1). 
   
  Note   16     Legal Proceedings 
  Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us.  
  In addition, we are subject to various U.S. government inquiries and investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  
   
  Note   17     Segment Information 
  Effective during the first quarter of 2016, certain programs were realigned between   Boeing Military Aircraft   and   Global Services   Support   segments. Business segment data for 2015 have been adjusted to reflect the realignment.  
  Our primary profitability measurements to review a segment s operating results are Earnings from operations and operating margins. See page   6   for a Summary of Business Segment Data, which is an integral part of this note. 
  Intersegment revenues, eliminated in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, are shown in the following table.

     Table of Contents  

Unallocated Items, Eliminations and other 
  Unallocated items, eliminations and other includes costs not attributable to business segments as well as intercompany profit eliminations. We generally allocate costs to business segments based on the U.S. federal cost accounting standards. Components of Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table. 

Unallocated Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Expense 
  Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense represent the portion of pension and other postretirement benefit costs that are not recognized by business segments for segment reporting purposes. Pension costs, comprising   Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America   (  GAAP  ) service and prior service costs, are allocated to Commercial Airplanes. Pension costs are allocated to   BDS   using   U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards   (  CAS  ), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than   GAAP  . These costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to business segments based on   CAS  , which is generally based on benefits paid.  
  Assets 
  Segment assets are summarized in the table below: 

Assets included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other primarily consist of Cash and cash equivalents, Short-term and other investments, Deferred tax assets, capitalized interest and assets held by   Shared Services Group   as well as intercompany eliminations.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM 
  To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of 
  The Boeing Company 
  Chicago, Illinois 
  We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position of The Boeing Company and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of   September 30, 2016  , and the related condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three-month and   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and the related condensed consolidated statements of cash flows and equity for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30  , 2016 and 2015. These interim financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. 
  We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). A review of interim financial information consists principally of applying analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the objective of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion. 
  Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material modifications that should be made to such condensed consolidated interim financial statements for them to be in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 
  We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated statement of financial position of the Company as of   December 31, 2015  , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for the year then ended (not presented herein); and in our report dated February 10, 2016, we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of   December 31, 2015   is fairly stated, in all material respects, in relation to the consolidated statement of financial position from which it has been derived.

    These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See page   48   for important information about these non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures. 
     Revenues 
  The following table summarizes Revenues: 

Revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $1,256 million   compared with the same period in   2015  . Commercial Airplanes revenues   decreased   by   $1,122 million   primarily due to lower airplane volume.   Defense, Space   Security   (  BDS  ) revenues   increased   by   $35 million  , due to higher revenues in   Global Services   Support   (  GS S  ), partially offset by lower revenues in   Network   Space Systems   (  N SS  ) and   Boeing Military Aircraft   (  BMA  ).  
  Revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $1,951 million   compared with the same period in   2015  . Commercial Airplanes revenues   decreased   by   $719 million   primarily due to lower volume.   BDS   revenues   decreased     $842 million  , or   10%  , due to lower revenues in the   BMA   and   N SS   segments, partially offset by higher revenues in   GS S  .  
  The change in unallocated items and eliminations primarily reflects the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries.

Earnings From Operations 
  The following table summarizes Earnings from operations: 

Earnings from operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $2,631 million   compared with the same period in   2015   due to lower earnings at Commercial Airplanes, partially offset by lower unallocated pension and postretirement expense. Commercial Airplanes earnings for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased by   $2,934 million   due to the reach-forward losses on the 747 program of   $1,258 million   recorded during the first half of 2016, the reclassification of   $1,235 million   of 787 flight test aircraft costs, as well as lower volume and mix. During the second quarter of 2016, we reclassified   $1,235 million   of costs to research and development related to two 787 flight test aircraft as a result of our determination that those aircraft are no longer commercially saleable.  
  During the first half of 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of   $816 million   on the KC-46A Tanker program of which   $516 million   was recorded at Commercial Airplanes and   $300 million   at our   BMA   segment. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded KC-46A Tanker program reach-forward losses   $835 million   of which   $513 million   was recorded at Commercial Airplanes and   $322 million   at our   BMA   segment.  
  Earnings from operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $298 million  . Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased   $171 million   primarily due to lower volume and mix, offset by lower period costs. BDS earnings from operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $238 million  , primarily due to lower earnings in the   N SS   and   BMA   segments, partially offset by higher earnings in the   GS S   segment.  
  The earnings decreases for the   nine and three months ended September 30, 2016   are offset by unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit income recorded in 2016 compared with expense recorded in the comparable prior year periods. 
  Core operating earnings for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $3,082 million   compared with the same period in   2015   primarily due to the 747 charges and the reclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft described above, as well as delivery mix at Commercial Airplanes. Core operating earnings for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased by   $443 million   due to lower earnings at   N SS   and Commercial Airplanes.

     Table of Contents  

Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other   The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table: 

* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and postretirement benefit expense. See page   48  . 
  The deferred compensation expense   increased   by   $28 million   and   $71 million   for the   nine and three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the same periods in   2015   primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.  
  Eliminations and other unallocated loss increased by   $10 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and decreased by   $23 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the same periods in   2015   primarily due to the timing of the elimination of profit on intercompany aircraft deliveries and expense allocations.  
  The components of net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following table: 

The   decrease   in net periodic pension benefit cost for the   nine and three months ended September 30, 2016   of   $1,631 million   and   $569 million   compared with the same periods in   2015   is primarily due to lower service costs and lower amortization of actuarial losses. The lower service costs reflect the changes to our retirement plans whereby certain employees transitioned in 2016 to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. The lower amortization of actuarial losses reflects actuarial gains in 2015 resulting from the year-end discount rate increase from 3.9% to 4.2%. In 2014, the discount rate decreased to 3.9% from 4.8% resulting in actuarial losses. 
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note   17  . Net periodic pension benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:  

The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings was a benefit of   $129 million   and   $50 million   for the   nine and three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with expense of   $293 million   and   $84 million   for the same periods in   2015  . The 2016 benefits reflect the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period. The 2015 unallocated expense reflects the amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years.  
  Other Earnings Items    

For discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note   3   to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Total Costs and Expenses ( Cost of Sales ) 
  Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales and   BDS   predominantly uses contract accounting. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. The following table summarizes cost of sales: 

Cost of sales for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $120 million   compared with the same period in   2015  , primarily due to lower volume, partially offset by the 747 reach-forward loss at Commercial Airplanes. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was approximately   86.0%   in the   nine  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

months ended September 30, 2016   compared with approximately   84.7%   in the same period in   2015   primarily driven by the 747 charges recorded in the second quarter of 2016.  
  Cost of sales for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $1,696 million  , or   8%  , compared with the same period in   2015  . Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes   decreased   by   $610 million  , or   4%   while   BDS     decreased   by   $581 million  , or   9%  , primarily due to lower volume. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was approximately   83.3%   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with approximately   83.6%   in the same period in   2015  . 
  Research and Development   The following table summarizes our Research and development expense:   

  Research and development expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $1,475 million   compared with the same period in   2015   primarily due to the reclassification of   $1,235 million   of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher spending on 777X at Commercial Airplanes. 
  Backlog   

  Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   December 31, 2015   was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. 
  Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The unobligated backlog of   $13,115 million   at   September 30, 2016   increased from   December 31, 2015   primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to   BDS   contracts. 
   
  Additional Considerations 
  KC-46A Tanker   In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the   U.S. Air Force   (  USAF  ) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The   KC-46A Tanker   is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. The EMD contract is currently in the certification and flight testing phases. In 2015, we began work on low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft for the USAF. During the third quarter, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the   USAF   authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion.  
  Through 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,260 million related to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded further reach-forward losses of $243 million which were primarily driven by higher than anticipated certification and test rework and the change incorporation impact to EMD and LRIP aircraft. In the second quarter of 2016, technical complexities and schedule delays resulted in additional charges of $573 million for reach-forward losses. The second quarter charges were driven by  
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

costs associated with certification delays and higher costs associated with the overall revised schedule, as well as a boom axial load issue that required a hardware solution, and production concurrency between late-stage development testing and the initial production aircraft. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays or increased costs.  
  The first tanker delivery is expected to occur in late 2017 with 18 fully operational aircraft to be delivered in early 2018. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion.  
   
  Russia/Ukraine   We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted. 
   
  Export-Import Bank of the United States   Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the bank s board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources.  
   
  Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
  Commercial Airplanes 
  Business Environment and Trends 
  Airline Industry Environment  
  Our updated 20-year forecast, published in July 2016, projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.8% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.9% average annual GDP growth, we project a $5.9 trillion market for approximately 39,600 new airplanes over the next 20 years. We continue to monitor near-term market conditions in the wide-body segment. If sufficient wide-body orders do not materialize in the next several quarters, we may consider appropriate adjustments to our production rates.

     Earnings From Operations  
  Earnings from operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $2,934 million   compared with the same period in   2015  . The decrease in earnings and operating margins is primarily due to higher research and development costs of   $1,481 million   and a reach-forward loss of   $1,258 million   on the 747 program, as well as lower volume and mix. Research and development costs reflect the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of   $1,235 million   related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned costs related to the 777X program. Earnings include reach-forward losses related to the KC-46A Tanker of   $516 million   recorded in the first half of 2016 compared with   $513 million   in the comparable period of 2015.  
  Earnings from operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $171 million   compared with the same period in   2015   primarily due to lower volume and mix, offset by lower period costs. 
  Backlog 
  The decrease in contractual backlog during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was due to deliveries in excess of net orders.

Accounting Quantity 
  The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. 

* At   September 30, 2016  , the 747 accounting quantity has   27   undelivered aircraft, including 20 that have not been sold or may be remarketed.  
  ** The accounting quantity for the 777X will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 
   
  Program Highlights 
  737 Program   The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 200 units during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and by 600 units during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   due to the program s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 42 per month and plan to increase to 47 per month in 2017. We plan to further increase the rate to 52 per month in 2018 and to 57 per month in 2019. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017. 
   
  747 Program   Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic have continued to drive market uncertainties, pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. As a result, during the second quarter of 2016, we canceled previous plans to return to a production rate of 1.0 aircraft per month beginning in 2019, resulting in a reduction in the program accounting quantity from 1,574 to 1,555 aircraft. This reduction in the program accounting quantity, together with lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs associated with producing fewer airplanes, resulted in a reach-forward loss of   $1,188 million   in the second quarter. We previously recognized reach-forward losses of   $885 million   and   $70 million   during the second half of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, respectively, related to our prior decision to reduce the production rate to 0.5 per month and anticipating lower estimated revenue from future sales due to ongoing pricing and market pressures. We reduced the rate from 1.0 to 0.5 per month in September 2016. The adjusted program accounting quantity includes   27   undelivered aircraft, currently scheduled to be produced through 2019. We continue to have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747. 
   
  767 Program   The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 due to the program s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We increased the combined tanker and commercial production rate from 1.5 per month to 2 per month in April of 2016. We plan to further increase the rate to 2.5 per month in the fourth quarter of 2017.  
  
   38 

Table of Contents  

777 Program   We are currently producing at a rate of 8.3 per month and plan to reduce the rate to 7 per month in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020.  
   
  787 Program   During the second quarter of 2016, we began producing at a rate of     12 per month. We are planning a further rate increase to 14 per month by the end of the decade. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. The accounting quantity of 1,300 units remains unchanged.  
  We remain focused on improving productivity and obtaining additional orders to support planned production. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly for both the 787-8 and 787-9, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as completing and delivering early build aircraft.  
  During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with those airplanes were included in research and development expense. We produced the fourth and fifth flight test aircraft in 2009 but have been unable to sell them at acceptable prices. The aircraft have been used extensively for flight and ground testing and we intended to begin to refurbish the aircraft in early 2017 for commercial sale based on sales activity and market interest. However, during the second quarter of 2016 we determined that firm orders for these aircraft prior to refurbishment were now unlikely, and that the Company would not invest company funds for their refurbishment. The Company also determined the costs to refurbish the aircraft at a future date would be prohibitively expensive. We have therefore determined that the aircraft are not commercially saleable, and accordingly, costs of   $1,235 million   associated with these aircraft were reclassified from 787 program inventory to research and development expense during the second quarter of 2016. We have firm orders for the six remaining undelivered early build aircraft and plan to complete retrofitting them by the end of 2017. 
  The combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability and we continue to have near breakeven gross margins. If risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with planned production rate increases and productivity improvements, supply chain management or introducing or manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. 
   
  Additional Considerations 
  The development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become

necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. 
   
  Defense, Space   Security 
  Business Environment and Trends 
  United States Government Defense Environment Overview   The enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 in November 2015 established overall defense spending levels for FY2016 and FY2017. However, uncertainty remains with respect to levels of defense spending for FY2018 and beyond, including risk of future sequestration cuts. 
  Significant uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (  U.S. DoD  ) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company's operations, financial position and/or cash flows. 
  On September 29, 2016 a continuing resolution was enacted to fund the U.S. government through December 9, 2016. After this date, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the   U.S. DoD   or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. 
   
  Results of Operations 

Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.

Revenues 
  BDS   revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $35 million   compared with the same period in   2015   due to higher revenues of   $925 million   in the   GS S   segment, partially offset by lower revenues of   $551 million   and   $339 million   in the   N SS   and BMA segments. 
  BDS   revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $842 million   compared with the same period in   2015   due to lower revenues of   $777 million   and   $426 million   in the   BMA   and   N SS   segments, partially offset by higher revenues of   $361 million   in the   GS S   segment. 
  Earnings From Operations 
  BDS   earnings from operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $112 million   compared with the same period in   2015   due to lower earnings of   $227 million   in the   N SS   segment, partially offset by higher earnings of   $69 million   and   $46 million   in the BMA and   GS S   segments.  
  BDS earnings from operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $238 million   compared with the same period in   2015   due to lower earnings of   $210 million   and   $60 million   in the   N SS   and   BMA   segments, partially offset by higher earnings of   $32 million   in the   GS S   segment. 
  Backlog 
  BDS   total backlog was   $53,023 million   at   September 30, 2016  , reflecting a   decrease   of   8%   from   December 31, 2015  . For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. 
  Additional Considerations 
  Our   BDS   business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include   Ground-based Midcourse Defense   (  GMD  ), Proprietary and   Space Launch System   (  SLS  ) programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the

     Table of Contents  

technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and commercial and military satellites. 
  Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract s inception-to-date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the   nine and three months ended September 30, 2016  , net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all BDS contracts decreased Earnings from operations by   $127 million   and   $56 million  . For the   nine months and three months ended September 30, 2015   net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all BDS contracts increased Earnings from operations by   $129 million   and   $210 million  .

Revenues 
  BMA   revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $339 million   compared with the same period in   2015   primarily due to lower revenues of $720 million related to fewer C-17 deliveries and timing and mix of deliveries on the CH-47 Chinook and F/A-18 programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher volume on the JDAM and Harpoon programs as well as timing and mix of deliveries on the F-15 program. 
  BMA   revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $777 million   compared with the same period in   2015   primarily due to lower revenues of $932 million related to fewer C-17 deliveries and the absence of a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015 resulting from F-15 contract negotiations. These decreases were partially offset by higher revenues related to timing and mix of deliveries on the Apache program. 
  Earnings From Operations  
  BMA   earnings from operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $69 million   compared with the same period in   2015   primarily due to higher volume and mix on the F-15 and Apache programs and lower spending on proprietary programs, partially offset by lower volume and mix on the CH-47 Chinook and C-17 programs. Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were   $141 million   higher in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   than in the same period in   2015   primarily driven by the absence of favorable F-15 program adjustments recorded in the third quarter of 2015.

  Cash Flow Summary 

Operating Activities   Net cash provided by operating activities was   $7.7 billion   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   $6.2 billion   in the same period in   2015  , an   increase   of   1.5 billion  . The year-over-year improvement primarily reflects lower expenditures on commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787. Advances and progress billings balances decreased by   $1.8 billion   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Investing Activities   Cash used by investing activities was   $2.0 billion   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   $1.0 billion   during the same period in   2015  , largely due to lower net proceeds from investments in time deposits. We expect capital expenditures in   2016   to be higher than   2015   due to continued investment to support growth.

Financing Activities   Cash used by financing activities was   $8.0 billion   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   $7.6 billion   in the same period in   2015  , primarily due to higher share repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by higher new borrowings and lower debt repayments. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   we issued   $1.3 billion   of debt compared with   $0.8 billion   during the same period in   2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , the recorded balance of debt was   $10.5 billion   of which   $0.6 billion   was classified as short-term. This includes   $2.4 billion   of debt attributable to   BCC  , the vast majority of which was classified as long-term. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   51.4 million   shares totaling   $6.5 billion   through our open market share repurchase program. In addition,   $0.7 million   shares were transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At   September 30, 2016  , the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 14, 2015, totaled   $7.5 billion  . 
  Capital Resources   We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. 
  Financing commitments totaled   $17.4 billion   and   $16.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. 
  In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.

  Environmental Remediation   We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of   $576 million   at   September 30, 2016  . For additional information, see Note   8   to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Income Taxes   As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   $1,378 million   of unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note   3   to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  Non-GAAP Measures 
  Core Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per Share 
  Our unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements are prepared in accordance with   Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America   (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of certain pension and other postretirement benefit expenses that are not allocated to business segments. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to Commercial Airplanes. Pension costs allocated to BDS segments are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings was a benefit of   $129 million   and   $50 million   for the   nine and three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with an expense of   $293 million   and   $84 million   for the same periods in   2015  . The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period. The 2015 unallocated expense reflects the amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management s Discussion and Analysis on page   33   of this Form 10-Q and on page   46   of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost, primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.
