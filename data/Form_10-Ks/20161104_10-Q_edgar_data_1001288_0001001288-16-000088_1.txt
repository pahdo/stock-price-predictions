1  .          BASIS OF   PRESENTATION   
                 
              The accompanying interim Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements are unaudited; however, in the opinion of management of Lexmark International, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the  Company  or  Lexmark ),   all adjustments necessary f  or a fair statement of the interim financial results have been included. All adjustments included were of a normal recurring nature  . The results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year. The Conso  lidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position data as of December 31,   2015   was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United   States of America ( U.S. ). The Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,   2015  , on Form 10-K, which included all information and no  tes necessary for such presentation. Accordingly, these financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31,   2015  .  

2  .           BUSINESS COMBINATIONS  
                 
              Pending   Acquisition of Lexmark International, Inc.  
                 
              In 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the exploration of strateg  ic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. On April 19, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger ( Merger Agreement ) providing for the acquisition of the Company by a consortium composed of Apex Technology Co., Ltd., PAG Asia Capi  tal and Legend Capital Management Co., Ltd. (the  Consortium ) in a cash transaction for $  40.50   per share.   The Company s shareholders approved the Merger Agreement on July 22, 2016.   On September 30, 2016, t  he Company and the Consortium announced that they have received clearance from   the   Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) to proceed with the proposed transaction.     As a precondition to CFIUS clearance of the transaction, CFIUS requi  red that the Company and the Consortium enter into a National Security Agreement with the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security.     The merger remains subject to   certain regulatory   approval  s   and other customary closing conditions.   While t  here can be no   certainty that the   merger   w  ill be successfully consummated, the Company expects the merger to close in 2016.  
                 
              Kofax Limited  
                 
              The Company completed its acquisition of Kofax Limited ( Kofax ) on May 21, 2015. The purchase of Kofax is included in   Purchase of   businesses, net of cash acquired   in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in the amount of $  974.5   million.  
                 
              In the six months ended June 30, 2016 the Company recorded meas  urement period adjustments that increased Accrued expenses and other current liabilities by $  2.1   million, decreased Deferred tax liability, net by $  3.0   million, increased Other long-term liabilities by $  0.1   million, and decreased Goodwill by $  0.8   million. The measurement period adjustments to the previously recorded amounts reflect facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisitio  n date primarily arising from additional analysis of tax attributes and tax returns during the six months ended June 30, 2016, and were reflected   in the financial statements   during the six months ended June 30, 2016. The portion of the adjustment recorded   in earnings during the six months ended June 30, 2016 that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date was not significant. The Company s accounting for   the acquisition of Kofax is now complete.  
                 
              The unaudited pro forma results presented below include the effects of the acquisition of Kofax as if it had been completed as of January 1, 2014, the beginning of the comparable annual reporting period prior to t  he year of acquisition. Such unaudited pro forma financial results do not give pro forma effect to any other transaction or event. In addition, the unaudited pro forma results do not include any anticipated synergies or other expected benefits of the acqui  sition or costs necessary to obtain the anticipated synergies and benefits. Accordingly, the unaudited pro forma financial information below is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had t  he acquisition been completed as of January 1, 2014.  
                 
              The unaudited pro forma results include the amortization associated with an estimate for the acquired intangible assets and interest expense associated with debt used to fund the acquisition, as well as   fair value adjustments for deferred revenue. The unaudited pro forma provision for income taxes has also been adjusted for all periods, based upon the foregoing and following adjustments to historical results and using a   37.8%   bl  ended tax rate representing the combined U.S. federal and state statutory rates. There is no material effect to the unaudited pro forma results presented below related to retrospectively adjusting Kofax s historical results for the    

6  

change in accounting met  hodology for pension and other postretirement benefit plans adopted by Lexmark in the fourth quarter of 2013.  

Unaudited pro forma earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 do not reflect acquisition-related costs of $  1.3   million and $  37.8   million that were historically recognized by Lexmark and Kofax in these respective periods. Unaudited pro forma earnings for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 do not reflect $  8.7   million of acquisition-related compensation   expenses. The acquisition-related costs and acquisition-related compensation expenses will not have an ongoing effect on the results of the combined entity.  
                 
              Claron Technology, Inc.  
                 
              The Company s acquisition of Claron Technology, Inc. ( Claron ) in 2015 is included in   Purchase of businesses, net of cash acquired   in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 in the amount of $  30.3   million.      

3  .          RESTRUCTURING CHARGES   
                 
              2016 Restructuring Actions  
                 
              General  
                 
              On February 23, 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions (the  2016 Restructuring Actions ) designed to incr  ease profitability and operational efficiency primarily in its ISS segment. These restructuring actions are focused on optimizing the Company s ISS structure, primarily in reaction to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar, and are also aligned with the   previously announced strategic alternatives process.  
                 
              The 2016 Restructuring Actions are expected to impact about 550 positions worldwide through December 2016, with a portion of the positions being shifted to low-cost countries. The 2016 Restructuring Ac  tions will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $32 million, with approximately $  29   million incurred to date and the remainder to be incurred in 2016. The total cash costs of the 2016 Restructuring Actions will be approx  imately $30 million, of   which $29   million has been incurred to date and the remainder to be incurred in 2016.  
                 
              The Company expects to incur total   pre-tax   charges upon completion of the 2016 Restructuring Actions of approximately $30 million in ISS and approximately $2 million in   All Other.  
                 
              Impact to   2016   Financial Results  
                 
               For the   three   months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   reversals of   the Company s 2016 Restructuring Act  ions     were recorded in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings as follows:

For the   three and nine     months     ended     September 30, 2016  , the     Company incurred restructuring   charges   (reversals) in connection with the 2016 Restructuring Actions in the Company s segments as follows:  

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred employee termination benefit charges (reversals), which include severance, medical and other benefits. The Company experienced higher levels of attrition than expected during the first   nine months   of 2016 as a result of the strategic   alternatives process as well as announced restructuring programs.  These higher levels of attrition reduced the expected termination benefits resulting in the reversals.  The Company s cost savings and headcount reduction targets have not changed related   to these restructuring actions.  Charges (reversals) for the 2016 Restructuring Actions and all of the other restructuring actions were recorded in accordance with FASB guidance on employers  accounting for postemployment benefits and guidance on accountin  g for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, as appropriate.  
                 
              Pension and postretirement plan curtailment and termination benefit losses (gains) related to the 2016 Restructuring Actions were not included in the tables above. Refer to Note 10 o  f the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for more information.  
                 
              Liability Rollforward  
                 
               The following table represents a rollforward of the liability incurred for employee termination benefits in connection with the 2016 Restructuring Actions. The total restructuring liability as of   September 30, 2016   is included in   Accrued liabilities   on the Company s Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position.   

(1) Reversals due to changes in estimates for employee termination benefits and attrition.  
              (2) Other consists of changes in the liability balance due to foreign   currency translations.  
                   
              2015 Restructuring Actions  
                 
              General  
                 
              On July 21, 2015, the Company announced restructuring actions (the  2015 Restructuring Actions ) designed to increase profitability and operational efficiency. These Company-wide restructuring actions are broad-based but primarily capture the anticipated c  ost and expense synergies from the Kofax and   ReadSoft AB ( ReadSoft )   acquisitions. Primary Company-wide impact will be general and administrative, marketing and development positions as well as the consolidation of regional facilities.  
                 
              The 2015 Restructu  ring Actions are expected to impact about 500 positions worldwide through December 2016, with a portion of the positions being shifted to low-cost countries. The 2015 Restructuring Actions will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $  30   million,   all of which has been incurred to date. The total cash costs of the 2015 Restructuring Actions will be approximately $  28   million, all of which has been incurred to date.  
                 
              The Company expects to incur total   pre-tax   charges upon completion of the 2015   Restructuring Actions of approximately $  8   million in ISS, approximately $  3   million in All Other and approximately $  19   million in Enterprise Software.

The Company exp  erienced higher levels of attrition than expected during the first   nine months   of 2016 as a result of the strategic alternatives process as well as announced restructuring programs.   These higher levels of attrition reduced the expected termination benefits   resulting in the reversals.  The Company s cost savings and headcount reduction targets have not changed related to these restructuring actions.  Charges (reversals) for the 2015 Restructuring Actions and all of the other restructuring actions were record  ed in accordance with FASB guidance on employers  accounting for postemployment benefits and guidance on accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, as appropriate.  
                 
               For the     three and nine months   ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company incurred restructuring charges (reversals) in connection with the   2015 Restructuring Actions   in the Company s segments as follows:

              Summary of Other Restructuring Actions  
                 
              General  
                 
              As part of Lexmark s ongoing strategy to increase the focus of its talent and resources on higher usage business platforms, the Company announced various restructuring acti  ons ( Other Restructuring Actions ) over the past several years. The Other Restructuring Actions primarily include exiting the development and manufacturing of the Company s remaining inkjet hardware, with reductions primarily in the areas of inkjet-relate  d manufacturing, research and development, supply chain, marketing and sales as well as other support functions. The Other Restructuring Actions are considered substantially completed and any remaining charges to be incurred from these actions are expected   to be immaterial.

4  .          DEBT  
                 
               The carrying value of the Company s outstanding long-term debt consists of the following:   

In addition to the information in the table above, during   2016     the Company   borrowed an additional $  29.0   million and   repaid $  73.0   million   of borrowings which is presented gross on the   Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows  . The Company presents borrowings and repayments of less than 90 days on a net basis on the Consolid  ated Statements of Cash Flows and such amounts were $  543.0   million and $  543.0   million, respectively, for the   nine   months   ended   September 30, 2016   and $  390.0   million and $  361.0   million, respectively, for the   nine   months ended   Septem  ber 30, 2015  .  
                 
              Trade Receivables Facility  
                 
              In the U.S., the Company  ,   Lexmark Enterprise Software, LLC (   LESL   )   and Kofax, Inc.   transfer a majority of their receivables to a wholly-owned subsidiary, Lexmark Receivables Corporation ( LRC ),     which then may   transfer the receivables on a limited recourse basis to an unrelated third party. The financial results of LRC are included in the Company s consolidated financial results since it is a wholly-owned subsidiary. LRC is a separate legal entity     with its own   separate creditors who, in a liquidation of LRC, would be entitled to be satisfied out of LRC s assets prior to any value in LRC becoming available for equity claims of the Company. The Company accounts for transfers of receivables from LRC to the unrelate  d third party as a secured borrowing with the pledge of its receivables as collateral since LRC has the ability to repurchase the receivables interests at a determinable price. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company ha  d total accounts receivable pledged as collateral of   $  23.2     m  illion held by LRC which were included in   Trade receivables   in the Company s Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position.  
                 
              On August 27, 2015  , the trade re  ceivables facility was amended by extending the term of the facility to October   6  , 201  7  .   In addition, Kofax, Inc. became a new originator under the facility, permitting advancements under the facility as accounts receivables are originated by Kofax, Inc.   and sold to LRC.   The maximum capital availability under the facility remains at   $  125   million under the amended agreement. Interest on borrowings is calculated using daily 1-month LIBOR index or conduit commercial paper rates plus   a spread of   0.40%   along with a liquidity fee of   0.40%  .  
                 
              This facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as specific provisions related to the quality of the accounts receiva  bles transferred. As collections reduce previously transferred receivables, the Company  , LESL and Kofax, Inc.   may replenish these with new receivables. Lexmark  , LESL     and Kofax, Inc.   bear a limited risk of bad debt losses on the trade receivables     transferre  d, since the Company  , LESL and Kofax, Inc.   over-collateralize the receivables transferred with additional eligible receivables. Lexmark  , LESL and Kofax, Inc.   address this risk of loss in the allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables transferred to the u  nrelated third-party may not include amounts over 90 days past due or concentrations over certain limits with any one customer. The facility also contains customary cash control triggering events which, if triggered, could adversely affect the Company s li  quidity and/or its ability to obtain secured borrowings. A downgrade in the Company s credit rating would reduce the amount of secured borrowings available under the facility.  
                 
              Revolving   Credit Facility  
                 
              The Company currently has a   $  500   million  ,     5-year   senior, unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facilit  y with a   maturity date   of   February 5, 2019. The outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility was $  3  08.0   million as of   September 30, 2016     and   $  288.0   million as of December 31,   2015  .  
                 
              The facility provides for the availability of swingline loans and   multicurrency letters of credit. Under certain circumstances and subject to certain conditions, the aggregate amount available under the facility may be increased to a maximum of $  650   million. Interest on swingline borrowings und  er the facility is determined based on the offered rate at the time of the loan. Interest on ABR and Eurocurrency borrowings are based on the Adjusted Base Rate and Adjusted LIBO Rate, respectively, plus in each case a margin that is adjusted on the basis   of a combination of the Company s consolidated leverage ratio and the Company s index debt rating. The    

12  

commitment fee was   0.25%   as of   September 30, 2016  .    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   there were no swingline loans outstanding.  
                 
              The amended credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains certain finan  cial covenants, including those relating to a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than   3.0   to   1.0   and a maximum leverage ratio of not more than   3.0   to   1.0   as defined in the agreement. The amended credit facility also limits, among other things, the Company s indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes to its structure and business. The Company was in compliance with all covenants and o  ther requirements     set forth in the facility agreement at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  .  
                 
              The revolving credit facility contains a  change of control  provision i  n which if there is an acquisition of the Company, the administrative agent and/or the lenders may terminate the commitments and declare the principal and accrued interest on any loans then outstanding immediately due and payable.  
                 
              On March 24, 2016, the r  evolving credit facility was amended for purposes of calculating the minimum interest coverage ratio  ,   the maximum leverage ratio   and t  he maximum permitted indebtedness of the Company   by reducing the impact of certain cash restructuring charges, incurred by   the Company prior to September 30, 2016, in the calculation   of  Consolidated EBITDA .  
                 
              Senior Notes  
                 
                   In March 2013, the Company completed a public debt offering of $  400.0   million aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior unsecured notes. The notes with an aggregate principal amount of $  400.0   million and   5.125%   coupon were priced at   99.9  98%   to have an effective yield to maturity of   5.125%   and will mature March 15, 2020 (referred to as the  2020 senior notes ). The 2020 senior notes rank equally with all existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness. The   notes from the May 2008 public debt offering with an aggregate principal amount of $  300.0   million and   6.65%   coupon were priced at   99.73%   to have an effective yield to maturi  ty of   6.687%   and will mature June 1, 2018 (referred to as the  2018 senior notes ).      At   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance of senior note debt was $  697.  9   million (net of unamortized issuance costs of $  2.0   million and unamortized discount of $  0.1   million). At   December 31, 2015  ,   the outstanding balance was   $  697.3   million (net of unamortized issuance costs of $  2.5   million and unamortized discount of $  0.2   million).  
                 
              The 2020 senior notes pay interest on March 15 and Septemb  er 15 of each year. The 2018 senior notes pay interest on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The interest rate payable on the notes of each series is subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moody s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor s   Ratings Services downgrades the debt rating assigned to the notes to a level below investment grade, or subsequently upgrades the ratings.  
                 
              The senior notes contain typical restrictions on liens, sale leaseback transactions, mergers and sales of assets. There are no sinking fund requirements on the senior notes and they may be redeemed at any time at the option of the Company, at a redemption   price as described in the related indenture agreements, as supplemented and amended, in whole or in part. If a  change of control triggering event  as defined below occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes in cash from   the holders at a price equal to   101%   of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of repurchase. A  change of control triggering event  is defined as the occurrence of both a c  hange of control and a downgrade in the debt rating assigned to the notes to a level below investment grade.  
                 
              Short-Term Debt  
                 
              In June 2015, t  he Company entered into an agreement for an uncommitted revolving credit facility. Under the agreement, the Compan  y may borrow up to a total of   $  100   million  . There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  .  

5  .          INVENTORIES   
                 
               Inventories consist of the following:

6.              ACCRUED   LIABILITIES   AND OTHER LIABILITIES  
                 
              Changes in   the Company s warranty liability for standard warranties and deferred revenue for extended warranties are presented in the tables below:  
                 
               Warranty Liability:   

Deferred Extended Warranty Revenue:   

Both the current portion of warranty and the current portion of extended warranty are included in   Accrued liabilities   on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position. Both the non-current portion of warranty and the non-current portion of extended warranty are included in   Other liabilities   on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position. The   split between the current and non-current portion of the warranty liability is not disclosed separately above due to immaterial amounts in the non-current portion.  
                 
              Restructuring liabilities, included in   Accrued liabilities   on the Consolidated Condensed S  tatement  s of Financial Position, were $  8.8   million as of   September 30, 2016   and $  69.4   million as of   December 31, 2015  , a decrease of $  60.6   million. This decrease was driven primaril  y by severance payments of $  42.3     million   and a   net   reduction in the estimate,   primarily due to employee     attrition, of $  18.3   million  .    

7.                INCOME TAXES   
                 
              The   Provision for income taxes   for the   three   months ended   September   30, 2016 was     an expense   of $  4.8   million or an effective tax rate of     20.6%  , compared to   a benefit   of $  20.  2   million or an effective tax rate of   57.1%   for the   three   months ended   September   30, 2015.   The difference in these rates is primarily due to a shift in the expected geographic distribution of earnings for 2016 compared to 2015 and discrete items recorded in the respective periods.    Additionally, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, the   Company inc  reased income tax benefit by $  0.3   million in recognition of several discrete items, which primarily included a tax benefit related to the release of uncertain tax position accruals and provision-to-return adjustments fo  r 2015 returns filed during the quarter.  The three months ended September 30, 2015 included discrete items related to changes in estimates associated with filing 2014 tax returns, obtaining certification for certain state tax credits, and re-measuring cer  tain non-functional currency foreign deferred tax liabilities totaling a   benefit of   $  10.4   million.  
                 
              The   Provision for income taxes   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 was   an expense   of $  40.5   million or an effective tax rate of   (252.2)%  , compared to   a benefit   of $  3.5   million or an effective tax rate of   10.5%   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015.   The difference in these rates is primarily due   to discrete items totaling $  39.7   million.   At reporting period end, the Company reassesses its uncertain tax posit  ions. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company determined it was no longer more likely than not that a previously recognized uncertain tax benefit will be sustained and therefore increased its reserve for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest   by $  34.9   million during the period ending June 30, 2016  .   The remaining portion of discrete items is primarily related to deferred tax expense associated with a change in the Switzerland applicable tax rate and provision-to-retu  rn adjustments for 2015 returns.     The nine months ended September 30, 2015 included discrete items related to changes in estimates associated with filing 2014 tax returns, obtaining certification for certain state tax credits, resolving certain tax uncertai  nties, and re-measuring certain non-functional currency foreign deferred tax liabilities totaling a benefit of $  7.9   million.    

14  

It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or   decrease in the next 12 months. Such changes could occur based on the expiration of various statutes of limitations or the conclusion of ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world. Accordingly, within the next 12 months, the Company estim  ates that its unrecognized tax benefits amount could decrease by an amount in the range of $  2.5   million to $  48.0   million.   The Company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of the possible increase in the   amount of unrecognized tax benefits that could occur within the next 12 months. However, any such increase is not expected to be material to the Company.  
                 
              The Company s effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   as a result of U.S. state taxes on U.S. earnings and lower tax rates applicable to foreign earnings in most foreign jurisdictions in which the Company operates, most notably, Switzerland.  

8  .          STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY AND ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE EARNINGS (LOSS)  
                 
              In August 2012, the Company received authorization from the Board of Directors to repurchase an additiona  l $  200   million of its Class A Common Stock for a total repurchase authority of $  4.85   billion. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately $  55   million of share repurchase authority remaining. This repurchase authority allows the Company, at management s discretion, to selectively repurchase its stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions depending upon   market price and other factors. The Company paused share repurchases in the second quarter of 2015 following the acquisition of Kofax.  Additionally, the merger agreement includes restrictions prohibiting the Company from repurchasing shares without the p  rior consent of the buying consortium.  
                 
              Treasury Stock  
                 
              The Company did not repurchase any shares of its Class A Common Stock during the   three and   nine   months     ended   September   30, 2016   via accelerated share repurchase agreements ( ASR ).   The Company did not repurchase any shares of its Class A Common Stock during the   three   months ended   September   30, 2015  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company repurchased approximately   0.7   million shares at a cost of $  30   million.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had repurchased approximately   113.0   million shares of its Class A Common Stock for an aggregate cost of approximately   $  4.80   billion since the inception of the program in April 1996. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had reissued approximately   0.5   million previously rep  urchased shares in connection with certain of its employee benefit programs. As a result of these issuances as well as the retirement of   44.0   million,   16.0   million and   16.0   million shares of treasury stock in 2005, 2006 and 2008, respectively, the net treasury shares outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were   36.5   million. Share repurchases for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were executed via an ASR agreement.  
                 
              During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company withheld $  3.7   million of restricted shares to satisfy the minimum amount of its income tax withholding requirements related to certain officer s vested restricted stock units ( RSUs   ). The fair value of the restricted shares withheld was determined on the date that the restricted shares vested and resulted in the withholding of   122,806   shares of the Company s Common Stock during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The shares have been classified as   Treasury stock   on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position. The Company currently expects to satisfy sha  re-based awards with registered shares available to be issued.  
                 
              Dividends  
                 
               The Company s dividend activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was as follows:   

The payment of the cash dividends also resulted in the issuance of dividend equivalent units to certain holders of RSUs, excluding replacement RSUs for the Kofax Long-term Incentive Plan restricted stock awards ( LTIPs ), which did not provide for dividend   equivalent units. Diluted weighted-average Lexmark Class A Common Stock share amounts presented reflect this issuance. All cash dividends and dividend equivalent units are accounted for as reductions of   Retained earnings  .

9  .            EARNINGS     PER     SHARE   ( EPS   )   
                 
               The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS calculations:   

RSUs, stock options, and dividend equivalent units totaling an additional   0.7   million of Class A Common Stock for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   were outstanding but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been antidilutive. Outstanding stock based compensation awards were no  t considered in the diluted EPS calculation due to the Company s net loss position for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   as well as the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
                 
              Under the terms of Lexmark s RSU agreements, other than replacement RSU agreements for Kofax LTIPs, unvested RSU awards contain forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalent units. Because the dividend equivalent units are forfeitable, they are d  efined as non-participating securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   0.2   million dividend equivalent units outstanding, which will vest at the time that the underlying RSU vests  .  
                 
              In addition to the   0.7   million antidilutive shares for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , mentioned above, unvested RSUs with a performance condition that were granted in the fir  st quarter of 2016, 2015 and 2014 were also excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share. According to FASB guidance on earnings per share, contingently issuable shares are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS if, based on current pe  riod results, the shares would not be issuable if the end of the reporting period were the end of the contingency period. If the performance condition were to become satisfied based on actual financial results and the    

18  

performance awards would have a diluti  ve impact on EPS, the performance awards included in the diluted EPS calculation would be in the range of   0.3   million to   1.2   million shares depending on the level of achievement.  

10  .          EMPLOYEE PENSION   AND   POSTRETIREMENT PLANS  
                 
               The components of the net periodic benefit cost for both the pension and postretirement plans for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:   
                 
              Pension Benefits:  

Other Postretirement Benefits:  

The Company was required to remeasure U.S. and Switzerland pension and other postretirement plan assets and obligations due to the curtailments.  The basis for the remeasurements remained unchanged from prior periods and included upd  ating assumptions such as the discount rate and demographic data     and testing fair values of related plan assets. The remeasurements resulted in the recognition of $  26.4   million in actuarial net losses.  
                 
              The pension and other postre  tirement curtailment and termination benefit net losses of $  0.9   million are related to the 2016 Restructuring Actions in the U.S. and Switzerland.  Curtailment and termination benefit gains are recognized when the event occurs   whereas curtailment and termination benefit losses are recognized when the obligation is probable and estimable.  
                 
              For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , $  6.0   million of contributions have been made to the Company s pension and postretirement plans. The Company currently expects to contribute approximately $  3   million to its pension and other postretirement   plans for the remainder of   2016  .  

11  .          DERIVATIVES   
                 
              Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities  
                 
              Lexmark s activities expose it to a variety of market risks,   including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company s risk management program seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market risks may have on its operating results.  
                 
              Lexmark maintains a foreign   currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings caused by volatility in currency exchange rates. The Company does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading pu  rposes nor does it hold or issue leveraged derivative instruments. Lexmark maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that may, from time to time use derivative instruments to minimize significant, unanticipated earnings    

19  

fluctuations caused by int  erest rate volatility. By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Lexmark manages exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering   into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to fully perform under the terms of the agreement. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in currency ex  change rates or interest rates. The Company manages exposure to market risk associated with interest rate and foreign exchange contracts by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.  
                 
              Fair   Value Hedges  
                 
              Lexmark uses fair value hedges to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility may have on its operating results. Fair value hedges are hedges of recognized assets or liabilities. Lexmark enters into forward exchange contract  s to hedge accounts receivable, accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities. The forward contracts used in this program generally mature in three months or less, consistent with the underlying asset or liability. Foreign exchange forward con  tracts may be used as fair value hedges in situations where derivative instruments expose earnings to further changes in exchange rates.   
                 
              Cash Flow Hedges  
                 
              Cash flow hedges are hedges of forecasted transactions or of the variability of cash flows to be re  ceived or paid related to a recognized asset or liability. Lexmark regularly enters into foreign exchange options generally expiring approximately twelve months from execution as hedges of anticipated sales that are denominated in foreign currencies. These   contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.   
                 
              Accounting for Derivatives and Hedging Activities  
                 
              All derivatives are recogniz  ed in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position at their fair value. Fair values for Lexmark s derivative financial instruments are based on pricing models or formulas using current market data, or where applicable, quoted market prices.   On the date the derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge, based upon the nature of the underlying hedged item. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective a  s   and that is designated and qualifies as   a fair value hedge, along with the loss or gain on the hedged asset or liability are recorded in current period earnings in   Cost of revenue   or   Other expense (income), net   on the Consolidated Condensed Statement  s of Earnings. Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as       and that is designated and qualifies as       a cash flow hedge of a forecasted sale is recorded in     Accumulated other comprehensive loss     on the Consolidated Condensed Statem  ents of Financial Position, until the underlying transactions occur, at which time the loss or gain on the derivative is recorded in current period earnings in   Revenue   on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings.   Cash flows of d  erivatives qualifyi  ng as hedges are included in the same section of the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows as the   cash flows of the   underlying assets and liabilities being hedged.  
                 
              Lexmark formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedg  ed items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge items. This process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value and cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance shee  t or to forecasted transactions, as appropriate. The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair val  ue or cash flows of hedged items. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively, as discussed below.  
                 
              Lexmark discont  inues hedge accounting prospectively when (1) it is determined that a derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item, (2) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or (3) the deriv  ative is discontinued as a hedge instrument, because it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the deriv  ative will continue to be carried on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position at its fair value. When hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur, the derivative will continue to b  e carried on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position at its fair value, and gains and losses that were recorded in   Accumulated other comprehensive loss   are recognized immediately in earnings.     In all other situations in which hedge accou  nting is discontinued, the derivative will be carried at its fair value on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position, with changes in its fair value recognized in current period earnings.

Fair Value Hedges  
                 
               Net outstanding notional amount of derivative positions as of   September 30, 2016   is in the table that follows. These positions were driven by fair value hedges of recognized assets and liabilities primarily denomin  ated in the currencies below:   

As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , the Company had the following net derivative assets (liabilities) recorded at fair value in   Prepaid expenses and other current   assets (Accrued liabilities)   on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position:   

(1) Amounts presented in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position  
              (2) Amounts not offset in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Posi  tion  
                   
               The Company had the following (gains) and losses related to derivative instruments qualifying and designated as hedging instruments in fair value hedges and related hedged items recorded on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings:   

* Gains and losses recorded in   Cost of revenue   are included in Product on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earni  ngs  

21  

Cash Flow Hedges  
                 
              The Company s cash flow hedging contracts are not subject to master netting agreements or other terms under U.S. GAAP that allow net presentation in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position. The total notional amounts as of   September 30, 2016   of the Company s foreign exchange options designated as cash flow hedges of anticipated Euro and British pound denominated sales were $  575.9   million and $  24.2   million, respectively.    As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , the Company had the following gross derivative assets (liabilities) recorded at fair value in   Prepaid ex  penses and other current assets (Accrued liabilities)   on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position for its cash flow hedges:   

The Company had the following gains and (losses) related to derivative instruments qualifying and designated as cash flow hedging instruments and related hedged items recorded on the Consolidated Condensed Statements   of Comprehensive Earnings:   

The Company did not discontinue hedge accounting for any derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges during the   three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company discontinued hedge accounting for certain   derivative instruments previously designated as cash flow hedges because it was probable that the underlying forecasted transaction would not occur.   As a result, gains of $  0.9   million were reclassified into earnings during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , and recognized as a component of     Other expense (income), net     on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings.    No such amounts we  re reclassified into earnings during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
                 
              As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  ,   deferred net (losses) gains on derivative instruments recorded in     Accumulated other comprehensive loss   were $  (0.3)   million and $  11.0   million respectively, pre-tax. If realized,   all amounts as of   September 30, 2016     will be reclassified into earnings during the next 12 months. Ineffective portions of hedges are immediately recognized in current period earnings. There were no material gains or losses related to   the ineffective portion of hedges recognized in     the   three and nine   months ended   September 30,     2016   or   2015  .

12  .           FAIR VALUE  
                 
              General  
                 
              The accounting guidance for fair value measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ), and   requires disclosures about fair value measurements. The guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. As part   of the framework for measuring fair value, the guidance establishes a hierarchy of inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the mo  st observable inputs be used when available.  

22  

Fair Value Hierarchy  
                 
              The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are:  

<li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.8pt; text-indent:-10.8pt; text-align:justify; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; list-style-position:inside; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       Level 1   Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability   to access at the measurement date;  

<li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.8pt; text-indent:-10.8pt; text-align:justify; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; list-style-position:inside; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       Level 2   Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and  

<li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 28.8pt; text-indent:-10.8pt; text-align:justify; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; list-style-position:inside; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       Level 3   Unobservable inputs used in valuations in which there is little   market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date.  

Fair value measurements of assets and liabilities are assigned a level within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measur  ement in its entirety.  
                 
               Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis   

(1) Included in   Cash and cash equivalents   on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position.  
              (2) Foreign currency derivative ass  ets and foreign currency derivative liabilities are included in   Prepaid expenses and other current assets   and   Accrued liabilities  , respectively, on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position. Refer to Note   11   for   disclosure of derivative assets and liabilities on a gross basis.    
                 
               The Company s policy is to consider all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the Company s date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The amortized   cost of these investments closely approximates fair value in accordance with the Company s policy regarding cash equivalents. Fair value of these instruments is readily determinable using the methods described below for money market funds.   
                 
              Transfers  
                 
               In d  etermining where measurements lie in the fair value hierarchy, the Company uses default assumptions regarding the general characteristics of the financial instrument as the starting point. The Company then adjusts the level assigned to the fair value measu  rement for financial instruments held at the end of the reporting period, as necessary, based on the weight of the evidence obtained by the Company. Except for the levels assigned to its pension plan assets, which are reviewed annually, the Company reviews   the levels assigned to its fair value measurements on a quarterly basis and recognizes transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the beginning of the quarter in which the transfer occurs.    There were no transfers between levels of the fair   value hierarchy during the first   nine months   of   2016   or   2015  .  
                 
              Valuation Techniques  
                 
              Money Market Funds   
                 
              The money market funds in which the Company is invested are   considered cash equivalents and are generally highly liquid investments. Money market funds are valued at the per share (unit) published as the basis for current transactions.  
                 
              Derivatives  
                 
              The Company employs foreign currency and interest rate risk management strategies that periodically utilize derivative instruments to protect its interests from unanticipated fluctuations in earnings and cash flows caused by volatility in currency exchange   rates and interest rates. Fair values for the Company s derivative financial instruments are based on pricing models or formulas using current market data. Variables used in the calculations include forward points, spot rates, volatility assumptions and b  enchmark interest rates at the time of valuation, as well as the frequency of payments to and from counterparties and effective and termination dates. The Company believes there is minimal risk of nonperformance. At   S  eptember 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , all of the Company s    

23  

derivative instruments were designated as Level 2 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note   11   of the Notes to Consolidated   Condensed Financial Statements for more information on the Company s derivatives.  
                 
              Senior Notes  
                 
              The Company s outstanding senior notes consist of $  300     million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes issued in a public debt offering   in May 2008 and due on June 1, 2018 (the  2018 senior notes ) and $  400   million of fixed rate senior unsecured notes issued in a public debt offering completed in March 2013 and due on March 15, 2020 (the  2020 senior notes ).   
                 
              The fair values shown in the table below are based on the prices at which the bonds have recently traded in the market as well as the overall market conditions on the date of valuation, stated coupon rates, the number of coupon payments each year and the m  aturity dates. The fair value of the debt is not recorded on the Company s Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position and is therefore excluded from the fair value table above. This fair value measurement is classified as Level 2 within the fa  ir value hierarchy. Carrying values shown in the table below are net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs.  

Refer to Note   4   of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for more information on the senior notes.  
                 
              Contingent Consideration   
                 
              In the first quarter of 2016 the Company settled the contingent consideration liability for the amount at which   it had been accrued as of December 31, 2015.  
                 
              Other Financial Instruments  
                 
              The fair values of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and accounts payable approximate their carrying values due to the relatively short-term nature of the instruments. Si  nce the borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the accounts receivable program utilize variable interest rate setting mechanisms such as one-month LIBOR, the fair value of these borrowings is deemed to approximate the carrying values. Refer to   Note   4   of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for more information on the accounts receivable and revolving credit facilities.  
                 
              Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Subsequent to   Initial Recognition  
                 
              There were no material fair value adjustments to assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to initial recognition during the first   nine   months of   2016   or   2015  .    

13  .          SEGMENT DATA   
                 
               Lexmark operates in the office imaging     and enterprise content and     business process management     markets. The Company is managed along     two   operating   segments: ISS and Enterprise Software.   
                 
              ISS offers a broad portfolio of monochrome and color laser printers and laser multifunction products as well as a wide range of supplies and services covering its p  rinting products and technology solutions.  
                 
              Enterprise Software offers an integrated suite of   enterprise content management (   ECM   )  ,   business process management (   BPM   )  ,   document output management (   DOM   )  /  customer communications management (   CCM   )   that inc  ludes case management, electronic signature, process analytics, information and application integration, intelligent content capture and data extraction, enterprise search software and medical imaging   vendor neutral archive (   VNA   )   software products and so  lutions.   The Company acquired Claron on January 2, 2015 and Kofax on May 21, 2015.   These acquisitions further expanded and strengthened the solutions available in the Enterprise Software segment.  
                 
              The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based     on revenue and operating income   and does not include segment assets or non-operating income/expense items for management reporting purposes. Segment operating (loss) income includes: selling, general and administrative; research and development; restructu  ring and related charges; and other expenses, certain of which are allocated to the respective segments based on internal measures and may not be indicative of amounts that would be incurred on a    

24  

stand-alone basis or may not be indicative of results of oth  er enterprises in similar businesses. All other operating (loss) income includes significant expenses that are managed outside of the reporting segments. These unallocated costs include such items     as information technology expenses, certain occupancy costs  ,     certain pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs,     stock-based compensation and certain other corporate and regional general and administrative expenses such as finance, legal and human resources. Acquisition-related costs and integration expen  ses are also included primarily in All other.    
                 
              The following table includes information about the Company s reportable segments:

              Guarantees and Indemnifications  
                 
              In the   ordinary course of business, the Company may provide performance guarantees to certain customers pursuant to which Lexmark has guaranteed the performance obligation of third parties. Some of those agreements may be backed by bank guarantees provided by the   third parties. In general, Lexmark would be obligated to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee. The Company believes the likelihood of having to perform under a guarantee is rem  ote.  
                 
              In most transactions with customers of the Company s products, software, services or solutions, including resellers, the Company enters into contractual arrangements under which the Company may agree to indemnify the customer from certain events as d  efined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to patent or copyright infringement. These indemnities do not always include limits on the claims, provided the claim is made pursuant to the procedures re  quired in the contract. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.  

25  

Contingencies  
                 
              The Company is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of intelle  ctual property, commercial, employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, various governmental authorities have from time to time initiated inquiries and investigations, some of which ar  e ongoing. The Company intends to continue to cooperate fully with those governmental authorities in these matters.  
                 
              Pursuant to the accounting guidance for contingencies, the Company regularly evaluates the probability of a potential loss of its material   litigation, claims or assessments to determine whether a liability has been incurred and whether it is probable that one or more future events will occur confirming the loss. If a potential loss is determined by the Company to be probable, and the amount o  f the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company establishes an accrual for the litigation, claim or assessment. If it is determined that a potential loss for the litigation, claim or assessment is less than probable, the Company assesses whether a pote  ntial loss is reasonably possible, and will disclose an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss; provided, however, if a reasonable estimate cannot be made, the Company will provide disclosure to that effect. On at least a quarterly basis, managemen  t confers with outside counsel to evaluate all current litigation, claims or assessments in which the Company is involved. Management then meets internally to evaluate all of the Company s current litigation, claims or assessments. During these meetings, m  anagement discusses all existing and new matters, including, but not limited to, (i)     the nature of the proceeding; (ii)     the status of each proceeding; (iii)     the opinions of legal counsel and other advisors related to each proceeding; (iv)     the Company s exp  erience or experience of other entities in similar proceedings; (v)     the damages sought for each proceeding; (vi)     whether the damages are unsupported and/or exaggerated;     (vii)     substantive rulings by the court; (viii)     information gleaned through settlement d  iscussions; (ix)     whether there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions; (x)     whether there are significant factual issues to be resolved; and/or (xi)     whether the matters involve novel legal issues or unsettled legal theories. At these   meetings, management concludes whether accruals are required for each matter because a potential loss is determined to be probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated; whether an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss can be made fo  r matters in which a potential loss is not probable, but reasonably possible; or whether a reasonable estimate cannot be made for a matter.  
                 
              Litigation is inherently unpredictable and may result in adverse rulings or decisions. In the event that any one or   more of these litigation matters, claims or assessments result in a substantial judgment against, or settlement by, the Company, the resulting liability could also have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, cash flows and results of oper  ations.  
                 
              Legal Proceedings  
                 
              Lexmark v. Static Control Components, Inc.  
                 
              On December 30, 2002 ( 02 action ) and March     16, 2004 ( 04 action ), the Company filed claims against Static Control Components, Inc. ( SCC ) in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern   District of Kentucky (the  District Court ) alleging violation of the Company s intellectual property and state law rights. SCC filed counterclaims against the Company in the District Court alleging that the Company engaged in anti-competitive and monopol  istic conduct and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Sherman Act, the Lanham Act and state laws. SCC has stated in its legal documents that it is seeking approximately   $  17.8     million to $  19.5     million in damages for the Company s alleged anticompetitive conduct and approximately $  1   billion   for Lexmark s alleged violation of the Lanham Act. SCC is also seeking treble damages, attorney fees, costs and in  junctive relief. On September 28, 2006, the District Court dismissed the counterclaims filed by SCC that alleged the Company engaged in anti-competitive and monopolistic conduct and unfair and deceptive trade practices in violation of the Sherman Act, the   Lanham Act and state laws. On June 20, 2007, the District Court Judge ruled that SCC directly infringed one of Lexmark s patents-in-suit. On June 22, 2007, the jury returned a verdict that SCC did not induce infringement of Lexmark s patents-in-suit.  
                 
              Appe  al briefs for the 02 and 04 actions were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ( Sixth Circuit ) by SCC and the Company. In a decision dated August 29, 2012, the Sixth Circuit upheld the jury s decision that SCC did not induce patent i  nfringement and the District Court s dismissal of SCC s federal antitrust claims. The procedural dismissal of Static Control s Lanham Act claim and state law unfair competition claims by the District Court were reversed and remanded to the District Court.   A writ of certiorari was requested by the Company with the U.S. Supreme Court over the Sixth Circuit s decision regarding the Lanham Act.   On June 3, 2013, the Company was notified that the U.S. Supreme Court granted the Company s writ of certiorari. The U.  S. Supreme Court issued its opinion on March 25, 2014 affirming the judgment of the Sixth Circuit. The case has been remanded to the District Court for further proceedings on SCC s   Lanham Act and state law unfair competition claims against the Company  .   
                 
              T  he Company has not established an accrual for the SCC litigation, because it has not determined that a loss with respect to such litigation is probable. Although there is a reasonable possibility of a potential loss with respect to the SCC litigation, with   SCC s Lanham Act and state law claims being dismissed in the early stages of the litigation and now remanded to the District Court, the Company does not believe a reasonable estimate of the range of possible loss is currently possible in view of the uncer  tainty regarding the amount of damages, if any, that could be awarded in this matter.

Philippines Donor Tax  
                 
              In the second quarter of 2013, as part of the Company s sale of inkjet-related technology and assets,   100%   of the shares o  f the legal entity owning the inkjet manufacturing facility in Cebu, Philippines were sold. The Philippines internal revenue bureau ( BIR ) subsequently assessed approximately $  6.5   million of Philippines donor tax related to th  is share sale transaction. Lexmark has submitted additional tax declarations to the BIR to have this amount reduced to less than $  1   million, which is currently pending.  In addition to challenging the amount of donor   tax that may be owed, Lexmark filed a request for ruling on exemption for donor tax which was denied by the BIR. During the third quarter of 2015, Lexmark filed a request to review the BIR s decision with the Philippines Secretary of Finance. This decision   is currently pending.  Lexmark continues to reserve the right to challenge these rulings in Philippine courts.  
                 
              Based on these developments, Lexmark continues to believe that a minimum of $  0.5   million is probable to resolve th  is matter. Depending on the interpretation by the BIR, Philippine Secretary of Finance and/or Philippine courts, Lexmark may be required to pay the most recent BIR calculated amount of approximately $  6.5   million plus accrued in  terest. Because the Company continues to believe that at this stage of the dispute that no single amount of the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the Company has accrued $  0.5   million, which represents the low en  d of the range.  
                 
              Copyright Fees  
                 
              Certain countries (primarily in Europe) and/or collecting societies representing copyright owners  interests have taken action to impose fees on devices (such as scanners, printers and multifunction devices) alleging the co  pyright owners are entitled to compensation because these devices enable reproducing copyrighted content. Other countries are also considering imposing fees on certain devices. The amount of fees, if imposed, would depend on the number of products sold and   the amounts of the fee on each product, which will vary by product and by country.  
                 
              Reprobel, a collection society with the authority to collect and distribute the remuneration for reprography to Belgian copyright holders, commenced legal proceedings   against Lexmark Belgium in March of 2010 before the Civil Court of First Instance of Brussels, Belgium to collect copyright levies calculated based on the generally higher copying speed when multi-function devices are operated in draft print mode rather th  an when operated in normal print mode.  The Company defended the action by claiming that no copyright levies are payable on sales of multi-function devices in Belgium or, alternatively, that copyright levies payable on such multi-function devices must be l  ower.  On June 12, 2014, the Court of First Instance rejected Reprobel s claim for copyright levies from the Company, based primarily on a finding that the Belgian reprography legislation violated European Union law. Further, in light of the above, the Cou  rt also decided that it must acknowledge Lexmark s reservation of right with respect to a possible reimbursement of the levies previously paid to Reprobel. Reprobel has appealed that court decision to the Courts of Appeal in Brussels.  
                 
              In a related industr  y case, on November 12, 2015 the Court of Justice of the European Union ( CJEU )     declared the Belgian reprography levy collection system incompatible with EU law, thereby further strengthening Lexmark s case (HP Be  lgium vs. Reprobel, C-572/13). As a result   of these significant legal decisions,   Lexmark reversed its accrual for this matter     i  n the fourth quarter of 2015   b  ecause it has determined that a loss with respect to such litigation is no longer probable given the decision of the Civil Court of First Ins  tance of Brussels in favor of the Company and the CJEU s November decision declaring the Belgian copyright levy system incompatible with European Union law.  
                 
              Other Litigation  
                 
              There are various other lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings involvi  ng the Company that are currently pending. The Company has determined that although a potential loss is reasonably possible for certain matters, that for such matters in which it is possible to estimate a loss or range of loss, the estimate of the loss or   estimate of the range of loss are not material to the Company s consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position.  

15  .          RECENT   ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   
                 
              Accounting Standards Updates Recently Issued But Not Yet Effective  
                 
              In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 is a   new comprehensive standard for revenue recognition that is based on the core principle that revenue be recognized in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expe  cts to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Under the new standard, a good or service is transferred to the customer when (or as) the customer obtains control of the good or service, which differs from the risk and rewards approach under cu  rrent guidance. The new standard provides guidance for transactions that were not previously addressed    

27  

comprehensively, including service revenue and contract modifications, eliminates the software industry revenue recognition guidance, and requires enhanc  ed disclosures about revenue.  
                 
              ASU 2014-09 may be adopted through either retrospective application to all periods presented in the financial statements or through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the effective date. In August 2015, th  e FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date   to provide a one year delay in the effective date of ASU 2014-09. The effective date of the new guidance for the Compan  y is now January 1, 2018; however, early application is permitted for the Company s 2017 fiscal year. The FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Re  porting Revenue Gross versus Net),   Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,   and   Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Custo  mers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   to help reduce complexity and clarify certain aspects of ASU 2014-09. These ASUs have the same effective date and transition requirements as described above.  
                 
              The Company is in the proces  s of evaluating a sample of its contracts with customers under the new standard and cannot currently estimate the financial statement impact of adoption. The Company hopes to complete its accounting policy assessment by year-end 2016.  
                 
              Areas of potential   change for the Company include, but are not limited to:

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases   (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 requires that lessees recognize all leases (other than leases with a term of twelve months or less) on the balance sheet as lease liabilities, based upon the present value of the lease payments, with corresponding r  ight of use assets. ASU 2016-02 also makes targeted changes to other aspects of current guidance, including identifying a lease and lease classification criteria as well as the lessor accounting model, including guidance on separating components of a contr  act and consideration in the contract. The amendments in ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and will require modified retrospective application as of the beginning of the earliest period presented in the financial statements.   Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance.  
                 
              In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounti  ng   ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 requires that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement rather than stockholders  equity and may increase volatility in net earnings. The tax effects   of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur under the new guidance. Under ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies will no longer be included in the assumed proceeds under the tr  easury stock method for calculating diluted earnings per share and excess tax benefits will be included in the determination of operating cash flows and no longer classified as a financing inflow on the statement of cash flows. Furthermore, the Company wil  l be permitted to account for forfeitures as they occur or continue its practice of estimating forfeitures as required under current guidance. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017; however, early adoption is permitted. The transition   requirements for ASU 2016-09 vary by topic. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance.  
                 
              In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Finan  cial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss approach under current guidance with an expected loss model for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. This change eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold und  er current guidance and requires that an entity estimate its lifetime expected credit loss and record the full amount in net earnings with a corresponding allowance upon initial recognition of a financial asset. The estimate should consider historical info  rmation, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts and must be updated through net earnings    

28  

each reporting period. ASU 2016-13 also makes targeted changes to current accounting guidance for determining credit losses for available-for-sal  e debt securities, including requiring certain credit-related losses to be presented as an allowance rather than as a direct reduction of amortized cost and permitting improvements to such estimated credit losses to be recognized immediately in net earning  s. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2020 and will require a cumulative effect adjust to retained earnings (with certain exceptions) as of this date. Early application is permitted for the Company as of January 1  , 2019. The Company presently has trade receivables and sales-type lease receivables and has historically held available-for-sale debt securities, all of which are in scope of ASU 2016-13. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance.  
                 
              In August 2016,   the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on eight cash flow issues, including debt prepayment or   debt extinguishment costs. Although the Company does not anticipate a material impact to its statement of cash flows, the ASU requires that cash payments related to debt prepayments or debt extinguishments, excluding accrued interest, be classified as a fi  nancing activity rather than an operating activity even when the effects enter into the determination of net income. Thus, debt extinguishments may be presented differently than the Company s debt extinguishment that occurred in 2013. The amendments in ASU   2016-15 will be effective on January 1, 2018 and must be applied retrospectively. Early application is permitted. The Company   is currently evaluating   this guidance.  
                 
              In October 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-16,   Income Taxes (T  opic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory   ( ASU 2016-16 ). ASU 2016-16 requires the recognition of current and deferred income taxes resulting from an intra-entity transfer of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs. The   ASU will continue to prohibit the recognition of income tax consequences for intra-entity transfers of inventory until the asset is sold to an outside party consistent with current guidance. The amendments in ASU 2016-16 will be effective on January 1, 20  18 and must be applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance.  
                 
              The FASB is  sued other accounting guidance during the period that is not applicable to the Company s financial statements and, therefore, is not discussed above.      

16  .          SUBSEQUENT   EVENTS   
                 
              On   October 28, 2016  , the Company s Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of $  0.36   per share of Class A Common Stock. The dividend is payable   December 16, 2016   to stockholders of record on   December 2, 2016  . In the event the closing of the acquisition of Lexmark by the Consortium occurs prior to the record date, no quarterly cash dividen  d will be paid. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement with the Consortium, any regular quarterly dividends must be declared and paid with usual record and payment dates in accordance with past dividend practice.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  
                 
              Lexm  ark s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company s consolidated condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.   Th  e preparation of consolidated condensed financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as disclosures regarding contingencies.   Lexmark bases it  s estimates on historical experience, market conditions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable   under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities   that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  

30  

An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it   requires   an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could mater  ially i  mpact the financial statements.  
                 
              Except for the item discussed below, m  anagement believes that there have been no   significant   changes during   2016   to the items that were disclosed as critical accounting policies and estimate  s   with  in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   of   the Company s   2015     Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
                 
              Goodwill and Intangible Assets  
                 
              Goodwill assigned to the ISS and Enterprise   Software reporting units as of September 30, 2016 was $  17.1   million and $  1,305.9   million, respectively.   In the third quarter of 2016 the Company determined that it was more  -  likely  -than-not that the Comp  any would be sold as part of the pending merger with the Consortium, and consequently tested goodwill for impairment as of September 30, 2016. T  he Company performed a qualitative assess  ment for the ISS reporting unit. The fair value of the ISS reporting un  it was substantially in excess of its carrying value on this date. T  he Company performed a quantitative assessment   for the Enterprise Software reporting unit   based on multiples developed from prices paid in observed market transactions and public company t  rading multiples.     The fair value of the Enterprise Software reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value on this date. The carrying value of the Enterprise Software reporting unit includes goodwill and intangible assets from recently acquired busines  ses such as Kofax,   that were recently recorded at fair value based on   business operating plans and macroeconomic conditions   at the time of acquisition. Consequently, the Enterprise Software reporting unit is   more susceptible   to potential   impairment charge  s   resulting from adverse changes  .     The Enterprise Software reporting unit s operating results fell short   of expectation during the first   nine months     of     2016  ; however, the Company s long-term pr  ojected opera  ting results remain unchanged.   If the Company is not able to achieve the projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible, which would negatively impact the Company s earnings.

In July 2015 and February 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions   designed to increase profitability and operational efficiency  .     In 2012, the Company announced rest  ructuring actions including exiting the development and manufacturing of its remaining inkjet hardware.   As previously reported, i  n the second quarter of 2013, the Company sold   its   inkjet-related technology and assets.

Operating Results Summary  
                 
              The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and Notes thereto. The following t  able summarizes the results of the Company s operations for the     three and nine     months ended   September 30, 2016     and     2015  :  

Current Quarter  
                 
              For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , total Lexmark revenue   declined     1  % YTY, driven by   an unfavorable YTY currency impact of   2  % and   an unfavorable YTY   impact of   2  % due to the Company s exit of inkjet technology. These factors were partially offset by a positive impact of     1% from laser supplies revenue growth and     1  % f  rom Enterprise Software revenue growth  .  

32  

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , operating income   increased   $  57.5   million or     266  % YTY primarily due to   lower   operating expense  s   driven by   a decrease of $20.4 million of   acquisition  , strategic alternatives, and divestiture  -related adjustments   and overall expense   management.  
                 
              Net earnings for the three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     $  33.5   million or   220  %   from   the pr  ior year,   due to     an increase in operating income and the impact of a lower effective tax rate  .   Net earnings for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   i  ncluded   $  45.6     million   of pre-t  ax acquisition   and   strategic alternatives  -related adjustments,   $  0.5   million     of   pre-tax restructuring   charges   and project costs     and   $  1.5     million   in     pre-tax remediation-related charges  .   Net earnings for the three months ended   September 30, 2015     included $  81.5   mi  llion   of pre-tax acquisition   and divestiture  -related adjustments  ,   $  0.9   mi  llion     of pre-tax restructuring charges and project costs   and $  3.2   million in     pre-tax remediation-related charges.  
                 
              Year-to-Date  
                 
              For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , total Lexmark revenue   declined     3  % YTY, driven by   an unfavorable YTY currency impact of 4% and   an unfavorable YTY   impact of 3% due to the Company s exit of inkjet   technology. These factors were partially offset by a positive impact of   3  % from Enterprise Software revenue   growth  , reflecting a favorable impact of   4  % due to the   acquisition of Kofax  .  
                 
              For the   nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , operating income     increased   $  21.8   million or   1,453  %   YTY     primar  ily     due     to   lower operating expenses   of $60.6 million,   p  artially offset   by a decrease in gross profit of $38.8 million compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in gross profit was driven by the   unfavorable impact from a     partial reversal of     an     accru  ed contingency of $23.5 million     in the comparative period and YTY lower acquisition-related adjustments of $14.8 million  . The lower operating expenses were driven by a decrease in restructuring charges and project costs of $50.0 million, a decrease in acqu  isition, strategic alternatives,     and divestiture-related adjustments of $32.9 million and overall expense management. This was partially offset by an increase in the pension and other postretirement benefit plan actuarial net     loss of $20.2 million.  
                 
              Net ea  rnings for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     declined   $  26.8   million or   90  %     from     the prior year, primarily due     to   an   increase   in the Company s   reserve for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest   partially offset by an increase in operating income.     Net earnings for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     included     $  150.2   million of   pre-tax acquisition   and   strategic alternatives  -related adjustments  ,     a pension and other     postreti  rement benefit plan actuarial net     loss     of $  26.4   million, $  (10.8)     million     of pre-tax restructuring     reversals and project costs,   and   $  10.4     million     in     remediation-related c  harges. Net earnings for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2015     included $  197.9     million     of pre-tax acquisition and divestiture-related   adjustments,     $  40.0     million of pre-tax restructuring charges and project costs, a pension and other postretirement benefit plan actuarial net     loss of $  0.3   million and $  3.2   million     in     remediation-related charges  .  
                 
              The Company uses the term  acquisition,   strategic     alternatives, and   divestiture-related adjustments  for purchase accounting adjustments, incremental acquisition and integration costs related to acquisitions, cost  s related to the strategic alternatives process  , and   costs related to the sale of inkjet-related technology and assets. The Company uses the term  project costs  for incremental charges related to the execution of its restructuring plans. The Company uses   the term  remediation-related charges  for professional fees associated with analysis and remediation of the Company s previously disclosed material weakness in internal controls over income tax accounting.  
                 
              Revenue  
                 
              The following table provides a breakdow  n of the Company s revenue by segment:  

ISS  
                 
              For the three months ended   September   30, 2016  , ISS revenue   declined     2  % compared   to the same period in   2015  ,   which reflected   unfavorable currency and inkjet exit impacts of approximately   3  % and 3%, respectively.     Large workgroup laser hardware revenue, which represented about   85%   of total hardware revenue for the three months ended   September   30, 2016  , declined   5%   YTY   reflecting a decrease of 10% YTY in average unit revenue ( AUR ), driven by   unfavorable currency movements   and unfavorable product mix.   Units     increased by 5%, driven by higher sales volumes.     Small   workgroup laser hardware revenue, which for the three months ended    

33  

September 30, 2016   represented about 15% of total hardware revenue,   increased 5% YTY reflecting a 4% increase in units, driven by higher sales volumes and a 1% increase in AUR YTY reflecting a favorable product mix.  
                 
              Supplies revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was down 1% compared to the same period in   2015, reflecting unfavorable currency and inkjet exit impacts of 3% and 4%, respectively.     These factors were partially offset by YTY growth of 2% in laser supplies revenue driven by higher sales volumes and YTY growth in MPS laser supplies revenue.   I  nkjet     exit supplies revenue   declined 56% YTY   due to ongoing and expected declines in the inkjet installed base as the Compan  y has exited inkjet technology.  
                 
              For the     nine     months ended   September 30, 2016  , ISS revenue     declined     7  % compared to the same period in     2015, including unfavorable currency and inkjet exit impacts of     approximately   4  % and 3%,     respectively.   Large workgroup laser hardware revenue, which represented     about 85%   of total hardware re  venue for the     nine     months ended     September 30  , 2016  , declined   11  % YTY reflecting a 3% decline in units,     primarily     driven by competitive pressures, and a 8% decline in AUR, reflecting unfavorable currency movements and an unfavorable product mix during 2016.   Small     workgroup laser hardware revenue, which for the     nine   months ended     September 30, 2016     represented     about 15% of total har  dware revenue, declined   8  % YTY due to a   9  %     decrease in units driven by competitive pressures. AUR increased 1% YTY reflecting a favorable product mix during 2016.   The   Company uses the term  large workgroup  to include departmental, large workgroup and medium workgroup lasers, which are typically at  tached directly to large workgroup networks, as well as dot matrix printers and options. The term  small workgroup  includes small workgroup lasers and personal lasers, which are attached to small workgroup networks and/or personal computers.   The Company u  ses the term  inkjet exit  to include consumer and business inkjet supplies.  
                 
              Supplies revenue for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     was down 6% compared to the same period in     2015, reflecting unfavorable currency and inkjet exit impacts of 4% and 4  %, respectively. Laser supplies revenue decreased 2% YTY primarily due to unfavorable currency impact of 4% partially offset by YTY growth in MPS laser supplies revenue.     Inkjet exit supplies revenue declined 57% YTY due to ongoing and expected declines in   the inkjet installed base as the Company has exited inkjet technology.  
                 
              Enterprise   Software  
                 
              For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenue for Enterprise Software   increased     5  % primarily   due to a     greater unfavorable impact of fair value adjustments recorded in purchase accounting during the comparative period   and   a YTY increase   in maintenance and support revenue.   This was partially offse  t by a YTY   decrease in license revenue due to higher than anticipated levels of   attrition   in the sales force   as a result of the strategic alternatives process   a  s well as an unfavorable currency impact of 1%  .  
                 
              For the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , revenue for Enterprise Software     increased     23  %     primarily driven by the acquisition of   Kofax in the second   quarter of 2015  .     The YTY increases in   license and maintenance and support revenue     reflected a favorable impact of 31% due to the acquisition of Kofax.   This was partially offset by a slight decrease in professional services revenue   due to higher than antic  ipated levels of   attrition   in the sales force   as a result of the strategic alternatives process   as well as   an unfavorable     currency impact of 1%.

              Revenue by   Geography  
                 
              The following table provides a breakdown of the Company s revenue   by geography:  

For the three months ended   September 30,   2016  , revenues in the United States   declined   slightly compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to   lower   laser   supplies revenue   and lower Enterprise Software revenue   as well as the negative impact of the Company s planned exit from inkjet technologies partially offset by   higher laser hardware revenue  . Revenues in EMEA   increased     slightly   com  pared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to   higher     l  aser supplies revenue. These factors were partially offset by   lower laser hardware revenue  ,   which reflected unfavorable currency impact  ,   the negative impact   of the Company s planned exit from inkjet technologies   and lower   Enterprise Software revenue. The YTY   decline   in revenues in other international regions was primarily due to lower laser supplies   and laser hardware   revenue   in Latin America and Asia Pacific, partially offset by growth in Enterprise Software revenue   in Asia Pacific  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , currency exchange rates had an unfavorable YTY i  mpact on total revenue of   2  %.

For the     nine     months ended     September   30, 201  6  , revenues in the United States     de  creased   slightly   compared to the same period in     201  5   primarily due to   lower   laser supplies revenue   as well as   the n  egative impact of the Company s   planned exit from inkjet technologies  , partially offset by     higher   services and   Enterprise Software   revenue  . Revenues     in EMEA     declined   slightly     compared     to the same period in     201  5     primarily due to lower laser hardware revenue,   which reflected unfavorable cu  rrency impact  ,   and the negative impact of the Company s planned exit from inkjet technologies. These factors were partially offset by growth in Enterprise Software revenue.   The     YTY     decline     in revenues in     other international regions was primarily     due to low  er laser hardware and   laser   supplies revenues in   Latin America and   Asia Pacific  ,   partially offset by growth in Enterprise Software revenue   in Asia Pacific  .     For the     nine     months ended     September   30, 201  6  , currency exchange rates had an unfavorable YTY impact   on total revenue of     4  %.  
                 
              Gross Profit  
                 
              The following table provides gross profit information:  

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , consolidated gross profit   increased     3  % and gross profit as a percentage of revenue   increased     1   percentage   point   compared to the same period in   2015  . Gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   versus the   same period in   2015     reflected   fa  vorable impacts of 2 percentage points for lower acquisition-related costs and 1 percentage point for supplies and services margins. These favorable impacts were partially offset by   a 1 percentage point impact for lower hardware margins,     reflecting an unfavorable impact for currency movements.   Gross profit for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   included $  19.6   million of pre-tax acquisition  -related adjustments  .   Gross profit for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   included   $  35.1   mi  llion of pre-tax acquisition-related adjustments.  
                 
              For   the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , consolidated gross profit   decreased     4  %   and gross profit as a   percentage of revenue     was flat compared to the same period in   2015  . Gross profit as a percentage of revenue for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016   versus the same period in     2015     reflected favorable impacts of 1 percentage point for lower acquisition-related costs, 1 percentage point for higher services margins and a 1 percentage point   mix impact. The mix impact reflected the benefit of a lower relative proportion of laser hardware revenue.   These favorable impacts were partially offset by unf  avorable impacts of   1 percentage points for hardware driven by   partial reversal of   an   accrued con  tingency   in the comparative period and a   negative impact of 2 percentage points for product margins, reflecting an unfavorable impact for currency movements. Gross profit     for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     included $  64.4   million of pre-tax acquisition-related adjustments and     a pension and other postretirement benefit plan actuarial net     loss     of $  6.0     million.   Gross profit for the nine months ended     September 30, 2015     included $  79.2     million of pre-tax acquisition-related adjustments, $  0.8     million of pre-tax restructuring charges, and     a pension and other po  stretirement benefit plan actuarial net     loss of $  0.1   million.

              Operating Expense  
                 
              The following table presents information regarding the Company s operating expenses during the periods indicated:  

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , total operating expense   decreased     14  % compared to the same period in   2015  . Re  search and development expenses for the three months ended   Septem  ber 30, 2016     decreased     16  % compared with the same period in   2015     driven by   expense reductions in ISS and Enterprise Software due to the Compan  y s restructuring actions  , overall expense management   and favorable currency movements  .   Selling  , general and administrative expenses for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     12  % compared with the same period in   2015  , reflecting lower acquisition-related adjustments, expense reductions in ISS and Enterprise Software due to the Company s   restructuring actions an  d favorable currency movements.    

35  

For the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , total operating expense     decreased     6  %     compared to the same period in     2015  . Research and development expenses for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     decreased     7  % compared with the same period in     2015     driven by   expense reductions in ISS and Enterprise   Software due to the Company s restructuring actions  , overall expense management   and favorable currency movements,   partially offset by   increases related to the acquisition of Kofax and the   impact of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan actuaria  l net loss. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     1  % compared with the same period in     2015  , reflecting     increases related to the acquisition of Kofax and the   impact of the pension and other postretirement benefit plan actuarial net loss  .   These factors were   partially offset by expense reductions in     ISS     and Enterprise Software     due to the Company s restructuring actions, overall expense management and favorable currency movements. Restructuring and related charges for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 d  ecreased $  50.8   million or   158  % compared with the same period in 2015, reflecting an accrual of $32.2 million established in the comparative period for the 2015 Restructuring Actions along with reversals of $(  18.6  ) million during the current period   primaril  y   due to the   higher than expected levels of attrition as a result of the strategic alternatives process as well as   the announced restructuring programs in 2015 and 2016  .   These higher levels of attrition reduced the expected termination benefits required re  sulting in the reversals.

              Operating Income (Loss)  
                 
              The following table provides operating income (loss) by segment:  

36  

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the   increase   in consolidated operating income from the same period in   2015   reflected   higher   operating   income   in   the   Enterprise Software   and   ISS segment  s  . All other reflected   lower acquisition and strategic alternatives  -related adjustments   and a   favora  ble currency   impact. The   higher   ISS operating income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   reflected lower operating   expenses due to cost reductions     from the announ  ced restructuring programs   and a favorable currency impact  , partially offset by   lower revenues primarily due to the unfavorable currency movements and the inkjet exit  .   The higher   Enterprise Software   operating income   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     w  as primarily driven by higher as well as lower acquisition  -related adjustments   and lower other operating expenses.  
                 
              For the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016  , the     increase     in consolidated operating income from the same period in     2015     reflected     lower     operating losses in Enterprise Softwa  re partially offset by lower     operating income in the ISS segment.     All other reflected     higher operating expenses related to     the acquisition of Kofax,   the unfavorable impact of the p  ension and other postretirement benefit plan actuarial net loss and higher r  emediation-related charges. These factors were     partially offset by   lower acquisition and strategic alternatives  -related adjustments  , lower restructuring charges and project costs and a   favorable currency   impact.   The     lower     ISS operating income for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     reflected   lower revenues primarily due to unfavorable currency movements, lower laser hardware and laser supplies revenues, and the ink  jet exit   as well as   the unfavorable impact on gross profit from a partial reversal of an accrued contingency in the comparative period, partially offset by lower operating expenses due to cost reductions and reversals of restructuring charges and project c  osts and a favorable currency impact.     The     lower     operating losses   in Enterprise Software for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     were driven     by   higher revenues primaril  y due to the acquisition of Kofax as well as slightly lower acquisition  -related adjustments   and lower restructuring-related charges. These factors were partially offset by higher other operating expenses primarily due to the acquisition of Kofax.

              Interest and Other  
                 
              The following table   provides interest and other information:  

37  

For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , total interest and other expense (income), net   de  creased compared to the same period in   2015   due to lower other expense during the period  .  
                 
              For the     nine     months     ended     September 30, 2016,     total interest and other (income) expense     increased     compared to the     same peri  od in     2015     reflecting higher interest expense for borrowings relat  ed to the acquisition of Kofax and reduced interest income due to lower cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balances.  
                 
              Provision for Income Taxes and Related Matters  
                 
              The   Provision for income taxes   for the   three   months ended   September   30, 2016 was     an   expense   of $  4.8   million or an effective tax rate of     20.6  %  , compared to   a benefit   of $  20.2   million or an effective tax rate of   57.1%   for the   three   months ended   September   30, 20  15.   The difference in these rates is primarily due to a shift in the expected geographic distribution of earnings for 2016 compared to 2015 and discrete items recorded in the respective periods.    Additionally, for the three months ended September 30, 2016,   the Company inc  reased income tax benefit by $  0.3   million in recognition of several discrete items, which primarily included a tax benefit related to the release of uncertain tax position accruals and provision-to-return adjustments for 2015 returns filed   during the quarter.  The three months ended September 30, 2015 included discrete items related to changes in estimates associated with filing 2014 tax returns, obtaining certification for certain state tax credits, and re-measuring certain non-functional c  urrency foreign deferred tax liabilities totaling a   benefit of   $  10.4   million.  
                 
              The   Provision for income taxes   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 was   an   expense   of $  40.5   million or an effective tax rate of   (252.2)%  , compared to   a   benefit   of $  3.5   m  illion or an effective tax rate of   10.5%   for the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015.   The difference in these rates is primarily due   to discrete items totaling $  39.7   million.   At reporting period end, the Company reassesses its uncertain tax positions. Dur  ing the second quarter of 2016, the Company determined it was no longer more likely than not that a previously recognized uncertain tax benefit will be sustained and therefore increased its reserve for uncertain tax positions and accrued interest by $34.9   million during the period ending June 30, 2016  .   The remaining portion of discrete items is primarily related to deferred tax expense associated with a change in the Switzerland applicable tax rate and provision-to-return adjustments for 2015 returns.     The n  ine months ended September 30, 2015 included discrete items related to changes in estimates associated with filing 2014 tax returns, obtaining certification for certain state tax credits, resolving certain tax uncertainties, and re-measuring certain non-fu  nctional currency foreign deferred tax liabilities totaling a benefit of $  7.9   million.  
                 
              It is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease in the next 12 months. Such changes could occur based on the   expiration of various statutes of limitations or the conclusion of ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions around the world. Accordingly, within the next 12 months, the Company estimates that its unrecognized tax benefits amount could decrease by an am  ount in the range of $  2.5   million to $  48.0   million.   The Company is unable to reasonably estimate a range of the possible increase in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that could occur within the next 12 months. However, any such increase is not expec  ted to be material to the Company.  
                 
              The Company s effective tax rate generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of   35%   as a result of U.S. state taxes on U.S. earnings and lower tax rates applicable to foreign earnings in most foreign jurisdict  ions in which the Company operates, most notably, Switzerland.  
                 
              Net   Earnings (Loss)   and   Earnings (Loss)   per Share  
                 
              The following table summarizes net   earnings (loss)   and basic and   diluted net earnings (loss) per share:  

Net     earnings   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased from the prior year primarily due to increased operating income and the impact   of a lower effective tax rate  . For   the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   the YTY increase in   basic   and   diluted   earnings   per share   was primarily due to higher earnings partially offset by higher weighted averag  e shares outstanding  .  
                 
              Net     loss for the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016     increased     from the prior year primarily due to an   increase   in the Company s     income tax provision driven by an increase in the   reserve for uncertain tax positions and accrued inter  est   partially offset by higher operating income.     For the     nine     months ended     September 30, 2016, the YTY     increase     in loss per share was primarily due to     a higher net loss.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND   PROJECT COSTS  
                 
              Summary of Restructuring Impacts  
                 
              The Company s   2016   financial results are impacted by its restructuring plans and related projects.   Project costs consist of additional charges related to the executi  on of the restructuring plans. These project costs are incremental to the Com  pany s normal operating charges   and are expensed as incurred, and include such items as compensation costs for overlap staffing, travel expenses, consulting costs and training cos  ts.  
                 
              Summary of Restructuring Actions  
                 
              2016 Restructuring Actions  
                 
              On February 23, 2016, the Company announced restructuring actions (the  2016  Restructuring Actions ) designed to increase profitability and operational efficiency primarily in its ISS Segm  ent. These restructuring actions are focused on optimizing the Company s ISS structure, primarily as a result of the continued strong U.S. dollar, and are also aligned with the previously announced strategic alternatives process.  
                 
              The 2016 Restructuring Ac  tions will impact about 550 positions worldwide through December 2016, with a portion of the positions being shifted to low-cost countries. The 2016 Restructuring Actions will result in total pre-tax charges, including project costs of approximately $46 mi  llion, with $33 million incurred to date, and the remainder to be incurred in 2016. The total cash costs of the 2016 Restructuring Actions will be approximately $43 million, of which $32 million has been incurred to date, and the remainder to be incurred i  n 2016. The cash outlays for the 2016 Restructuring Actions were $27 million through the third quarter 2016 and are anticipated to be approximately $16 million for the remainder of 2016.  
                 
              The 2016 Restructuring Actions will generate cash savings of approxi  mately $67 million in 2016 and ongoing annual savings of approximately $100 million in 2017, all of which will be cash savings. These ongoing savings will be split approximately 90% to   Operating expense   and approximately 10% to   Cost of revenue  . The Company   expects these actions to be complete by the end of 2016.  
                 
              2015 Restructuring Actions  
                 
              On July 21, 2015, the Company announced restructuring actions (the  2015 Restructuring Actions ) designed to increase profitability and operational efficiency. These Com  pany-wide restructuring actions are broad-based but capture the cost and expense synergies from the Kofax and ReadSoft acquisitions. Primary Company-wide impacts are general and administrative, marketing and development positions, as well as the consolidat  ion of regional facilities.  
                 
              The 2015 Restructuring Actions impact about 500 positions worldwide through December 2016,   with a portion of the positions being shifted to low-cost countries  . The 2015 Restructuring Actions will result in total pre-tax charges  , including project costs, of approximately $40 million, with $35 million incurred to date and approximately $5 million remaining to be incurred in 2016. The total cash costs of the 2015 Restructuring Actions will be approximately $39 million, with $33 mil  lion incurred to date and approximately $6 million remaining to be incurred in 2016. The cash outlays for the 2015 Restructuring Actions were $  30   million through the third quarter 2016 and are anticipated to be approximately $9 million for the remainder of   2016  .  
                 
              The 2015 Restructuring Actions will generate cash savings of approximately $55 million in 2016 and ongoing annual savings of approximately $65 million beginning in 2017, all of which will be cash savings. These ongoing savings will be split approximately 9  0% to   Operating expense   and approximately 10% to   Cost of revenue  . The Company expects these actions to be complete by the end of 2016.  
                 
              Other   Restructuring Actions  
                 
              As part of Lexmark s ongoing strategy to increase the focus of its talent and resources on higher usage     business platforms, the Company announced   various   restructuring actions   (the  Other   Restructuring Actions )   over the past several years  .   The Other Restr  ucturing Actions primarily include exiting the development and manufacturing of the Company s remaining inkjet hardware, with reductions primarily in the areas of inkjet-related manufacturing, research and development, supply   chain, marketing and sales  , as   well as other support functions. The Other Restructuring Actions are considered substantially completed and any remaining charges to be incurred from these actions are expected to be immaterial.    
                 
              Refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Fi  nancial Statements for a rollforward of the liability incurred for the 2016, 2015 and Other Restructuring Actions.

ACQUISITION  , STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES, AND DIVESTITURE-  RELATED ADJUSTMENTS  
                 
              P  re-tax acquisition   and strategic alternatives-  related adjustments affected the Company s financial results   as follows:  

Reductions in revenue and amortization of intangible assets were recognized primarily in the   Enterprise   Software reportable segment. Acquisition and integration costs   and costs rel  ated to the exploration of strategic alternatives were recognized primarily in All other.  
                 
              Acquisitions  
                 
              I  n connection with acquisitions, the Company   incurs costs and adjustments (referred to as  acquisition-related adjustments ) that affect t  he Company s   financial results.   These acquisition-related adjustments result from business combination accounting rules as well as expenses that would otherwise have not been incurred by the Company if acq  uisitions had not taken place.  
                 
              Reductions in revenue result   from business combination accounting rules when deferred revenue balances assumed as part of acquisitions are adjusted down to fair value. Fair value approximates the cost of fulfilling the service obligation, plus a reasonable profit margin. Subsequent to   acq  uisitions, the Company analyzes   the amount of amortized revenue that would have been recognized had the acquired company remained independent and had the deferred revenue balances not been adjusted to fair   value. Reductions in revenue   are reflected in   Revenue   presented on the Company s Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings. The Company expects   future   pre-tax reductions in revenue of   approximately $  2   million for the remainder of   2016  . For full year   2017  , the Company expects pre-tax reductions in revenue of approximately $  5   million.  
                 
              Due to business combination accounting rules, intangible assets are recognized as a result of acquisitions which were not prev  iously presented on the balance sheet of the acquired company. These intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology, customer relationships, trade names, in-  process research and development   and non-compete agreements. Subsequent to the acquisi  tion date, some of these intangible assets begin amortizing and represent an expense that would not have been recorded had the acquired company remained independent. The Company incurred the following on the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Earnings fo  r the amortization of intangible assets.  

The Company expects   future   pre-tax charges for the amortization of intangible assets of approximately $  28   million for the remainder of   2016  .   For full year   2017  , the Company expects   pre-tax   charges for the amortization of intangible assets of approximately $  100   m  illion  .     
                 
              In connection with its acquisitions, the Company incurs acquisition and integration expenses that would not have   been incurred otherwise. The acquisition costs include items such as investment banking fees, legal and accounting fees,   stock based compensation expense related to replacement awards issued to employees of acquired companies     and   costs of retention bonus p  rograms for the senior management of the acquired company. Integration costs may consist of informatio  n technology expenses including certain costs for software and systems to be implemented in acquired companies, consulting costs and travel expenses  . Inte  gration costs may also include   non-cash charges related to the abandonment of assets under construction by the Company that are determined to be duplicative of assets of the acquired company   and non-cash charges related to certain assets which are abandone  d as systems are integrated across the combined entity  .   Acquisition and integration expenses also include costs associated with the Company s    

43  

rebranding announced in April 2015 as well as related non-cash charges for the abandonment of certain obsolete mar  keting assets.   The costs are expensed as incurred, and can vary substantially in size from one period to the next.  
                 
              Acquisition and integration costs were recognized in     Selling, general and administrative   on the Company s Consolidated Condensed Statements   of Earnings. The Company expects pre-tax adjustments for acquisition and integration expenses of approximately $  13   million for the remainder of   2016   and approximately   $  15   million f  or   2017  .  
                 
              Strategic alternatives  
                 
              In 2015, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized the exploration of strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value. The Company has incurred costs related to the   exploration of strategic alternatives, and may incur additional costs  , which may be material,   such as investment banking fees, legal and accounting fees, employee travel expenses and compensation, and consulting costs.   Some of these costs will become payab  le upon a change in control of the Company and will require cash settlement. These costs   are incremen  tal to normal operating charges,   are expensed as incurred   and are reflected in   Selling, general and administrative   on the Company s Consolidated Condensed   Statements of Earnings  .   Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note   2   of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements and the definitive proxy statement filed on June 17, 2016 for more information on the   definitive merger agreement the   Company has entered into as a result of   the exploration of strategic alternatives process.  
                 
              Divestiture  
                 
              In connection with the sale of the Company s inkjet-related technology and assets, the Company incurred expenses that would not have been incurred oth  erwise. Divestiture-related costs consist of employee travel expenses and compensation, consulting costs, training costs and transition services including non-cash charges related to assets used in providing the transition services. These costs are increme  ntal to normal operating charges and are expensed as incurred. Divestiture-related costs were recognized in   Selling, general and administrative   on the Company s Consolidated   Condensed   Statements of Earnings. The Company expects future divestiture-related e  xpenses to be immaterial.  

FINANCIAL CONDITION  
                 
              Lexmark s financial position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31,   2015  , reflects the Company s investment   into the Enterprise Software segment with   negative   working   capital of $121.0 million and $142.2   million  , respectively. The increase in working capital is mainly driven by improved cash provided by operations  .   For the nin  e months ended September 30, 2016, cash flows provided by operations of $128.1 million was partially offset by plant and equipment purchases of approximately $57.1   million   and   net debt repayments   of $44.0 million.   
                 
              At   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  , the Company had senior note debt  , net of debt issuance costs,   of   $69  7.9   million and $697.3   million, respectively. The Company also had $  12.0   million outstanding under its U.S. trade r  eceivables facility and $  308.0   under its revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016  .   The Company had $  76.0   million outstanding under its U.S. trade receivables facility and $  288.0   under its revolving credit fa  cility   at   December 31,   2015  .   
                 
              The debt to capital ratio at   September 30, 2016   of 50% increased slightly compared to 49% at December 31, 2015  .   The debt to total capital ratio is calculated   by dividing the Company s outstanding debt by the sum of its outstanding debt and total stockholders  equity.  
                 
              The following table summarizes the results of the Company s Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

The Company s   primary source of liquidity has been cash generated by operations, which generally has been sufficient to allow the Company to fund its working capital needs and finance its capital expenditures.     Refer to the   Financing Activities   section which follows for   information regarding the Company s debt activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   Management

believes that cash provided by operations will be sufficient o  n a worldwide basis to meet operating and capital   needs  . However  , in the event that cash from operations is not sufficient, the Company has cash and cash equivalents and other potential sources of liquidity through   further   utilization of its   trade receivab  les financing program and committed revolving credit facilities  . The Company may   also   choose to use these sources of liquidity from time to time     to fund strategic acquisitions   and   dividends.  
                 
              As of   September 30, 2016  ,   the Company held $  117.7   m  illion in   Cash and cash equivalents  .   T  he Company s ability to fund operations from these balances could be limited   by   possible tax implications of moving proceeds across jurisdictions.   Of this amoun  t, approximately   $  104.9   million of   Cash and cash equivalents   w  as   held by foreign subsidiaries. The Company utilizes a variety of strategies   to deploy available   cash in   locations where it is needed.   The Company s intent is to pe  rmanently reinvest undistributed earnings of   its   foreign subsidiaries  ,   and   the Company s   current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate earnings   of foreign subsidiaries   to fund   U.S.   operations.     However, if   earnings of   foreign subsidiaries were neede  d to fund   U.S.   operations, the Company   may incur income and withholding   taxes to repatriate a large portion of the   earnings of foreign subsidiaries  .  
                 
              As of December   31,   2015  ,   the Company held $  158.3     million in   Cash and cash equivalents   and current   Marketable securities  . Of this amount, approximately $  107.9   million of   Cash and cash equivalents   and current   Marketable securities   w  as   held by foreign subsidiaries.  
                 
              A discussion of the Company s additional sources of liquidity is included in the   Financing   A  ctivities   section to follow.  
                 
              Operating Activities  
                 
              The $  123.4   million   increase   in cash flows   from operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   was driven by the following factors.  
                 
              The changes in   Accrued liabilities   and   Other assets     and liabilities  , collectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   2015  , resulted in a     favorable YTY impact of $  156.3   million  . This was primarily driven by higher net income tax payments in 2015, reversal of copyright fe  es in the comparative period a  nd lower cash expenditures for incentive compensation for the first   nine   months of 2016 versus 2015, offset by cash paid for employee terminatio  n severance benefits. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Condensed Finan  cial Statements for additional information on the Company s income taxes.   
                 
              Trade receivables   increased $  36.3   million and $22.2 million during in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015,   respectively. This $  14.1   million fluctuation year over year was prima  rily driven by timing of sales, a decrease in customers utilizing discount payment terms and successful collection initiatives durin  g the prior year.   
                 
              Contributions for pension and other postretirement benefit plans decreased YTY with contributions of $6.0 million and $9.3 million during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015  , respectively, resulting in a favorable YTY cash impact of $3.3 million.   This was primarily driven by favorable investment performance on plan assets.  
                 
              The activities above were offset by the following factors.  
                 
              Accounts payable   decreased $102.8 million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     compared to a decrease of $62.5 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015     which resulted in an unfavorable YTY impact of $40.3 million.   The YTY change in   Accounts payable   was primarily driven by timing of payments and decreased purchasing activity.  
                 
              Net earnings   decrease  d $  26.8   million for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .     Refer to the     Results of Operations     section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional details. The unfavorable YTY change in     Net earnings     inc  ludes increases in non-cash expenses of $30.8 million of pension and postretirement expenses related to   actuarial net losses   and curtailment   losses   and stock based compensation expenses of $12.8 million.   This is   offset by decreases in non-cash expenses of   depreciation   and   amortization   of $10.0 million   and deferred taxes of $10  .0   million.  
                 
              Cash Conversion Days  

Cash conversion days represent the number of days that elapse between the day the Company pays for materials and the day it collects cash from its customers. Cash conversion days are equal to the days of sales   outstanding plus days of inventory less days of payables.    

45  

The days of sales outstanding are calculated using the period-end   Trade receivables   balance, net of allowances, and the average daily revenue for the quarter.  
                 
              The days of inventory are calculated using the period-end net   Inventories   balance and the average daily cost of revenue for the quarter.  
                 
              The days of payables are calculated using the period-end   Accounts payable   balance and the average daily cost of revenu  e for the quarter.  
                 
              Please note that cash conversion days presented above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other registrants.   The cash conversion days in the table above may not foot due to rounding.  
                 
              Investing Activities  
                 
              The   $  412.7   million decrease in net cash flows used for investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   was driven by the YTY net decrease in cash flows used for business acquisitions of $  1,004.8   million and decreased   purchases of property, plant and equipment of $  27.0   million. This was partially offset by the YTY net decrease of $  625.4   million in cash flows provided by marketable securities investment activitie  s, which were fully liquidated in 2015.  
                 
              The Company s business acquisitions, marketable securities and capital expenditures are discussed below.  
                 
              Business Acquisitions  
                 
              During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not purchase any busi  nesses. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Kofax for approximately $1 billion. The Company funded the acquisition with its non-U.S. cash on hand and its existing credit facility programs. The addition   of Kofax enhanced the Company s industry-leading ECM and BPM offerings and strengthened the Company s portfolio of capture solutions in the market, ranging from Web portals and mobile devices to MFP s.  
                 
              During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the   Company also acquired substantially all the assets of Claron for $30.3 million. Claron is a leading provider of medical image viewing, distribution, sharing and collaboration software technology, and its solutions help healthcare delivery organizations pro  vide universal access to patient imaging studies and other content across and between healthcare enterprises. The Company also obtained pre-title to all remaining shares of ReadSoft. The $4.6 million payment for the ReadSoft non-controlling interest shares   can be found in   Net   c  ash flows (used for) provided by financing     activities   section of the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows  .     ReadSoft is a leading global provider of software solutions that automate business processes, both on premise and in the cloud.   
                 
              Marketable Securities  
                 
              The Company had no   Marketable securities   activity during the   nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 compa  red to $625.4 million net cash provided by   Marketable securities   for the nine   months ended   September 30, 2015. During the nine   months ended   September   30, 2015, the Company liquidated all of its marketable securities to fund the purchases of Kofax and Claro  n and to fund its dividend and treasury share repurchase activities.    
                 
              Capital Expenditures  
                 
              For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company spent $  57.1   million and $84.1   million, respectively, on capital expenditures. The capital expenditures for   2016   principally re  lated to infrastructure support (including internal-use software expenditures) and machinery and equipment related to new product development. The Company expects capital expenditures to be approximately $80.0 million for full year   2016  , compared to full year   2015   capital expenditures of $112.6 million. Capital expenditures for   2016   are expected to be funded through cash from operati  ons; however, if necessary, the Company may use existing cash and cash equivalents or additional sources of liquidity, as discussed below.  
                 
              Financing Activities  
                 
              Cash flows   used for   financing activities were $  118.0   million during the nine   months   ended September 30,     2016     compared to   cash flows provided by financing activities   of   $  302.0   million   during   the   nine   months   ended September 30,   2015. The YTY fluctuation of $  420.0   million was primarily driven by a decrease in net debt proceeds of $3  95.7   million in 2  016 and net debt payments of $44  .0 million. This was partially offset   by treasury stock repurchase  s of $4.0 million during the nine   m  onths ended September   30, 2016 as compared   to $30.0 million during the nine months ended September   30, 2015. The Company paused its share repurchases in the second quarter of 2015 which result  ed in favorable cash flows of $26.0 million year over year.

At   September   30, 2016, the outstanding balanc  e of senior note debt was $697.9   million (net of un  amortized issuance costs of $2.0   million and unamortized discount of $0.  1   million).  
                 
              The 2020 senior notes pay interest on March 15 and September 15 of each   year. The 2018 senior notes pay interest on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The interest rate payable on the notes of each series is subject to adjustments from time to time if either Moody s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor s Ratings Servi  ces downgrades the debt rating assigned to the notes to a level below investment grade, or subsequently upgrades the ratings.  
                 
              The senior notes contain typical restrictions on liens, sale leaseback transactions, mergers and sales of assets. There are no si  nking fund requirements on the senior notes and they may be redeemed at any time at the option of the Company, at a redemption price as described in the related indenture agreements, as supplemented and amended, in whole or in part. If a  change of control   triggering event  as defined below occurs, the Company will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes in cash from the holders at a    

47  

price equal to 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including,   the date of repurchase. A  change of control triggering event  is defined as the occurrence of both a change of control and a downgrade in the debt rating assigned to the notes to a level below investment grade.  
                 
              Additional Sources of Liquidity  
                 
              The Compan  y has additional liquidity available through its trade receivables facility and committed revolving credit facilit  y  . These sources can be accessed domestically if the Company is unable to satisfy its cash needs in the U.S. with cash flows provided by opera  tions and existing cash and cash equivalents.  
                 
              Trade Receivables Facility  
                 
              In the U.S., the Company, Lexmark Enterprise Software, LLC and Kofax, Inc. transfer a majority of their receivables to a wholly-owned subsidiary, Lexmark Receivables Corporation   ( LRC ),     which then may transfer the receivables on a limited recourse basis to an unrelated third party. The financial results of LRC are included in the Company s consolidated financial results since it is a wholly-owned subsidiary. LRC is a separate leg  al entity     with its own separate creditors who, in a liquidation of LRC, would be entitled to be satisfied out of LRC s assets prior to any value in LRC becoming available for equity claims of the Company. The Company accounts for transfers of receivables f  rom LRC to the unrelated third party as a secured borrowing with the pledge of its receivables as collateral since LRC has the ability to repurchase the receivables interests at a determinable price.  
                 
              On August 27, 2015, the trade receivables facility was   amended by extending the term of the facility to October 6, 2017.   In addition, Kofax, Inc. became a new originator under the facility, permitting advancements under the facility as accounts receivables are originated by Kofax, Inc. and sold to LRC.   The max  imum capital availability under the facility remains at   $125.0 million under the amended agreement. At   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding   balance of the   trade receivables facility was $12.0 million  . At December 31  , 2015, the outstanding balance of the trade receivables facility was $76.0 million.   The average daily balance under the trade receivables facility during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 was $100.5 million and $74.1 million, respectively.  
                 
              This faci  lity contains customary affirmative and negative covenants as well as specific provisions related to the quality of the accounts receivables transferred. Receivables transferred to the unrelated third party may not include amounts over 90 days past due or   concentrations over certain limits with any one customer. The facility also contains customary cash control triggering events which, if triggered, could adversely affect the Company s liquidity and/or its ability to obtain secured borrowings.  
                 
              Revolving Cr  edit Facility  
                 
              The Company currently has a $500 million, 5-year senior, unsecured, multicurrency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of February 5, 2019. The outstanding balance of the re  volving credit facility was $308  .0 million as of   September   30, 2016. The outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility was $288.0 million as of December 31, 2015.   The average daily balance under the revolving credit facility during the first   nine   mo  nths of 2016 and 2015 was $226.1   millio  n and $139.6   millio  n, respectively.  
                 
              The revolving credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains certain financial covenants, including those relating to a minimum interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and a maximum lev  erage ratio of not more than 3.0 to 1.0 as defined in the agreement. The revolving credit facility also limits, among other things, the Company s indebtedness, liens and fundamental changes to its structure and business.  
                 
              The revolving credit facility cont  ains a  change of control  provision in which if there is an acquisition of the Company, the administrative agent and/or the lenders may terminate the commitments and declare the principal and accrued interest on any loans then outstanding immediately due   and payable. Additional information is available on the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed January 23, 2012.  
                 
              On March 24, 2016, the revolving credit facility was amended for purposes of calculating the minimum interest coverage ratio, the maximum   leverage ratio and the maximum permitted indebtedness of the Company by reducing the impact of certain cash restructuring charges, incurred by the Company prior to September 30, 2016, in the calculation of  Consolidated EBITDA . Additional information rela  ted to the amendment can be found in the Form 8-K report that was filed with the SEC by the Company on March 25, 2016.  
                 
              Uncommitted Revolving Credit Facility  
                 
              On June 10  ,   2015, the Company entered into an agreement for an uncommitted revolving credit facil  ity. Under this agreement, the Company may borrow up to a total of     $100.0 million. There were no outstanding borrowings under the uncommitted revolving credit facility at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.   D  ue to the uncommitted nature of this agreement, the Company does not regard the uncommitted revolving credit facility as   a   source of future liquidity.     The average   daily balance under the uncommitted revolvin  g credit facility during the nine   months ending   S  eptember   30, 2016   and September 30, 2015 was $53.4 million and $54.0    

48  

million, respectively. The prior year average daily balance is calculated based on inception date of June 10, 2015 to period end of September 30, 2015.  
                 
              Credit Ratings and Other   Information  
                 
              The Company s credit ratings by S P, Fitch Ratings, Inc. and Moody s are BBB-, BBB- and Baa3, respectively. The ratings remain investment grade.  
                 
              The Company s credit rating can be influenced by a number of factors, including overall economic   conditions, the pending Merger Agreement, demand for the Company s products and services and ability to generate sufficient cash flow to service the Company s debt. A downgrade in the Company s credit rating to non-investment grade would decrease the maxim  um availability under its trade receivables facility, potentially increase the cost of borrowing under the revolving credit facility and increase the coupon payments on the Company s public debt, and likely have an adverse effect on the Company s ability t  o obtain access to new financings in the   future. The Company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that accelerate the maturity dates of its revolving credit facility or public debt.  
                 
              The Company was in compliance with all covenants and other requirements set forth in its debt agreements as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company believes that it is reasonably likely that it will continue to be in co  mpliance with such covenants in the near future.  

REC  ENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
                 
              Refer to   Note   15   of   the   Notes to   Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in Item 1 for   a description of recent accounting pronouncements which is incorporated herein by reference. There are no known material changes and trends nor any recognized future impact of new accounting guidance beyond the disclosures provided in Note   15  .  

Item 3.              QUANTITATIVE     AND   QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  
                 
              The market risk inherent in the Company s financial instruments and positions represents the potential loss   arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  
                 
              Interest Rates  
                 
              At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Company s   senior notes was estimated at $  737.2     million based on the prices the bonds have recently traded at in the market as well as the overall market conditions on the date of valuation, stated coupon rates, the number of coupon payments each year and the maturity dates. The fair value of the se  nior notes exceeded the carrying value as recorded in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Financial Position at   September 30, 2016   by   $  39.3     million. Market risk is estimated as the pot  ential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates and amounts to $  6.3   million at   September 30, 2016  .  
                 
              Since the borrowings under the revolving   credit facility and the accounts receivable program utilize variable interest rate setting mechanisms such as one-month LIBOR, the fair value of these borrowings is deemed to be at par and the sensitivity of these borrowings to changes in interest rates is   deemed to be immaterial.  
                 
              Foreign Currency Exchange Rates  
                 
              Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Company or the respective   functional   currency of each of the Company s subsidiaries     as well as foreign currency denominated revenue and profit translated into the functional currency of the Company  . The primary currencies to which the Company was exposed on a transaction basis as of   September 30, 2016     include the   Euro  , the   British pound  , the   Swiss franc  , the   Philippine peso  , the   Chinese renminbi  , the   Singapore dollar  , the   Australian dollar   and the   Norweigian krone  .   The Company primarily hedges its transaction foreign exchange     exposures with foreign currency forward contracts ( transaction hedge contracts ) with maturity dates of approximately three months or less, though al  l foreign     currency exposures may not be fully hedged.   T  he Company   hedges   anticipated foreign currency denominated sales with foreign exchange option     contracts ( cash flow hedge contracts ).   The potential     loss     in fair value at   September 30, 2016     for transaction   hedge contracts   and cash flow hedge contracts   resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates versus the U.S. dollar is   $  35.3     million. This     loss     would be mitigated by corresponding     gains     on the underlying exposures.

Item   4.            CONTROLS     AND     PROCEDURES  
                 
              Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
                 
              The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer   ( CEO )   and Vice President and Chief Financial Officer   ( CF  O )  , has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chairman and CEO and Vice President and   CFO   have concluded that the Compa  ny s disclosure controls and procedures  , as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,     were not   effective   because of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as described   in Management s   Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 201  5, which continues to exist as of   September 30, 2016  .  
                 
              Remediation of Material Wea  kness in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

With the oversight of the Company s Finance and Audit Committee, the Company   continued to take steps during the first nine months of 2016   to remediate its material weakness in internal control over acc  ounting for income taxes.   Building on its efforts during 2015, the Company made   progress   to     remediate the material weakness and further enhance   its internal controls. The Company continued to implement activities and   improvements   during the first nine mont  hs of 2016 which   include:

The Company has continued to make progress toward refining its design and operating effectiveness of internal control during the first   nine months   of 2016. The Company expects to make additional improvements in internal control during the remainder of 2016  . Given the annual nature of internal controls over accounting for income taxes, time is critical to fully integrate the new and redesigned controls into our processes and confirm them as effective and sustainable.  
                 
              Lexmark and our Board of Directors are c  ommitted to maintaining a strong and sustainable internal control environment. The Company believes that the remediation work completed to date has significantly improved our internal control over the accounting for income taxes. The Company believes it is   important to finalize remediation efforts in 2016 and confirm that the new processes and controls that were put in place as part of the remediation are fully operational and consistently applied for a sufficient period of time in order to provide the Comp  any with adequate assurance of a sustainable and reliable control environment related to income tax accounting.  
                 
              Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
                 
              T  here has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that   occurred during the   third   quarter of   2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting   other than the efforts discussed immediately above in   Remediation of the Material   Weakness   in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  .    

50  

Inherent Limitatio  ns on Effectiveness of Controls  
                 
              The Company s management, including the Company s Chairman and   CEO   and Vice President and   CFO  , does not expect that the Company s disclosure controls   and procedures or the Company s internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, regardless of how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the object  ives of the control system will be met.  These inherent limitations include the following:  

<li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 27.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       Judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and control and process breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.  

<li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 27.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       Controls can be circumvented by indi  viduals, acting alone or in collusion with each other, or by management override.  

<li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 27.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succee  d in achieving its stated goals under a  ll potential future conditions.  

<li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 27.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of complian  ce with policies or procedures.  

Because of the inherent limitation  s in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fra  ud, if any, have been detected.

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION  
                 
              Item 1.  LEGAL   PROCEEDINGS  
                 
              The information required by this item is set forth in   Note   14   of the Notes to   Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements, and is inc  orporated herein by reference.   Other than developments reported in Note   14  , there have been no   other   developments to the legal proceedings previously disclosed in Part II, Item 8, Note 19 of the Company     s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K  .  

Item 1A.  RISK   FACTORS  
                 
              Other than the risk factor set forth, below, there have been no material changes in the Company s risk factors that have been previously disclosed in     Part I, Item 1A of the Company s     2015     Annual Report on Form   10-K.  
                 
              The Company recently announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by a consortium of investors   composed   of Apex Technology Co., Ltd. and investment funds managed by PAG Asia Capital and Legend Capital.  The Company   conti  nues to   expect the transaction to close in   2  016  .    The Company s operating results may be adversely affected by the pendency of the transaction, and a failure to consummate the transaction could have an adverse effect on the share price of the Company s Class A Common Stock.   
                 
              The Company s pending acqui  sition by a consortium of investors   composed   of Apex Technology Co., Ltd. and investment funds managed by PAG Asia Capital and Legend Capital (collectively, the  Consortium ) creates various risks that could negatively impact the Company s operating result  s or the price of the Company s Class A Common Stock, including the following:  

<li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 45.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       the   pending acquisition may not be consummated on the expected timeframe or at all if the parties to the Merger Agreement fail to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or satis  fy other closing conditions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, some of which are outside of the Company s control;  
                <li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 45.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       the disruption of management s and employees  attention to ongoing business activities due to the pending transaction;  
                <li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 45.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       the potential   adver  se effect   of the pending acquisition   on the Company s ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees who may be uncertain about their future roles within the Company following the completion of the Merger;  
                <li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 45.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       the potential   adverse impact on the Company   s ability to maintain current relationships or establish relationships with vendors, suppliers and other business partners;  
                <li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 45.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       restrictions imposed on the Company s business and operati  ons   pursuant to certain interim operating covenants in the Merger Agreement may prevent the Company from pursuing certain business opportunities or taking certain actions with respect to the business and financial affairs of the Company without the Consortium   s consent;  
                <li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 45.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       the Company may forego certain business opportunities that it might otherwise pursue absent the pending acquisition  ; and  
                <li style="margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 45.6pt; text-indent:0pt; text-align:justify; padding-left:8.4pt; font-family:serif; font-size:10pt; -aw-font-family:'Symbol'; -aw-font-weight:normal; -aw-number-format:'       if the acquisition is not consummated, the Company may be required to pay a termination fee under certain circumstances as   provided in the Merger Agreement  .  

If the Merger is not consummated, and there are no other parties willing and able to acquire the Company at a price of $40.50 per share or higher on terms acceptable to the Company, the Company s share price will likely d  ecline, as our stock has recently traded at prices linked to the proposed per share consideration for the Merger.    
                 
              Additionally, the Company has incurred, and will continue to incur throughout the pendency of the Merger, certain costs, expenses and fees   for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the proposed Merger, for which the Company will have received little or no benefit if the Merger is not completed.  Many of these fees and costs will be payable by the Company even if   the Merger is not completed and may relate to activities that the Company would not have undertaken other than to complete the Merger.  
                 
              The Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage or make it difficult for a third party to acquire the Co  mpany prior to the completion of the proposed Merger.  
                 
              The Merger Agreement contains provisions that significantly restrict the Company s ability to entertain a third-party acquisition proposal during the pendency of the Merger. These provisions include a   general prohibition on soliciting or engaging in discussions or negotiations regarding any alternative acquisition proposal, subject to certain exceptions, and the requirement that the Company pay a termination fee of $95 million if the Merger Agreement is   terminated in specified circumstances, such as because our board of directors changes its recommendation to stockholders to vote in favor of the Merger. These provisions might discourage an otherwise-interested third party from considering or proposing an   acquisition transaction, even one that may be deemed of greater value than the proposed Merger to our stockholders. Furthermore, even if a third party elects to propose an acquisition, the requirement on our part to pay a termination fee may result in tha  t third party offering a lower value to our stockholders than such third party might otherwise have offered.
