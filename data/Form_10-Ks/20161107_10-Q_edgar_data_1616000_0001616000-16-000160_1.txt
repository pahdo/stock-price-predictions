1  .    Organization 
  Xenia Hotels   Resorts, Inc. (the "Company" or "Xenia") is a Maryland corporation that invests primarily in premium full service, lifestyle and urban upscale hotels. Prior to February 3, 2015, Xenia was a wholly owned subsidiary of InvenTrust Properties Corp. ("InvenTrust" formerly known as Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc.), its former parent. 
  On February 3, 2015, Xenia was spun off from InvenTrust through a taxable pro rata distribution by InvenTrust of   95%   of the outstanding common stock,   $0.01   par value per share (the "Common Stock"), of Xenia to holders of record of InvenTrust's common stock as of the close of business on January 20, 2015 (the "Record Date").  Each holder of record of InvenTrust's common stock received one share of Common Stock for every eight shares of InvenTrust s common stock held at the close of business on the Record Date (the "Distribution"). In lieu of fractional shares, stockholders of InvenTrust received cash.  On February 4, 2015, Xenia s Common Stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker symbol "XHR."  As a result of the Distribution, the Company became a stand-alone, publicly-traded company. Xenia operates as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for federal income tax purposes. 
  Substantially all of the Company's assets are held by, and all the operations are conducted through XHR LP (the "Operating Partnership").  XHR GP, Inc. is the sole general partner of XHR LP.  XHR GP, Inc. is wholly owned by the Company.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   98.7%   of the common limited partnership units issued by the Operating Partnership ("common units").  The remaining   1.3%   of the common units are owned by the other limited partners.  To qualify as a REIT, the Company cannot operate or manage its hotels.  Therefore, the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries lease the hotel properties to XHR Holding Inc. (collectively with its subsidiaries, "XHR Holding"), the Company's taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"), which engages third-party eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels.   
  The accompanying combined condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership, XHR Holding, as well as all wholly owned subsidiaries and consolidated investments in real estate entities.  The Company's subsidiaries and consolidated investments in real estate entities generally consist of limited liability companies ("LLCs"), limited partnerships ("LPs") and the TRS. The effects of all inter-company transactions have been eliminated.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   46   lodging properties,   44   of which were wholly owned, with a total of   11,594   rooms.  The remaining   two   hotels are owned through individual investments in real estate entities, in which the Company has a   75%   ownership interest in each investment.   
   
  2  .    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  The unaudited interim combined condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared on an accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") and in conformity with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") applicable to financial information.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC.  The unaudited financial statements include normal recurring adjustments, which management considers necessary for the fair presentation of the condensed consolidated balance sheets,   combined condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  , condensed consolidated statements of changes in equity and combined condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the periods presented.  The unaudited combined condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the combined consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 10, 2016.  Operating results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of actual operating results for the entire year. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  As described above, on February 3, 2015, Xenia was spun off from InvenTrust. Prior to the separation, the Company effectuated certain reorganization transactions which were designed to consolidate the ownership of its hotels into its Operating Partnership, consolidate its TRS lessees in its TRS, facilitate its separation from InvenTrust, and enable the Company to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  The accompanying combined condensed consolidated financial statements prior to the spin-off have been "carved out" of InvenTrust s consolidated financial statements and reflect significant assumptions and allocations.  The combined condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the Company after giving effect to the reorganization transactions, the disposition of other hotels previously owned by the Company, and the spin-off, and include allocations of costs from certain corporate and shared functions provided to the Company by InvenTrust, as well as

  Notes to Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)

costs associated with participation by certain of the Company's executives in InvenTrust s benefit plans.  Corporate costs directly associated with the Company's principal executive offices, personnel and other administrative costs are reflected as general and administrative expenses on the   combined condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  .  Additionally, prior to the spin-off, InvenTrust allocated to the Company a portion of its corporate overhead costs based upon the Company's percentage share of the average invested assets of InvenTrust, which is reflected in general and administrative expenses.  Based on these presentation matters, the financial statements for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   may not be comparable. 
  As InvenTrust was managing various asset portfolios, the extent of services and benefits a portfolio received was based on the size of its assets.  Therefore, using average invested assets to allocate costs was a reasonable reflection of the services and other benefits received by the Company and complied with applicable accounting guidance.  However, actual costs may have differed from allocated costs if the Company had operated as a stand-alone entity during such period and those differences may have been material.  
  Each property maintains its own books and financial records and each entity's assets are not available to satisfy the liabilities of other affiliated entities, except as otherwise disclosed in Note   7  .  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of the combined condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and revenues and expenses. These estimates are prepared using management's best judgment, after considering past, current and expected economic conditions. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
  Consolidation 
  The Company evaluates its investments in partially owned entities to determine whether such entities may be a variable interest entity ("VIE"). If the entity is a VIE, the determination of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary must be made. The primary beneficiary determination is based on a qualitative assessment as to whether the entity has (i) power to direct significant activities of the VIE and (ii) an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE. The Company will consolidate a VIE if it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary, as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810, Consolidation. The equity method of accounting is applied to entities in which the Company is not the primary beneficiary as defined in FASB ASC 810, or the entity is not a VIE and the Company does not have effective control, but can exercise influence over the entity with respect to its operations and major decisions.  
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis ("ASU 2015-02"), which amended the consolidation guidance for VIE's and general partner's investments in limited partnerships and modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnership and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities.  Upon adoption of ASU 2015-02, the Company concluded there was no change required in the accounting of its two previously identified VIEs in our two investments in real estate entities and therefore will continue to consolidate these VIEs for reporting purposes, as further described in Note 5.  However, the Company concluded that the Operating Partnership now meets the criteria as a VIE under ASU 2015-02.  The Company's significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership, as described in Note 1, and consequently, substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities represent those assets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership. As such, there is no change in the presentation of the consolidated financial statements of the Company upon adoption of ASU 2015-02. 
  Impairment 
  The Company assesses the carrying values of the respective long-lived assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of these assets may not be fully recoverable, such as a reduction in the expected holding period of the asset or a change in demand for lodging at the Company's hotels. If it is determined that the carrying value is not recoverable because the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed carrying value, the Company records an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value. The valuation and possible subsequent impairment of investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on the Company's continuous process of analyzing each property and reviewing assumptions about uncertain inherent factors, as well as the economic condition of the property at a particular point in time.

The use of projected future cash flows and related holding period is based on assumptions that are consistent with the estimates of future expectations and the strategic plan the Company uses to manage its underlying business. However, assumptions and estimates about future cash flows and capitalization rates are complex and subjective. Changes in economic and operating conditions and the Company s ultimate investment intent that occur subsequent to the impairment analyses could impact these assumptions and result in future impairment charges of the real estate properties. 
  Investment Properties Held for Sale 
  In determining whether to classify an investment property as held for sale, the Company considers whether: (i) management has committed to a plan to sell the investment property; (ii) the investment property is available for immediate sale, in its present condition; (iii) the Company is actively marketing the investment property for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its fair value; (iv) the Company has initiated a program to locate a buyer; (v) the Company believes that the sale of the investment property is probable; (vi) the Company has received a significant non-refundable deposit for the purchase of the property; (vii) actions required for the Company to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will be made to the plan. 
  If all of the above criteria are met, the Company classifies the investment property as held for sale. On the day that these criteria are met, the Company suspends depreciation and amortization on the investment properties held for sale. The investment properties and liabilities associated with those investment properties that are held for sale are classified separately on the   condensed   consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period and all comparative periods, and are presented at the lesser of the carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell. Additionally, if the sale constitutes a strategic shift with a major effect on operations, the operations for the investment properties held for sale are classified on the   combined condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income   as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  
  Share-Based Compensation  
  The Company has adopted a share-based incentive plan that provides for the grant of stock options, stock awards, restricted stock units, Operating Partnership units and other equity-based awards.  Share-based compensation is measured at the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant, adjusted for forfeitures, and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the longest vesting period for each grant for the entire award.  The determination of fair value of these awards is subjective and involves significant estimates and assumptions including expected volatility of the Company's shares, expected dividend yield, expected term and assumptions of whether certain of these awards will achieve parity with other Operating Partnership units or achieve performance thresholds.  Share-based compensation is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying   combined condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income   and capitalized in building and other improvements in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for certain employees that manage property developments, renovations and capital improvements. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective, although it will not affect the accounting for rental related revenues.  The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, pursuant to ASU No. 2015-09 which deferred the adoption date by one year.  Early adoption is permitted.  The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.      The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU No. 2014-09 and related updates will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  Although the Company is still evaluating the revenue streams and the timing of recognition under the new model, it is not expected to change significantly from current policies.  Additionally, the Company has begun evaluating the sale of non-financial assets to entities that are not customers, such as the disposition of real estate assets.  Historically, hotel dispositions have been cash sales that required no contingencies for future involvement in the hotel's operations and therefore the Company does not expect ASU No. 2014-09 to have a material impact on its recognition of hotel sales. The Company has not yet selected a transition method. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, which eliminates the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine the amounts, including the effect on earnings of any amounts that would have been recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This update was effective for interim and annual periods beginning after

December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The implementation of ASU 2015-16 on January 1, 2016 had no material impact on the Company's combined condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes by requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be presented as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect ASU No. 2015-17 to have a significant impact on its combined condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which replaces ASC Topic 840, Leases, and requires most lessee leases to be recorded on the Company's balance sheet as either operating or financing leases with a right of use asset with a corresponding lease liability measured at present value.  Operating leases will be recognized on the income statement on a straight-line basis as lease expense and financing leases will be accounted for similar to the accounting for amortizing debt. Leases with terms of less than 12 months will continue to be accounted for as they are under the current standard.  The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its combined condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Award Payment Accounting, which simplifies various aspects of how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. This standard requires companies to record all of the tax effects related to share-based payments through the income statement, allows companies to elect an accounting policy to either estimate the share based award forfeitures (and expense) or account for forfeitures (and expense) as they occur, and allows companies to withhold up to the maximum individual statutory tax rate the shares upon settlement of an award without causing the award to be classified as liability. This guidance is effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, however, early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect ASU No. 2016-09 to have a significant impact on its combined condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which changes the way certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified on the statement of cash flows in order to reduce diversity in practice across all industries. The standard clarifies classification for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and contingent consideration payments made after business combination among other things. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, however, early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect ASU No. 2016-15 to have a significant impact on its combined condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
   
  3  .    Acquired Properties 
  In June 2015, the Company entered into a purchase agreement to acquire a portfolio of three hotels: the RiverPlace Hotel in Portland, Oregon, the Canary hotel in Santa Barbara, California, and the Hotel Palomar in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (the "Kimpton Portfolio") for a total purchase price of   $245 million  , excluding closing costs,   which were expensed and included in acquisition costs on the combined condensed consolidated statement of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . These acquisitions closed in July 2015, and were funded with cash and borrowings under the Company's unsecured credit facility.

  The major classes of assets and liabilities for the   five   properties disposed of during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were as follows at   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):  

(1) 
    The Hilton University of Florida Conference Center Gainesville and the Marriott Atlanta Century Center/Emory Area were subject to ground leases.  The Company has no future obligations under the terms of these ground leases as part of the disposition of these hotels. 
     The operating results of the   five   hotels sold during   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, are included in the Company's combined condensed consolidated financial statements as part of continuing operations in accordance with ASU No. 2014-08 Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity ("ASU 2014-08") through the date of their disposition, as they did not represent a strategic shift or have a major effect on the Company's results of operations.  
  Discontinued Operations 
  In November 2014,   52   lodging properties were sold by InvenTrust (the "Suburban Select Service Portfolio"), which were properties previously overseen by the Company.  This disposition represented a strategic shift and had a major effect on the Company's results of operations.  Accordingly, the results of operations of these   52   lodging properties were presented as discontinued operations pursuant to ASU 2014-08.  During early 2015,   $489 thousand   in carryover costs related to the Suburban Select Service Portfolio were incurred and have been presented as discontinued operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
   
  5  .    Investment in Real Estate Entities 
  Consolidated Entities 
  During 2013, the Company entered into   two   investments in real estate entities in order to develop the Grand Bohemian Hotel Charleston and the Grand Bohemian Hotel Mountain Brook.  The Company has ownership interests of   75%   in each real estate entity.  These entities are considered VIE's as defined in ASU 2015-02 because the entities did not have enough equity to finance their activities without additional subordinated financial support.  The Company determined that it has the power to direct the activities of the VIE's that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, as well as the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE's that could potentially be significant to the VIE, or the right to receive benefits from the VIE's that  
  
   13 

XENIA HOTELS   RESORTS, INC. 
  Notes to Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
  September 30, 2016 

could potentially be significant to the VIE.  As such, the Company has a controlling financial interest and is considered the primary beneficiary of each of these entities.  Therefore, these entities are consolidated by the Company.  
  The following are the liabilities of the consolidated VIE's, which are non-recourse to the Company, and the assets that can be used to settle those obligations (in thousands): 

In August 2015, the Grand Bohemian Hotel Charleston began operations as a   50  -room lifestyle hotel. The total development cost of the property was   $32 million  . In October 2015, the Grand Bohemian Hotel Mountain Brook began operations as a   100  -room lifestyle hotel. The total development cost of the property was   $45 million  .   
  All operations of the two hotels for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were consolidated in the accompanying   combined condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  , with a corresponding allocation for non-controlling interests.  
   
  6  .    Transactions with Related Parties 
  The following table summarizes the Company s related party transactions (in thousands):   

           (a) 
    General and administrative allocations include costs from certain corporate and shared functions provided to the Company by InvenTrust, as well as costs associated with participation by certain of the Company's executives in InvenTrust's benefit plans.  InvenTrust allocated to the Company a portion of its corporate overhead costs which was based upon the Company's percentage share of the average invested assets of InvenTrust.  As InvenTrust was managing various asset portfolios, the extent of services and benefits a portfolio received was based on the size of its assets.  Therefore, using average invested assets to allocate costs was a reasonable reflection of the services and other benefits received by the Company and complied with applicable accounting guidance.  However, actual costs may have differed from allocated costs if the Company had operated as a stand-alone entity during such period and those differences may have been material.  Following the spin-off, the Company was not allocated any further general and administrative expenses. 
              (b) 
    In connection with the Company's separation from InvenTrust, the Company entered into a transition services agreement with InvenTrust under which InvenTrust agreed to provide certain transition services to the Company, including services related to information technology systems, financial reporting and accounting and legal services.  The expiration date varied by service provided and the agreement terminated on the earlier of March 31, 2016 or the termination of the last service provided under it. In June 2015, the Company terminated all fee-based services provided under the transition services agreement effective July 31, 2015, and thereafter, no additional fees are expected to be incurred for services provided by InvenTrust. 
     As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company owed   $0   and   $2.6 million  , respectively, to InvenTrust which is included in other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the amount due to InvenTrust was related to purchases of furniture, fixtures and equipment funded by InvenTrust and to taxes paid by InvenTrust on behalf of the Company.

              (11) 
    In February 2016, the Company refinanced the mortgage with a new loan bearing a   4.53%   fixed interest rate and March 2026 maturity. Additional proceeds of approximately   $11 million   were received under the refinanced terms of the mortgage, which increased the principal of the loan from approximately   $49 million   to   $60 million  .

Senior Unsecured Credit Facility 
  Prior to the consummation of the spin-off transaction, the Company was allocated   $96 million   of InvenTrust's revolving credit facility.  Effective February 3, 2015, this allocation was terminated and the Company entered into a new   $400 million   senior unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks.  The new revolving credit facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature which, subject to certain conditions, allows the Company to increase the aggregate availability by up to an additional   $350 million  .  Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest based on LIBOR plus a margin ranging from   1.50%   to   2.45%   (or, at the Company's election upon achievement of an investment grade rating from Moody s Investor Services, Inc. or Standard   Poor s Rating Services, interest based on LIBOR plus a margin ranging from   0.875%   to   1.50%  ).  In addition, until such election, the Company expects to pay an unused commitment fee of up to   0.30%   of the unused portion of the credit facility based on the average daily unused portion of the credit facility; thereafter, the Company expects to pay a facility fee ranging between   0.125%   and   0.35%   based on the Company's debt rating.   
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   no   outstanding balance on the senior unsecured facility and during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred unused commitment fees of approximately   $0.3 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred unused commitment fees of approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million  , respectively. 
   
  8  .    Derivatives    
  The Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk management strategy. For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, unrealized gains and losses on the effective portion are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a component of stockholders  equity.  Unrealized gains and losses on the ineffective portion of all designated hedges are recognized in earnings in the current period.  At   September 30, 2016  , all derivative instruments were designated as cash flow hedges.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate fair value of interest rate swap liabilities of   $9.9 million   was included in other liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company had an unrealized gain of   $1.4 million   and an unrealized loss of   $14.3 million  , respectively, that is included in the   combined condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  .  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company had   no   unrealized gain or loss as hedging activities were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
  The following table summarizes the terms of the derivative financial instruments held by the Company and the liability and asset that has been recorded as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively (in thousands)   (1)   :

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company reclassified   $1.0 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively, from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense. The Company expects approximately   $3.1 million   will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to interest expense in the next   12   months. 
   
  9  .    Fair Value Measurements 
  In accordance with FASB ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement and Disclosures, the Company defines fair value based on the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or the exit price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The Company uses a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value.  The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which are described below: 
             
    Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access. 
                
    Level 2 - Observable inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
                
    Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities.  This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs. 
     The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial and non-financial instruments using available market information and valuation methodologies it believes to be appropriate for these purposes.  Considerable judgment and a high degree of subjectivity are involved in developing these estimates and, accordingly, they are not necessarily indicative of amounts that would be realized upon disposition. 
  Recurring Measurements 
  For assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, quantitative disclosure of their fair value is as follows (in thousands): 

The fair value of each derivative instrument is based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash flows under each arrangement. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivative instrument, including the period to maturity, and utilizes observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities, which are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The Company also incorporates credit value adjustments to appropriately reflect each parties  nonperformance risk in the fair value measurement, which utilizes level 3 inputs such as estimates of current credit spreads. However, the Company has assessed that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of the derivatives. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations in their entirety are classified within level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Non-Recurring Measurements 
  Investment Properties 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company identified   two   hotel properties that had a reduction in their expected holding period and reviewed the probability of the assets' disposition.  The Company recorded an impairment charge  
  
   18 

XENIA HOTELS   RESORTS, INC. 
  Notes to Combined Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
  September 30, 2016 

of   $10.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , based on the estimated fair value using purchase contracts and average selling costs.  These properties were subsequently sold in May and June 2016, respectively.    No     impairments were recorded for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value 
  The table below represents the fair value of financial instruments presented at carrying values in the combined condensed consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):   

  The Company estimates the fair value of its mortgages payable using a weighted average effective interest rate of   3.44%   and   3.48%   per annum as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company has determined that its debt instrument valuations are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
   
  10  .    Income Taxes    
  The Company intends to operate in a manner that will allow the Company to qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.  To qualify as a REIT, the Company cannot operate or manage its hotels.  So long as the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that is currently distributed to its stockholders. A REIT is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it currently distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (subject to certain adjustments) to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, without the benefit of certain relief provisions, the Company will be subject to federal, state and local income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates and will not be eligible to re-elect REIT status during the four years following the failure. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income, property or net worth and federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income. 
  Accordingly, the Company, through its Operating Partnership, leases all of its hotels to subsidiaries of its TRS.  The TRS is subject to federal, state and local income tax at regular corporate rates.  Lease revenue at the REIT landlord subsidiaries and lease expense at the TRS lessees are eliminated in consolidation for financial statement purposes.   
  The Company estimated the TRS income tax expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   using an estimated federal and state statutory combined rate of   39.37%  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   the Company recognized income tax benefit of   $0.2 million     and income tax expense of   $9.6 million  , respectively. 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized income tax benefit of   $0.1 million   and expense of   $8.3 million  , respectively, of which   $1.9 million   of the expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   related to taxes on a one-time gain on the transfer of a hotel resulting in a more optimal structure in connection with the Company's intention to be taxed as a REIT.  
  For both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to the dividends paid deduction, state income taxes, and changes to valuation allowances. 
   
  11  .    Stockholders' Equity    
  Common Shares  
  On February 4, 2015, in conjunction with the listing of the Company's Common Stock on the NYSE, the Company commenced a modified  Dutch Auction  self-tender offer (the  Tender Offer ) to purchase for cash up to   $125 million   in value of shares of the Company s Common Stock at a price not greater than   $21.00   nor less than   $19.00   per share, net to the seller in cash, less any applicable withholding of taxes and without interest. The Tender Offer expired on March 5, 2015. As a result of the Tender Offer, the Company accepted for purchase   1,759,344   shares of its Common Stock at a purchase price of $  21.00   per share, for an aggregate purchase price of   $36.9   million (excluding fees and expenses relating to the Tender Offer), which was funded from

cash on hand. The   1,759,344   shares of Common Stock accepted for purchase in the Tender Offer represented approximately   1.6%   of the Company s Common Stock outstanding as of February 3, 2015, the last day prior to the commencement of the Tender Offer. Stockholders who properly tendered and did not properly withdraw shares of Common Stock in the Tender Offer at or below the final purchase price of $  21.00   per share had all of their tendered shares of Common Stock purchased by the Company at   $21.00   per share.  
  Stock Repurchase Program 
  In December 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the "Repurchase Program") pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to   $100 million   of the Company s outstanding Common Stock, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans. The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date.  The Company is not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or any number of shares of common stock, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   337,113   and   4,466,048   shares, respectively, had been repurchased under the Repurchase Program, at a weighted average price of   $16.44   and   $14.84  , respectively, per share for an aggregate purchase price of   $5.5 million   and   $66.3 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $33.7 million   remaining under its share repurchase authorization. 
  Distributions 
  Common Stock  
  The Company paid or declared the following dividends on Common Stock during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

Non-Controlling Interest of Common Units in Operating Partnership  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Operating Partnership had   1,378,573   long-term incentive partnership units ( LTIP units ) outstanding,   representing a   1.3%   partnership interest held by the limited partners  . Of the   1,378,573   LTIP units outstanding at   September 30, 2016  ,   118,960   units had vested. Only vested LTIP units may be converted to common units of the Operating Partnership, which in turn can be tendered for redemption as described in Note   13  .  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had accrued   $97 thousand   in dividends related to the LTIP units, which were paid in October 2016. 
   
  12  .    Earnings Per Share    
  Basic earnings per common share is calculated by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period, plus any shares that could potentially be outstanding during the period.  Any anti-dilutive shares have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.  
  Unvested share-based awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.  Accordingly, distributed and undistributed earnings attributable to unvested share-based compensation (participating securities) have been excluded, as applicable, from net income or loss available to common stockholders used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.  
  Income allocated to non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership has been excluded from the numerator and Common Units and vested LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership have been omitted from the denominator for the purpose of computing diluted earnings per share since including these amounts in the numerator and denominator would have no impact.

  2014 Share Unit Plan 
  On September 17, 2014, the board of directors of InvenTrust and the Company s Board of Directors adopted and ratified the Xenia Hotels   Resorts, Inc. 2014 Share Unit Plan (the "2014 Share Unit Plan"). The 2014 Share Unit Plan provided for the grant of notional "share unit" awards to eligible participants. Refer to Exhibit 99.1 of the Company's Registration Statement on Form 10, filed on January 9, 2015, as amended, for additional information regarding the 2014 Share Unit Plan. The 2015 Incentive Award Plan, as defined below, replaced the 2014 Share Unit Plan in connection with the Company s separation from InvenTrust, and the 2014 Share Unit Plan was terminated in connection with the implementation of the 2015 Incentive Award Plan. Awards outstanding under the 2014 Share Unit Plan at the time of its termination will remain outstanding in accordance with their terms, and the terms and conditions of the 2014 Share Unit Plan will continue to govern such awards.  
  2015 Incentive Award Plan 
  On January 9, 2015, the Company adopted, and InvenTrust as its sole common stockholder approved, the Company's 2015 Incentive Award Plan (the "2015 Incentive Award Plan") effective as of February 2, 2015 (the date prior to the date of the Company's separation from InvenTrust), under which the Company may grant cash and equity incentive awards to eligible service providers in order to attract, motivate and retain the talent for which the Company competes. Refer to Exhibit 99.1 of the Company's Registration Statement on Form 10, filed on January 9, 2015, as amended, for additional information regarding the 2015 Incentive Award Plan.  The plan allows for the grant of both share-based awards relating to the Company's Common Stock and partnership units ("LTIP units") in the Operating Partnership. 
  Restricted Stock Units  
  In March 2016, the Compensation Committee ("the Compensation Committee") of the Board of Directors of the Company granted share units to certain Company employees (the "2016 Restricted Stock Units"). The 2016 Restricted Stock Units  
  
   21 

XENIA HOTELS   RESORTS, INC.

include   104,079   restricted stock units that are time-based and vest over a   three   year period and   51,782   restricted stock units that are performance-based.  Both the time-based and performance-based units are subject to continued employment and have a weighted average grant date fair value of   $13.09   per share. 
  In April 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company granted an additional   26,738   time-based 2016 Restricted Stock Units to a new executive, with a grant date fair value of   $15.34  , with 50% of the time-based 2016 Restricted Stock Units vesting on February 4, 2017 and the remaining 50% vesting on February 4, 2018. 
  Other than the new awards granted to a new executive, each time-based 2016 Restricted Stock Unit will vest as follows, subject to the employee s continued service through each applicable vesting date:   33%   on February 4, 2017, which is the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date of the award (February 4, 2016),   33%   on the second anniversary of the vesting commencement date, and   34%   on the third anniversary of the vesting commencement date.   
  Of the performance-based 2016 Restricted Stock Units, twenty-five percent (  25%  ) are designated as absolute total stockholder return ("TSR") units (the "Absolute TSR Share Units"), and vest based on varying levels of the Company s TSR over the defined performance period.  The other seventy-five percent (  75%  ) of the performance-based 2016 Restricted Stock Units are designated as relative TSR share units (the "Relative TSR Share Units") and vest based on the ranking of the Company s TSR as compared to its defined peer group over the defined performance period. 
  LTIP Unit Grants  
  LTIP Units are a class of limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership.  Initially the LTIP Units do not have full parity with common units of the Operating Partnership with respect to liquidating distributions. However, upon the occurrence of certain events described in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement, the LTIP Units can over time achieve   full parity with the common units for all purposes. If such parity is reached, vested LTIP Units may be converted into an equal number of common units on a one for one basis at any time at the request of the LTIP Unit holder or the general partner of the Operating Partnership. Common units are redeemable for cash based on the fair market value of an equivalent number of shares of the Company s Common Stock, or, at the election of the Company, an equal number of shares of the Company s Common Stock, each subject to adjustment in the event of stock splits, specified extraordinary distributions or similar events.  
  In March 2016, the Compensation Committee approved the issuance of   664,515   performance-based LTIP Units (the "2016 Class A LTIP Units") and   78,076   time-based LTIP Units (the "2016 Time-Based LTIP Units") of the Operating Partnership under the 2015 Incentive Award Plan that had a weighted average grant date fair value of   $7.86   per unit.  
  In April 2016, the Compensation Committee approved the issuance of   110,179   2016 Class A LTIP Units and   12,945   2016 Time-Based LTIP Units to a new executive that had an average grant date fair value of   $7.85   per unit. 
  Each award of Time-Based LTIP Units will vest as follows, subject to the executive s continued service through each applicable vesting date:   33%   on February 4, 2017, which is the first anniversary of the vesting commencement date of the award (February 4, 2016),   33%   on the second anniversary of the vesting commencement date, and   34%   on the third anniversary of the vesting commencement date.  
  In May 2016, pursuant to the Company's Director Compensation Program, as amended and restated as of September 17, 2015, the Company approved the issuance of   33,894   fully vested LTIP Units of the Operating Partnership under the 2015 Incentive Award Plan to the Company's seven non-employee directors with a weighted average grant date fair value of   $15.49  . 
  A portion of each award of Class A LTIP Units is designated as a number of  base units.   Twenty-five percent (  25%  ) of the base units are designated as absolute TSR base units, and vest based on varying levels of the Company s TSR over the defined performance period.  The other seventy-five percent (  75%  ) of the base units are designated as relative TSR base units and vest based on the ranking of the Company s TSR as compared to its defined peer group over the defined performance period. 
  LTIP Units (other than Class A LTIP Units that have not vested), whether vested or not, receive the same quarterly per-unit distributions as common units in the Operating Partnership, which equal the per-share distributions on the Common Stock of the Company. Class A LTIP Units that have not vested receive a quarterly per-unit distribution equal to   10%   of the distribution paid on common units in the Operating Partnership.

The following is a summary of the non-vested incentive awards under the 2014 Share Unit Plan and the 2015 Incentive Award Plan as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
     Includes time-based and performance-based units. 
       
  The fair value of the time-based awards is determined based on the closing price of the Company s Common Stock on the grant date and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.  The grant date fair value of performance awards for the 2016 Restricted Stock Units and the 2016 Class A LTIP Units were determined based on a Monte Carlo simulation method with the following assumptions, and compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the performance period: 

The absolute and relative stockholder returns are market conditions as defined by ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Market conditions include provisions wherein the vesting condition is met through the achievement of a specific value of the Company s Common Stock, which is total stockholder return in this case.  Market conditions differ from other performance awards under ASC 718 in that the probability of attaining the condition (and thus vesting in the shares) is reflected in the initial grant date fair value of the award. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to reconsider the probability of vesting in the award subsequent to the initial measurement of the award, nor is it appropriate to reverse any of the expense if the condition is not met.   
  Therefore, once the expense for these awards is measured, the expense must be recognized over the service period regardless of whether the target is met, or at what level the target is met. Expense may only be reversed if the holder of the instrument forfeits the award by leaving the employment of the Company prior to vesting. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   the Company recognized approximately   $2.2 million   and   $7.5 million  , respectively, of share-based compensation expense (net of forfeitures) related to share units, restricted stock units, and LTIP Units provided to certain of its executive officers, other officers and members of management, which included   $1.2 million   of accelerated share-based compensation expense related to management transition and severance agreements,   $0   and  $525 thousand   was provided to the Company's Board of Directors, and capitalized approximately   $148 thousand   and   $403 thousand  , respectively, related to restricted stock units provided to certain members of management that oversee development and capital projects on behalf of the Company. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $12.7 million   of total unrecognized

compensation costs related to non-vested restricted share units, Class A LTIP Units and Time-Based LTIP Units issued under the 2014 Share Unit Plan and the 2015 Incentive Award Plan, as applicable, which are expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average period of   1.8   additional years.  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized   $0.0   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, of share-based compensation expense related to stock payments under the 2014 Incentive Award Plan, of which   $1.1 million   was provided to the Board of Directors and   $9 thousand   was provided to certain executive officers. In addition, in connection with the 2014 Share Unit Plan and the 2015 Incentive Award Plan, during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   the Company recognized approximately   $1.4 million   and   $4.0 million  , respectively, in compensation expense related to Restricted Stock Units, Class A LTIP Units and Time-Based LTIPs provided to certain of its executive officers and members of management and capitalized approximately   $94 thousand   and   $264 thousand  , respectively, related to Restricted Stock Units provided to certain members of management that oversee development and capital projects on behalf of the Company.  Additionally, this includes a cumulative catch up for compensation expense related to the fourth quarter of 2014 because the effectiveness of the grants was subject to the completion of the spin-off of the Company from InvenTrust, which occurred on February 3, 2015. 
   
  14  .   Commitments and Contingencies 
  Certain leases and operating agreements require the Company to reserve funds relating to replacements and renewals of the hotels' furniture, fixtures and equipment.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had a balance of   $71.6 million   and   $65.7 million  , respectively, in reserves for such future improvements.  This amount is included in restricted cash and escrows on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  In January 2016, the Company acquired the Hotel Commonwealth, which is subject to a long-term triple net ground lease.  The ground lease expires in December 2087.  The hotel is required to pay annual base rent of   $10   per year for the remaining term of the ground lease. 
  In September 2016, the Company commenced on the amended lease for its corporate office headquarters.  The lease expires in September 2028, and requires the Company to make annual rental payments of approximately   $0.4 million   which escalate over the term of lease. 
  The Company is subject, from time to time, to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business.  While the resolution of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes, based on currently available information, that the final outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the Company. 
  In addition, in connection with the Company's separation from InvenTrust, on August 8, 2014, the Company entered into an Indemnity Agreement, as amended, with InvenTrust pursuant to which InvenTrust has agreed to the fullest extent allowed by law or government regulation, to absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its subsidiaries, directors, officers, agents, representatives and employees (in each case, in such person s respective capacity as such) and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assignees from and against all losses, including but not limited to "actions" (as defined in the Indemnity Agreement), arising from: (1) the non-public, formal, fact-finding investigation by the SEC as described in InvenTrust's public filings with the SEC (the "SEC Investigation"); (2) the three related demands (including the Derivative Lawsuit described below) received by InvenTrust ("Derivative Demands") from stockholders to conduct investigations regarding claims similar to the matters that are subject to the SEC Investigation and as described in InvenTrust' public filings with the SEC; (3) the derivative lawsuit filed on March 21, 2013 on behalf of InvenTrust by counsel for stockholders who made the first Derivative Demand (the "Derivative Lawsuit"); and (4) the investigation by the Special Litigation Committee of the board of directors of InvenTrust. In each case, regardless of when or where the loss took place, or whether any such loss, claim, accident, occurrence, event or happening is known or unknown, and regardless of whether such loss, claim, accident, occurrence, event or happening giving rise to the loss existed prior to, on or after February 3, 2015, the separation date or relates to, arises out of or results from actions, inactions, events, omissions, conditions, facts or circumstances occurring or existing prior to, on or after February 3, 2015, the separation date. 
   
  15  .    Subsequent Events    
  In October 2016, the Company elected its prepayment option under the terms of   three   hotel mortgage loans, each of which had maturities in either 2016 or 2017, and repaid the outstanding balances and accrued interest totaling   $130.7 million  .  In addition  
  
   24

  September 30, 2016 

to these repayments, the Company modified   two   mortgage loans, which resulted in   $41 million   of additional proceeds, and extended the maturity dates of the loan through January 2022.  
  Subsequent to quarter end and as of November 4, 2016, the Company repurchased an additional   402,715   shares for an aggregate purchase price of   $6.2 million  .  A total of   4,868,763   shares have been repurchased, at a weighted average price of   $14.88   per share, for total consideration of approximately   $72.5 million   as of November 4, 2016.  
  In November 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional   $75 million   of the Company's outstanding common shares.  Repurchases may be made in open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or by other means, including Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  This repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of shares.  Inclusive of this additional authorization, the Company had approximately   $102.5 million   remaining under its total repurchase authorization as of November 4, 2016.

Overview  
  Xenia Hotels   Resorts, Inc. ("we", "us", "our", "Xenia" or the "Company") is a self-advised and self-administered REIT that invests primarily in premium full service, lifestyle and urban upscale hotels, with a focus on the top 25 markets as well as key leisure destinations in the United States.  A premium full service hotel refers to a hotel defined as "upper upscale" or "luxury" by STR Inc. ("STR"), but excluding hotels referred to as "lifestyle" hotels.  A lifestyle hotel refers to an innovative hotel with a focus on providing a unique and individualized guest experience in a smaller footprint by combining traditional hotel services with modern technologies and placing an emphasis on local influence.  An urban upscale hotel refers to a hotel located in an urban or similar high-density commercial area, such as a central business district, and defined as "upscale" or "upper midscale" by STR.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   46   hotels,   44   of which are wholly owned, comprising   11,594   rooms, across   20   states and the District of Columbia, and had a 75% ownership interest in two hotels owned through two consolidated investments in real estate entities.  Our hotels are primarily operated by industry leaders such as Marriott  , Kimpton  , Hyatt  , Aston  , Fairmont  , Hilton   and Loews  , as well as leading independent management companies. 
  Basis of Presentation 
  On February 3, 2015, Xenia was spun off from InvenTrust Properties Corp. ("InvenTrust" formerly known as Inland American Real Estate Trust, Inc.), its former parent. Prior to the separation, we effectuated certain reorganization transactions which were designed to consolidate the ownership of our hotels into our operating partnership; consolidate our TRS lessees in our TRS; facilitate our separation from InvenTrust; and enable us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  The accompanying combined condensed consolidated financial statements prior to the spin-off have been "carved out" of InvenTrust s consolidated financial statements and reflect significant assumptions and allocations.  The combined condensed consolidated financial statements reflect our operations after giving effect to the reorganization transactions, the disposition of other hotels previously owned by us, and the spin-off, and include allocations of costs from certain corporate and shared functions provided to us by InvenTrust, as well as costs associated with participation by certain of our executives in InvenTrust s benefit plans.  Corporate costs directly associated with our principal executive offices, personnel and other administrative costs are reflected as general and administrative expenses on the   combined condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  .  Additionally, prior to the spin-off, InvenTrust allocated to us a portion of its corporate overhead costs based upon our percentage share of the average invested assets of InvenTrust, which is reflected in general and administrative expenses.  Based on these presentation matters, these financials may not be comparable to prior periods.  
   
  Our Revenues and Expenses    
  Our revenue is primarily derived from hotel operations, including room revenue, food and beverage revenue and other operating department revenue, which consists of parking, telephone, other guest services and tenant leases. 
  Our operating costs and expenses consist of the costs to provide hotel services, including room expense, food and beverage expense, management fees and other direct and indirect operating expenses.  Room expense includes housekeeping wages and associated payroll taxes, room supplies, laundry services and front desk costs.  
  Food and beverage expense primarily includes the cost of food, beverages and associated labor.  Other direct and indirect hotel expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other operating department revenue, as well as labor and other costs associated with general and administrative departments, sales and marketing, information technology and telecommunications, repairs and maintenance and utility costs.  Our hotels are managed by independent, third-party management companies under long-term agreements under which the management companies typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel.  
   
  Key Indicators of Operating Performance 
  We measure hotel results of operations and the operating performance of our business by evaluating financial and non-financial metrics such as RevPAR; average daily rate ("ADR"); occupancy rate ("occupancy" or "OCC"); earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") and Adjusted EBITDA ("Adjusted EBITDA"); and funds from operations ("FFO") and Adjusted FFO ("Adjusted FFO").  We evaluate individual hotel and company-wide performance with comparisons to budgets, prior periods and competing properties. ADR, occupancy and RevPAR may be impacted by macroeconomic factors as well as regional and local economies and events.  See "Non-GAAP Financial Measures" for further discussion of the Company's use, definitions and limitations of EBITDA and FFO and Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted FFO.

Results of Operations 
   
  Overview 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were continued signs of softening trends in the overall US lodging industry. Overall US lodging industry demand increased during the   third   quarter of   2016  , with demand growth slightly out pacing supply growth year to date, and increases in RevPAR continued to be driven by rate. As a result, the industry showed a moderate increase in RevPAR of 3.3% for the   third   quarter of   2016  , driven by ADR growth of 3.4% and a flat occupancy as reported by STR. Our overall portfolio saw similar trends in RevPAR during the third quarter, with a majority of growth from prior year driven by rate and relatively flat occupancy. 
  Our total portfolio RevPAR, which includes the results of hotels that were sold or acquired during the respective periods presented, increased   6.3%   to   $156.63   and   5.8%   to   $152.49   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $147.31   and   $144.11  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively.    The increase in our total portfolio RevPAR during 2016 was partially driven by the moderate pricing increase in the overall US lodging industry but was primarily attributable to changes in our portfolio mix.  During the second half of 2015, we acquired three high-quality hotels, opened two hotels that we developed and own through our two consolidated real estate entities and sold one hotel property.  During the first quarter of 2016, we completed one hotel acquisition that further contributed to increases in the overall portfolio metrics. Additionally during 2016, we completed the dispositions of five hotels with an average RevPAR significantly below the remainder of our portfolio, which also helped to improve our overall portfolio metrics. 
  The total portfolio RevPAR for   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was negatively impacted by the continued declines in our four Houston-area hotels attributable to the volatile energy markets and new supply. On average our Houston-area hotels had an average decrease of 24.5% in RevPAR for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 2015, which was driven by an 11.5% decrease in ADR and a decrease in occupancy of 1,094 basis points, and an average decrease of 16.4% in RevPAR for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to 2015, driven by a 6.3% decrease in ADR and a decrease in occupancy of 830 basis points.  
  Net income attributable to common stockholders increased   11.9%   and   37.6%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to 2015, primarily attributable to the one-time separation and other start-up related expenses incurred during 2015 as part of our spin-off to a publicly traded company offset by the provision for asset impairment and the loss on extinguishment of debt incurred during 2016.  Adjusted EBITDA for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   decreased   2.4%   and increased   1.6%  , respectively, compared to 2015. Adjusted FFO for the third quarter decreased   2.5%   and increased   0.5%   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to 2015, which was primarily attributable to changes in our portfolio mix.

   33 

Other income 
  Other income decreased   $2.5 million  , or   73.0%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which was primarily attributable to the involuntary loss and business interruption insurance recovery income of $2.5 million that was received for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   and $0.5 million of other expenses. These decreases were offset by an increase of $0.5 million in other reimbursements income and a reduction in expenses related to termination of management agreements incurred in 2015. 
   
  Interest expense  
  Interest expense decreased   $0.1 million  , or   1.0%  , to   $12.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $12.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   and   $0.7 million  , or   1.8%  , to   $38.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $38.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was primarily the result of a lower weighted average interest rate of   3.39%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to 3.93% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Loss on extinguishment of debt

In 2015, the Company utilized federal net operating loss ("NOL") carry forwards to offset current taxable income. These NOLs were fully utilized during 2015 and were no longer available to offset income tax expense in the first nine months of 2016. Additionally, in 2015, the Company incurred a one-time $1.9 million income tax expense associated with transferring a hotel between entities in connection with electing REIT status. 
   
  Net loss from discontinued operations  
  Net loss from discontinued operations decreased   $489 thousand  , or   100.0%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . In November 2014,   52   lodging properties were sold by InvenTrust (the "Suburban Select Service Portfolio"), which were properties previously overseen by the Company, and the sale represented a strategic shift and had a major effect on the Company's results of operations. During early 2015,   $489 thousand   in carryover costs related to the Suburban Select Service Portfolio were incurred and have been presented as discontinued operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015     combined condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  . 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements from cash on hand, cash flow from operations, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and the ability to refinance or extend our maturing debt as it becomes due.  The objectives of our cash management policy are to maintain the availability of liquidity and minimize operational costs.  Further, we have an investment policy that is focused on the preservation of capital and maximizing the return on new and existing investments.  
  On a long-term basis, our objectives are to maximize revenue and profits generated by our existing properties and acquired hotels, to further enhance the value of our portfolio and produce an attractive current yield, as well as to generate sustainable and predictable cash flow from our operations to distribute to our stockholders.  To the extent we are able to successfully improve the performance of our portfolio, we believe this will result in increased operating cash flows.  Additionally, we may meet our long-term liquidity requirements through additional borrowings, the issuance of equity and debt securities, and/or proceeds from the sales of hotels.  
  We may, from time to time, seek to retire or purchase additional amounts of our outstanding equity through cash purchases and/or exchanges for other securities in open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan.  Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors.  The amounts involved may be material.   In December 2015, the Company s Board of  
  
   34 

Directors authorized a share repurchase program pursuant to which we are authorized to purchase up to $100 million of the Company s outstanding common stock, par value $0.01, per share, in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 plans (the "Repurchase Program").  The Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date.  The Company is not obligated to repurchase any dollar amount or any number of shares of common stock, and repurchases may be suspended or discontinued at any time.   
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   337,113   and   4,466,048   shares had been repurchased under the Repurchase Program, at a weighted average price of   $16.44   and   $14.84  , respectively, per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $  66.3 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had approximately   $33.7 million   remaining under its share repurchase authorization.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $185.3 million   of consolidated cash and cash equivalents and   $85.6 million   of restricted cash and escrows.  The restricted cash as of   September 30, 2016   primarily consists of cash held in restricted escrows of $5.1 million for real estate taxes and insurance, $8.9 million in disposition related escrow and capital spending reserves, and   $71.6 million     related to lodging furniture, fixtures and equipment reserves as required per the terms of our management and franchise agreements. 
  Credit facility  
  We have a $400 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks.  The revolving credit facility includes an uncommitted accordion feature which, subject to certain conditions, allows us to increase the aggregate availability by up to an additional $350 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   outstanding balance under the unsecured revolving credit facility. 
  Unsecured Term Loans and Mortgages 
  In January 2016, we borrowed   $125 million   on the unsecured term loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus the applicable rate, as defined per the respective agreement, maturing in October 2022. In December 2015, the Company entered into forward starting swap agreements to fix LIBOR at   1.83%   for the entire term of the loan. The term loan was obtained in October 2015, however, funding was delayed until January 2016 in connection with the acquisition of the Hotel Commonwealth.  
  Additionally, in January 2016, the Company obtained a $60 million mortgage loan with an interest rate of LIBOR plus 260 basis points and maturing in January 2023. Simultaneously with the closing of the mortgage, the Company entered into an interest rate swap to fix the interest rate at   4.14%   for the remaining term of the loan. 
  In February 2016, we refinanced one mortgage loan to fix the interest rate at 4.53% and extend maturity to March 2026. Additional proceeds of approximately $11 million were received under the refinanced terms of the mortgage, which increased the principal of the loan from approximately $49 million to $60 million. 
  In March 2016, we elected to exercise our right under the terms of one of our mortgage loan to extend the maturity date to March 2017. 
  In August 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a   $41.0 million   mortgage loan to fix the interest rate at   2.98%   for the remaining term of the loan. 
  Also in August 2016, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a   $38.0 million   mortgage loan to fix the interest rate at   2.99%   for the remaining term of the loan. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we paid off three hotel mortgage loans totaling   $147.0 million   with proceeds from asset sales and cash on hand.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our outstanding debt was   $1,176 million   and had a weighted average interest rate of   3.39%  . 
   
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  Our principal sources of cash are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under debt financings, including draws on our revolving credit facility. We may also obtain cash from various types of equity offerings or the sale of our hotels. Our principal uses of cash are asset acquisitions, capital investments, routine debt service and debt repayments, operating costs, corporate expenses and dividends.  We may also elect to use cash to buy back our common stock under the Repurchase Program.

Comparison of the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   to the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015    
  The table below presents summary cash flow information for the combined condensed consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):      

  Operating  
             
    Cash provided by operating activities was   $172.6   million and   $141.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased due to (i) the non-recurring separation and other start-up related expenses of   $26.9 million   that were incurred in 2015 related to our separation from InvenTrust and (ii) an increase in cash flows generated from our hotel portfolio including cash flows generated by the three hotels acquired in July 2015, the two hotel developments that began operations in the third and fourth quarter of 2015, and the acquisition of the Hotel Commonwealth in January 2016.  These increases were offset by lost operating cash flow attributable to the sale of one hotel in October 2015 and five hotels during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
     Investing  
             
    Cash used investing activities was   $2.2   million and   $331.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   and   2015  , respectively.  Cash provided by investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily due to   proceeds of   $161.1 million   from the sale of five hotels in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which was offset by cash used in investing activities for (i)   $38.1 million   in capital improvements at our hotel properties and   (ii) the acquisition of the Hotel Commonwealth for net cash at closing of $116 million.    Cash used in investing activities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was primarily due to capital improvements at our hotels and two development properties and the initial deposit on the acquisition of the Hotel Commonwealth. 
     Financing 
             
    Cash used in financing activities was   $107.2   million and cash provided by financing was   $126.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively.  Cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was primarily comprised of (i) cash used for mortgage principal payments of   $4.4 million  , (ii) the payoff of   $147.0 million   in mortgage loans, (iii)   $66.3 million   used to repurchase common shares under the Repurchase Program and (iv) the payment of   $85.3 million   in dividends to common stockholders and Operating Partnership unit holders, which was partially offset (v) by proceeds from mortgage debt of   $71.3 million   and the   $125 million   funding of the term loan in January 2016.  Cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was primarily comprised of (i) a net contribution of $153.3 million from InvenTrust, (ii) net borrowings on our revolving credit facility of $117 million, (iii) and proceeds from mortgage debt of   $19.6 million  , which was partially offset by (iv) cash used for mortgage principal payments of   $6.7 million  , (v) the payoff of   $81.5 million   in mortgage loans, (vi)   $36.9 million   related to the repurchase of common shares in the Tender Offer and (vii)   $42.2 million   dividends to common stockholders. 
      
  Capital Expenditures and Reserve Funds 
  We maintain each of our properties in good repair and condition and in conformity with applicable laws and regulations, franchise agreements and management agreements. Routine capital expenditures are administered by the property management companies. However, we have approval rights over the capital expenditures as part of the annual budget process for each of our properties. From time to time, certain of our hotels may be undergoing renovations as a result of our decision to upgrade portions of the hotels, such as guest rooms, public space, meeting space and/or restaurants, in order to better compete with other hotels in our markets. In addition, upon the acquisition of a hotel we often are required to complete a property improvement plan in order to bring the hotel up to the respective brand standards. If permitted by the terms of the management agreement, funding for a renovation will first come from the furniture, fixtures and equipment reserves. We are obligated to maintain reserve funds with respect to certain agreements with our hotel management companies, franchisors and lenders to provide  
  
   36 

funds, generally 3% to 5% of hotel revenues, sufficient to cover the cost of certain capital improvements to the hotels and to periodically replace and update furniture, fixtures and equipment. Certain of the agreements require that we reserve this cash in separate accounts. To the extent that the furniture, fixtures and equipment reserves are not available or adequate to cover the cost of the renovation, we may fund a portion of the renovation with cash on hand, borrowings from our unsecured revolving credit facility and/or other sources of available liquidity. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held a total of   $71.6 million   and   $65.7 million  , respectively, of furniture, fixtures and equipment reserves. We have been and will continue to be prudent with respect to our capital spending, taking into account our cash flows from operations.   
  During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we made total capital expenditures of $17.3 million and   $38.1 million  . During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we made total capital expenditures of $9.9 million and  $40.9 million, including $2.7 million for Napa hotel earthquake repairs.  
   
  Contractual Obligations 
  The table below presents, on a combined consolidated basis, obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt obligations (including interest) and lease agreements as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Includes principal and interest payments, for both variable and fixed rate loans. The variable rate interest payments were calculated based upon the variable rate spread plus 1 month LIBOR as of   September 30, 2016  . 
      
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We consider the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of our operating performance: EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO.  These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income or loss, operating profit, cash from operations, or any other operating performance measure as prescribed per GAAP.  
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA 
  EBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries and is defined as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP) excluding interest expense, provision for income taxes (including income taxes applicable to sale of assets) and depreciation and amortization.  We consider EBITDA useful to an investor regarding our results of operations, in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of our operating performance between periods and between REITs by removing the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense) and asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization) from our operating results, even though EBITDA does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common stockholders.  In addition, EBITDA is used as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions and along with FFO and Adjusted FFO, it is used by management in the annual budget process for compensation programs. We present EBITDA attributable to common stock and unit holders, which includes our Operating Partnership units because our Operating Partnership units may be redeemed for common stock.  We believe it is meaningful for the investor to understand EBITDA attributable to all common stock and Operating Partnership units. 
  We further adjust EBITDA for certain additional items such as hotel property acquisitions and pursuit costs, amortization of share-based compensation, equity investment adjustments, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, impairment of real estate assets, operating results from properties sold and other costs we believe do not represent recurring operations and are not indicative of the performance of our underlying hotel property entities.  We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with another financial measure in evaluating and facilitating comparison of operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures. 
  
   37 

FFO and Adjusted FFO 
  We calculate FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT), which defines FFO as net income or loss (calculated in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation, amortization and impairments, gains (losses) from sales of real estate, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, and items classified by GAAP as extraordinary. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most industry investors consider presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves.  We believe that the presentation of FFO provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our operating performance by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and amortization, gains (losses) from sales for real estate, impairments of real estate assets, extraordinary items and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities, all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance.  We believe that the presentation of FFO can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between REITs, even though FFO does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common stockholders. Our calculation of FFO may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the NAREIT definition of FFO or do not calculate FFO per diluted share in accordance with NAREIT guidance.  Additionally, FFO may not be helpful when comparing us to non-REITs.  We present FFO attributable to common stock and unit holders, which includes our Operating Partnership units because our Operating Partnership units may be redeemed for common stock.  We believe it is meaningful for the investor to understand FFO attributable to all common stock and Operating Partnership units. 
  We further adjust FFO for certain additional items that are not in NAREIT s definition of FFO such as hotel property acquisition and pursuit costs, amortization of debt origination costs and share-based compensation, operating results from properties that are sold and other expenses we believe do not represent recurring operations.  We believe that Adjusted FFO provides investors with useful supplemental information that may facilitate comparisons of ongoing operating performance between periods and between REITs that make similar adjustments to FFO and is beneficial to investors  complete understanding of our operating performance.

The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we terminated management agreements for four properties and entered into new management contracts with a new third-party hotel operator.  In connection with the terminations, we paid termination fees of $0.7 million, which was offset by $0.5 million in income from the write off of deferred guaranty payments that were previously received from certain of the managers and were being recognized over the term of the old management contracts. 
              (2) 
    The business interruption insurance proceeds received during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   $0.4 million   and   $2.5 million  , which is net of $0.1 million and $1.6 million of hotel related expenses attributable to those hotels impacted by the August 2014 Napa Earthquake. 
              (3) 
    For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , other non-recurring expenses include one-time costs related to the listing of our common stock on the NYSE, such as legal, audit fees and other professional fees, costs related to a tender offer and other start-up costs incurred while transitioning to a stand-alone, publicly-traded company.

The following is a reconciliation of our GAAP net income to FFO and Adjusted FFO for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands):   
   
           (1)  
    Loan related costs included amortization of debt discounts, premiums and deferred loan origination costs. 
              (2) 
    For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we terminated management agreements for four properties and entered into new management contracts with a new third-party hotel operator.  In connection with the terminations, we paid termination fees of $0.7 million, which was offset by $0.5 million in income from the write off of deferred guaranty payments that were previously received from certain of the managers and were being recognized over the term of the old management contracts. 
              (3) 
    For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized income tax expense of which $1.9 million related to a gain on the transfer of a hotel between legal entities resulting in a more optimal structure in connection with the Company s intention to elect to be taxed as a REIT 
              (4) 
    The business interruption insurance recovery proceeds received during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was   $0.4 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively, which was net of $0.1 million and $1.6 million of hotel related expenses attributable to those hotels impacted by the August 2014 Napa Earthquake. 
              (5) 
    For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , other non-recurring expenses include one-time costs related to the listing of our common stock on the NYSE, such as legal, audit fees and other professional fees, costs related to a tender offer and other start-up costs incurred while transitioning to a stand-alone, publicly-traded company.

Use and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO, and Adjusted FFO do not represent cash generated from operating activities under GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income or loss, operating profit, cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by GAAP.  Although we present and use EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, FFO and Adjusted FFO because we believe they are useful to investors in evaluating and facilitating comparisons of our operating performance between periods and between REITs that report similar measures, the use of these non-GAAP measures has certain limitations as analytical tools.  These non-GAAP financial measures are not measures of our liquidity, nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to fund capital expenditures, contractual commitments, working capital, service debt or make cash distributions.  These measurements do not reflect cash expenditures for long-term assets and other items that we have incurred and will incur.  These non-GAAP financial measures may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures, property acquisitions, and other commitments and uncertainties.  These non-GAAP financial measures as presented may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures as calculated by other real estate companies.  
  We compensate for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance.  Our reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP financial measures, and our   combined condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  , include interest expense, and other excluded items, all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance, as well as the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures.  These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional ways of viewing our operations that we believe, when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent this disclosure.  We strongly encourage investors to review our financial information in its entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual amounts may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions.  We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable and appropriate on an ongoing basis, based on information that is then available to us as well as our experience and various matters.  All of our significant accounting policies, including certain critical accounting policies, are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and Note 2 in the combined condensed consolidated financial statements included herein. 
   
  Inflation 
  We rely on the performance of the hotels to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation.  Generally, our hotel operators possess the ability to adjust room rates daily, except for group or corporate rates contractually committed to in advance, although competitive pressures may limit the ability of our operators to raise rates faster than inflation or even at the same rate. 
  Seasonality 
  Demand in the lodging industry is affected by recurring seasonal patterns which are greatly influenced by overall economic cycles, the geographic locations of the hotels and the customer mix at the hotels.  Generally, our hotels will have lower revenue, operating income and cash flow in the first quarter and higher revenue, operating income and cash flow in the third quarter. 
   
  Subsequent Events  
  In October 2016, the Company elected its prepayment option under the terms of   three   hotel mortgage loans, which had maturities in 2016 and 2017, and repaid the outstanding balances and accrued interest totaling   $130.7 million  .  In addition to these repayments, the Company modified two mortgage loans, which resulted in   $41 million   of additional proceeds, and extended the maturity dates to January 2022.  
  Subsequent to quarter end and as of November 4, 2016, the Company repurchased an additional   402,715   shares for an aggregate purchase price of   $6.2 million  .  A total of   4,868,763   shares have been repurchased, at a weighted average price of   $14.88   per share, for total consideration of approximately   $72.5 million   as of November 4, 2016.  
  In November 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional   $75 million   of the Company's outstanding common shares.  Repurchases may be made in open market, in privately-negotiated transactions or by other means, including Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  This repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time, and does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of shares.  Inclusive of this additional authorization, the Company had approximately   $102.5 million   remaining under its total repurchase authorization as of November 4, 2016.

New Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Implemented 
  See Note 2 to our combined condensed consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information related to recently issued accounting pronouncements.  
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are subject to market risk associated with changes in interest rates both in terms of variable-rate debt and the price of new fixed-rate debt upon maturity of existing debt and for acquisitions.  Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs.  If market rates of interest on all of the variable rate debt as of   September 30, 2016   permanently increased or decreased by 1%, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease or increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $5.0 million per annum.  If market rates of interest on all of the variable rate debt as of December 31, 2015 permanently increased or decreased by 1%, the increase or decrease in interest expense on the variable rate debt would decrease or increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately $5.8 million per annum. 
  With regard to our variable rate financing, we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities.  We maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow risk attributable to both of our outstanding or forecasted debt obligations as well as our potential offsetting hedge positions.  The risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques, including cash flow sensitivity analysis, to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows.  
  We monitor interest rate risk using a variety of techniques, including periodically evaluating fixed interest rate quotes on all variable rate debt and the costs associated with converting the debt to fixed rate debt.  Also, existing fixed and variable rate loans that are scheduled to mature in the next year or two are evaluated for possible early refinancing or extension due to consideration given to current interest rates. We have taken significant steps in reducing our variable rate debt exposure by paying off property-level mortgage debt and entering into various interest rate swap agreements to hedge the interest rate exposure risk related to several variable rate loans. Refer to Note   7   in the combined consolidated financial statements included herein, for our debt principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year and expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes. Refer to Note   8   in the combined consolidated financial statements included herein for more information on our interest rate swap derivatives. 
  We may continue to use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates on loans secured by our properties. To the extent we do, we are exposed to credit risk and market risk.  Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We maintain credit policies with regard to our counterparties that we believe reduce overall credit risk. These policies include evaluating and monitoring our counterparties' financial condition, including their credit ratings, and entering into agreements with counterparties based on established credit limit policies. Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument that results from a change in interest rates. The market risk associated with interest-rate contracts is managed by establishing and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.    As required by Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer evaluated, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act.  Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, were effective at a reasonable assurance level for the purpose of ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in this quarterly report is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.    There has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
  
   44 

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.  Legal Proceedings 
  We are involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings involving tort and other general liability claims, workers  compensation and other employee claims and claims related to our ownership of certain hotel properties.  Most occurrences involving liability, claims of negligence and employees are covered by insurance with solvent insurance carriers.  We recognize a liability when we believe the loss is probable and reasonably estimable.  We currently believe that the ultimate outcome of such lawsuits and proceedings will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on our combined condensed consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in response to Item 1A. to Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Exhibit 31.1 
  Certification of Chief Executive Officer Pursuant to Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
  I, Marcel Verbaas, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   of Xenia Hotels   Resorts, Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
