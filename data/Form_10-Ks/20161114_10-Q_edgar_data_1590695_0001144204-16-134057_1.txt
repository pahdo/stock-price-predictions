TWINLAB CONSOLIDATED HOLDINGS, INC.  

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)  

  (AMOUNTS IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT SHARE AND
PER SHARE AMOUNTS)  

NOTE 1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Organization  

 Twinlab Consolidated Holdings, Inc. (the  Company )
was incorporated on October 24, 2013 under the laws of the State of Nevada as Mirror Me, Inc. On August 7, 2014, the Company amended
its articles of incorporation and changed its name to Twinlab Consolidated Holdings, Inc. 

Nature of Operations  

The Company is an integrated manufacturer, marketer, distributor
and retailer of branded nutritional supplements and other natural products sold to and through domestic health and natural food
stores, mass market retailers, specialty stores retailers, on-line retailers and websites. Internationally, we market and distribute
branded nutritional supplements and other natural products to and through health and natural product distributors and retailers. 

Our products include vitamins, minerals, specialty supplements
and sports nutrition products primarily under the Twinlab  brand (including the Twinlab  Fuel family of sports nutrition
products) and Reserveage  nutrition brand ResVitale  brand name. We also manufacture and sell diet and energy products
under the Metabolife  brand name and Re-Body  brand name, a line of products that promote joint health under the Trigosamine 
brand name, and a full line of herbal teas under the Alvita  brand name. These products are sold primarily through health
and natural food stores and national and regional drug store chains, supermarkets, and mass-market retailers. 

The Company also performs contract manufacturing services
for private label products. The  contract manufacturing business involves the manufacture of custom products to
the specifications of a customer who requires finished product under the customer s own brand name.  We do not
market these products as our business is to manufacture and sell the products to the customer, who then markets and sells
the products to retailers or end consumers. 

Principles of Consolidation  

 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Basis of Presentation and Unaudited Information  

 The condensed consolidated interim financial statements included
herein have been prepared by the Company in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles, without audit,
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have
been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate
to make the information presented not misleading. These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments,
which in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein. Financial results
for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of financial results that may be expected for the fiscal year. The unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on April
14, 2016. 

Use of Estimates  

 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts
and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant management estimates include those with respect
to returns and allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, reserves for inventory obsolescence, the recoverability of long-lived
assets and the estimated value of warrants and derivative liabilities. 

Revenue Recognition  

 Revenue from product sales, net of estimated returns and allowances,
is recognized when evidence of an arrangement is in place, related prices are fixed and determinable, contractual obligations have
been satisfied, title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably
assured. Shipping terms are generally freight on board shipping point. The Company sells predominately in the North American and
European markets, with international sales transacted in U.S. dollars. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

 The Company applies the following fair value hierarchy, which
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the
lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement: 

Level 1   inputs are quoted prices in active
markets for identical assets that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2   inputs are other than quoted prices
included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset, either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3   inputs are unobservable inputs for
the asset that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the underlying asset
or liability. 

The following table summarizes the financial instruments of
the Company measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Accounts Receivable and Allowances  

  The Company grants credit to customers and generally does not require collateral
or other security. The Company performs credit evaluations of its customers and provides for expected claims related to promotional
items; customer discounts; shipping shortages; damages; and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt and claims experience.
As of September 30, 2016, total allowances amounted to $2,219, of which $375 was related to doubtful accounts. As of December 31,
2015, total allowance amounted to $1,494, of which $253 was related to doubtful accounts. 

Inventories  

 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs
are determined using the weighted average cost method, and are reduced by an estimated reserve for obsolete inventory. 

Value of Warrants Issued With Debt  

 The Company estimates the grant date value of certain
warrants issued with debt, using an outside professional valuation firm, which uses  the  Monte
Carlo option lattice model. The Company records  the amounts as interest expense or debt discount, depending on the terms of
the agreement. These estimates involve multiple inputs and assumptions, including the market price of
the Company s common stock, stock price volatility and other assumptions to project earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and other reset events. These inputs and assumptions are
subject to management s judgment and can vary materially from period to period.  

Derivative Liabilities  

 The Company has recorded  certain warrants as derivative
liabilities at estimated fair value, as determined based on the Company s use of an outside professional valuation
firm, due to the variable terms of the warrant agreements.  The value of the derivative liabilities
is generally estimated using the Monte Carlo option lattice model with multiple inputs and assumptions, including the market
price of the Company s common stock, stock price volatility and other assumptions to project EBITDA and other reset
events. These inputs and assumptions are subject to management s judgment and can vary materially from period to
period.  

Deferred gain on sale of assets  

 The Company entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement relating
to its office facilities in 2013. Under the terms of the arrangement, the Company sold an office building and surrounding land
and then leased the property back under a 15-year operating lease. The Company recorded a deferred gain for the amount of the
gain on the sale of the asset, to be recognized as a reduction of rent expense over the life of the lease. Accordingly, the Company
recorded amortization of deferred gain as a reduction of rental expense of $41 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded  amortization
of $122 . As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, unamortized deferred gain on sale of assets was $1,768 and $1,890,
respectively. 

Net Income (Loss) per Common Share  

 Basic net income or loss per common share (Basic EPS) is computed
by dividing net income or loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income or loss per common
share (Diluted EPS) is computed by dividing net income or loss by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
and the dilutive potential common share equivalents then outstanding. Potential dilutive common share equivalents consist of total
shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants to acquire common stock using the treasury stock method
and the average market price per share during the period. 

The common shares used in the computation of our basic and diluted
net income (loss) per share are reconciled as follows: 

Significant Concentration of Credit Risk  

 Sales to the Company s top three customers aggregated
to 25% and 37% of total sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 26% and 33% of total sales
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales to one of those customers were 11% and 18% of total
sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 11% and 23% of total sales for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accounts receivable from these customers were 39% and 30% of total accounts receivable
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Reclassifications  

 Certain amounts in the 2015 consolidated financial statements
have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The amendments in this ASU
revise the accounting related to lessee accounting. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
and a right-of-use asset for all leases. The new lease guidance also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions
primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public
companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and are to be applied through a modified retrospective transition
approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
statements. Early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements of the
adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Stock
Compensation (Topic 718) , which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award
transactions, including the income tax impacts, the classification on the statement of cash flows, and forfeitures. The amendments
in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods. We have not yet determined
the impact on our consolidated financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230) , which clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of
cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods. We do not expect the new guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements or
related disclosures. 

Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements
issued or proposed by the FASB, which the Company has adopted or will adopt, as applicable, we do not believe any of these accounting
pronouncements has had or will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes continuity of operations and realization of assets and
liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Since its formation, the Company has generated losses from operations. At
September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $215,203. These losses were associated with start-up activities
and brand infrastructure development. Recently, losses are primarily attributable to lower than planned sales resulting from
low fill rates on demand due to working capital limitations, delayed product introductions and postponed marketing
activities as well as restructuring costs and interest. Losses have been funded primarily through issuance of common stock,
borrowings from our stockholders and third-party debt. 

Because of this history of operating losses, significant interest
expense on the Company s debt, and the recording of significant derivative liabilities, the Company has a working capital
deficiency of $1,719 at September 30, 2016. The Company also has $8,874 of debt, net of discount, due within the next 12 months.
These continuing conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management has addressed operating issues through the following
actions: focusing on growing the core business and brands; continuing emphasis on major customers and key products; reducing manufacturing
and operating costs and continuing to negotiate lower prices from major suppliers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company obtained debt funding totaling $24,678 to fund current operations. Additionally, in connection with the July 2016 promissory
note agreements with two of the Company s related party lenders, the Company may make draw requests and the lenders may loan
the Company up to an additional principal amount of $4,362. However, the Company believes that it may need additional capital to
execute its business plan. If additional funding is required, there can be no assurance that sources of funding will be available
when needed on acceptable terms or at all. 

NOTE 3   INVENTORIES  

Inventories consisted of the following at: 

NOTE 4   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT  

Property and equipment consisted of the following at: 

Assets held under capital leases are included in machinery and
equipment and amounted to $1,390 and $1,737 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Depreciation and amortization expense totaled $221 and $122
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and totaled $567 and $366 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 5   INTANGIBLE ASSETS  

Intangible assets consisted of the following at: 

Trademarks are amortized over periods ranging from 3 to 30 years,
customer relationships are amortized over periods ranging from 15 to 16 years, and other intangible assets are amortized over 3
years. Amortization expense was $557 and $204 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was $1,645
and $584 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 6   DEBT  

Debt consisted of the following at: 

Related-Party Debt  

July 2014 Note Payable Little Harbor, LLC  

 Pursuant to a July 2014 Debt Repayment Agreement with Little
Harbor, LLC ( Little Harbor ), an entity owned by certain stockholders of the Company, the Company is obligated to
pay such party $4,900 per year in structured monthly payments for 3 years provided that such payment obligations will terminate
at such earlier time as the trailing ninety day volume weighted average closing sales price of the Company s common stock
on all domestic securities exchanges on which such stock is listed equals or exceeds $5.06 per share. This note is unsecured and
matures on July 25, 2017. This note is non-interest bearing, accordingly, using an imputed interest rate of 16.2%, the Company
recorded a note discount in July 2014, which is being amortized into interest expense based on the effective interest rate method
over the term of the note. 

July 2016 Note Payable Little Harbor, LLC  

 On July 21, 2016, the Company issued an Unsecured Delayed Draw
Promissory Note in favor of Little Harbor, pursuant to which Little Harbor may, in its sole discretion and pursuant to draw requests
made by the Company, loan the Company up to the maximum principal amount of $4,770. This note is unsecured and matures on January
28, 2019. This note bears interest at an annual rate of 8.5%, with the principal payable at maturity. If Little Harbor, in its
discretion, accepts a draw request made by the Company under this note, Little Harbor shall not transfer cash to the Company, but
rather Little Harbor shall irrevocably agree to accept the principal amount of any monthly delayed draw under this note in lieu
and in complete satisfaction of the obligation of THI to make an equivalent dollar amount of periodic cash payments otherwise due

Company. The Little Harbor July 2016 Warrant grants Little Harbor certain registration rights for the shares of Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of the Little Harbor July 2016 Warrant. 

NOTE 8   DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  

The number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to
certain warrants issued in 2015 will be increased if the Company s adjusted EBITDA or the market price of the
Company s common stock do not meet certain defined amounts. The Company has recorded the estimated fair value of the
warrants as of the date of issuance. Due to the variable terms of the warrant agreements, changes in the estimated fair value
of the warrants from the date of issuance to each balance sheet reporting date are recorded as derivative liabilities with a
corresponding charge to our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss). As of September 30, 2016, the
Company has estimated the total fair value of the derivative liabilities to be $2,988 as compared to $33,091 as of December
31, 2015. Accordingly, the Company recorded a gain on change in derivative liabilities of $14,065 and $28,128 for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The Company had the following activity in
its derivative liabilities account since December 31, 2015:  

The value of the derivative liabilities
is generally estimated using an options lattice model with multiple inputs and assumptions, including the market price of the Company s
common stock, stock price volatility and other assumptions to project EBITDA and other reset events. These inputs and assumptions
are subject to management s judgment and can vary materially from period to period. 

NOTE 9   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY (DEFICIT)  

Preferred Stock  

 The Company has authorized 500,000,000 shares of preferred stock
with a par value of $0.001 per share. No shares of the preferred stock have been issued. 

Twinlab Consolidation Corporation 2013 Stock Incentive Plan  

 The only equity compensation plan currently in effect is the
Twinlab Consolidation Corporation 2013 Stock Incentive Plan (the  TCC Plan ), which was assumed by the Company on September
16, 2014. The TCC Plan originally established a pool of 20,000,000 shares of common stock for issuance as incentive awards to employees
for the purposes of attracting and retaining qualified employees who will aid in the success of the Company. From January through
December 2015, the Company granted Restricted Stock Units to certain employees of the Company pursuant to the TCC Plan. Each Restricted
Stock Unit relates to one share of the Company s common stock. The Restricted Stock Unit awards vest 25% each annually on
various dates through 2019. The Company estimated the grant date fair market value per share of the Restricted Stock Units and
is amortizing the total estimated grant date value over the vesting periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a
total of 822,890 shares of common stock were issued to employees pursuant to the vesting of Restricted Stock Units. As of September
30, 2016, 6,878,520 shares remain available for use in the TCC Plan. 

Separation and Release Agreement  

 The employment of Thomas A. Tolworthy as President and Chief
Executive Officer of the Company was terminated by the Company on March 16, 2016. On March 23, 2016, the Company and Mr. Tolworthy
entered into a Separation and Release Agreement (the  Separation Agreement ). Pursuant to the Separation Agreement,
the Company purchased from Mr. Tolworthy 35,551,724 shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate price of $500. 

In connection with the Separation Agreement, Mr. Tolworthy also
surrendered 9,306,898 shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to that certain Surrender Agreement between Mr. Tolworthy
and the Company, dated September 3, 2014. 

Treasury Stock  

 In March 2016, the Company purchased an aggregate of 38,111,112
shares of its common stock from former employees. These repurchases included (a) the purchase of 2,559,388 unvested restricted
shares previously acquired by employees under the TCC Plan for total cash consideration of $1 (equal to the employees  original
purchase price), and (b) the purchase, as referenced immediately above, of 35,551,724 shares from Thomas A. Tolworthy for total
cash consideration of $500. In addition, and as referenced immediately above, Mr. Tolworthy surrendered 9,306,898 shares to the
Company during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 pursuant to contractual agreements between him and the Company. All such
repurchased and surrendered shares, amounting to 47,418,010 shares, have been placed in treasury. 

Warrant Exercises  

 As discussed in Note 7, the Company issued JL warrants to purchase
an aggregate of 2,329,400 shares of the Company s common stock, at an aggregate exercise price of $0.01, through February
13, 2020. These warrants were ultimately assigned to two individuals. On February 4, 2016, one individual exercised warrants to
acquire a total of 930,538 shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $0. On February 4, 2016,
another individual exercised warrants to acquire a total of 257,457 shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate
purchase price of $0. 

As discussed in Note 7, warrants were exercised for a total
of 1,697,136 shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $1, including the warrant exercises
discussed in the paragraph above and warrants exercised by Golisano LLC for a total of 509,141 shares of the Company s common
stock. 

Stock Subscription Receivable and Loss on Stock Price
Guarantee   

At September 30, 2016, the stock subscription receivable dated
August 1, 2014 for the purchase of 1,528,384 shares of the Company s common stock had a principal balance of $30 and bears
interest at an annual rate of 5%. 

On August 6, 2016, the 18-month anniversary of the closing of
a share purchase agreement, the Company must pay the purchaser of the common stock the difference between $2.29 per share and either
a defined market price or a price per share determined by a valuation firm acceptable to both parties. Based on an outside professional
valuation performed on the company s common stock, the Company estimated the stock price guarantee payment to be $3,210.
Accordingly, the Company recorded a loss on the stock purchase price guarantee of $3,210 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and a corresponding liability for the same amount as of September 30, 2016, which is included in accrued expenses and
other current liabilities in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of the filing date of this Form 10-Q, the
Company has not yet paid the liability to the purchaser and the Company is negotiating with the purchaser on extending the payment
date. The Company cannot provide any assurance that it will be successful in negotiating an extension of the payment date. If the
Company is not successful, the purchaser may sue the company for breach of contract. 

Item 2.      Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.     ( Amounts in
thousands, except share and per share amounts and number of employees)   

Overview  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
statements. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). The words
 believes,   anticipates,   plans,   expects,   intends  and similar
expressions identify some of the forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of performance or future
results and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. The factors discussed elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and in subsequent Quarterly
Reports on Form 10-Q and Annual Reports on Form 10-K, could also cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated
by the Company s forward-looking statements. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking
statements. 

Our Operations  

We are an integrated
manufacturer, marketer, distributor and retailer of branded nutritional supplements and other natural products sold to and through
domestic health and natural food stores, mass market retailers, specialty stores retailers, on-line retailers and websites. Internationally,
we market and distribute branded nutritional supplements and other natural products to and through health and natural product
distributors and retailers. 

Our products include vitamins, minerals, specialty supplements
and sports nutrition products primarily under the Twinlab  brand (including the Twinlab  Fuel family of sports nutrition
products) and Reserveage  nutrition brand ResVitale  brand name. We also manufacture and sell diet and energy products
under the Metabolife  brand name and Re-Body  brand name, a line of products that promote joint health under the Trigosamine 
brand name, and a full line of herbal teas under the Alvita  brand name. These products are sold primarily through health
and natural food stores and national and regional drug store chains, supermarkets, and mass-market retailers. 

We also perform contract manufacturing services for private
label products.  Our contract manufacturing business involves the manufacture of custom products to the specifications of
a customer who requires finished product under the customer s own brand name.  We do not market these products as our
business is to manufacture and sell the products to the customer, who then markets and sells the products to retailers or end consumers. 

We manufacture and/or distribute one of the broadest branded
product lines in the industry with approximately 550 stock keeping units, or SKUs, including approximately 250 SKUs sold internationally.
We believe that as a result of our emphasis on innovation, quality, loyalty, education and customer service, our brands are widely
recognized in health and natural food stores and among their customers. 

We focused significantly in 2015 on successfully obtaining funding
for and completing two acquisitions which form the foundation for our consolidation and growth strategy. The first was the acquisition
of the customer relationships of Nutricap Labs, LLC ( Nutricap ), a provider of dietary supplement contract manufacturing
services, into our subsidiary, NutraScience, on February 6, 2015, and the second was the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests
of Organic Holdings, LLC ( Organic Holdings ), a market leader in the healthy aging and beauty from within categories
and owner of the award-winning Reserveage  Nutrition brand. Consequently, the results of our operations for the three months
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 generally will not be comparable to the results of our operations for the three months
and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Going Concern Uncertainty  

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes continuity of operations and realization of assets and
liabilities in the ordinary course of business. Since our formation, we have generated losses from operations. At September
30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $215,203. These losses were associated with start-up activities and brand
infrastructure development. Recently, losses are primarily attributable to lower than planned sales resulting from low fill
rates on demand due to working capital limitations, delayed product introductions and postponed marketing activities as well
as restructuring costs and interest. Losses have been funded primarily through issuance of common stock, borrowings from our
stockholders and third-party debt. 

Because of this history of operating losses, significant interest
expense on our debt, and the recording of significant derivative liabilities, we have a working capital deficiency of $1,719 at
September 30, 2016. We also have significant debt due within the next 12 months. These continuing conditions raise substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Management has addressed operating issues through the following
actions: focusing on growing the core business and brands; continuing emphasis on major customers and key products; reducing manufacturing
and operating costs and continuing to negotiate lower prices from major suppliers. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
we obtained debt funding totaling $24,678 to fund current operations. Additionally, in connection with the July 2016 promissory
note agreements with two related-party lenders, pursuant to draw requests we made, the lenders may loan us up to an additional
principal amount of $4,362. It is possible that we may need additional capital to execute our business plan. If additional funding
is required, there can be no assurance that sources of funding will be available when needed on acceptable terms or at all. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and
results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with the
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of our financial statements required us to make estimates and assumptions
that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of
the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Significant estimates
include values and lives assigned to acquired intangible assets, reserves for customer returns and allowances, uncollectible accounts
receivable, valuation adjustments for slow moving, obsolete and/or damaged inventory and valuation, recoverability of long-lived
assets, estimated values of stock options and warrants, share-based compensation, and the identification and valuation of derivatives.
Actual results may differ from these estimates. 

Our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following: 

Revenue Recognition  

 Revenue from product sales, net of estimated returns and allowances,
is recognized when evidence of an arrangement is in place, related prices are fixed and determinable, contractual obligations have
been satisfied, title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably
assured. Shipping terms are generally freight on board shipping point. We sell predominately in the North American and European
markets, with international sales transacted in U.S. Dollars. 

Accounts Receivable and Allowances  

  We grant credit to customers and generally
do not require collateral or other security. We perform credit evaluations of our customers and provide for expected claims, related
to promotional items; customer discounts; shipping shortages and damages; and doubtful accounts based upon historical bad debt
and claims experience. 

Inventories  

 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Costs
are determined using the weighted average cost method, and are reduced by an estimated reserve for obsolete inventory. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

 Long-lived assets, including intangible assets subject to amortization,
are reviewed for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows of the asset, an impairment charge is recognized
equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. The testing of these intangibles under established guidelines
for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions. Changes in forecasted operations and other assumptions could
materially affect the estimated fair values. Changes in business conditions could potentially require adjustments to these asset
valuations. 

Goodwill  

 Goodwill is not amortized, but tested for impairment on an annual
basis at the end of our fiscal year and at an interim date if indicators of impairment exist. 

Income Taxes  

 We account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach.
Deferred income taxes are determined by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates to the cumulative temporary differences between
the carrying values of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes. Valuation allowances against deferred
tax assets are recorded when we are unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized. 

Value of Warrants Issued with Debt  

 We estimate the grant date value of certain warrants issued
with debt, using an outside professional valuation firm, which uses the Monte Carlo option lattice model.  We record the
amounts as interest expense or debt discount, depending on the terms of the agreement. These estimates involve multiple inputs and
assumptions, including the market price of the Company s common stock, stock price volatility and other assumptions to
project earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and other reset events. These
inputs and assumptions are subject to management s judgment and can vary materially from period to period. 

Derivative Liabilities  

 We have recorded certain warrants as derivative liabilities at
estimated fair value, as determined based on our use of an outside professional valuation firm,  due to the variable terms of
the warrant agreements. The value of the derivative liabilities is generally estimated using Monte Carlo option lattice model
with multiple inputs and assumptions, including the market price of the Company s common stock, stock price volatility
and other assumptions to project EBITDA and other reset events. These inputs and assumptions are subject to
management s judgment and can vary materially from period to period. 

Results of Operations  

Net Sales  

Our net sales increased $6,489, or 39%, to $23,046 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from $16,557 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a year-to-date basis, our net sales
increased $5,670, or 9%, to $65,885 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $60,215 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increases in our net sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the corresponding periods
of 2015 reflect the acquisition of Organic Holdings on October 5, 2015 and the acquisition of the Nutricap customer relationships
by NutraScience on February 6, 2015. Without the 2015 acquisitions, our net sales would have decreased for both the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 due in part to operating cash constraints and the decision to exit certain low margin, private
label contract manufacturing. 

Gross Profit  

Our gross profit increased $4,645, or 191%, to $7,083, for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2,438 for the three months September 30, 2015. On a year-to-date basis, our
gross profit increased $7,081, or 75%, to $16,480 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $9,399 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The increases in our gross profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
from the corresponding periods of 2015 reflect the gross profit contributed by our 2015 acquisitions. Without the 2015
acquisitions, our net gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the corresponding period of
2015 would still have increased primarily attributable to improved margins due to a strategic effort to eliminate low margin
business in 2016. Without the 2015 acquisitions, our net gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the corresponding period of 2015 would have decreased primarily because of decreased net sales as discussed
above. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $1,536,
or 25%, to $7,760 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $6,224 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a
year-to-date basis, our selling, general and administrative expenses increased $5,071, or 24%, to $26,249 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from $21,178 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increases in our selling, general and administrative
expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the corresponding periods of 2015 reflect incremental expenses
from our 2015 acquisitions. Without the 2015 acquisitions, our selling, general and administrative expenses would have decreased
primarily due to the Company s reduction in force to right-size the number of employees against the needs of current operations
on April 13, 2016. 

Loss on Stock Purchase Price Guarantee  

On August 6, 2016, the 18-month anniversary of the closing of
a share purchase agreement, we must pay the purchaser of the common stock the difference between $2.29 per share and either a defined
market price or a price per share determined by a valuation firm acceptable to both parties. Based on an outside professional valuation
performed on the company s common stock, we estimated the stock price guarantee payment to be $3,210. Accordingly, we recorded
a loss on the stock purchase price guarantee of $3,210 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and a corresponding liability
for the same amount as of September 30, 2016, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying
condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of the filing date of this Form 10-Q, we have not yet paid the liability to the purchaser
and we are negotiating with the purchaser on further extending the payment date. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be
successful in negotiating an extension of the payment date. If we are not successful, the purchaser may sue the company for breach
of contract. 

Interest Expense, Net  

Our interest expense increased $857, or 55%, to $2,423 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,566 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a year-to-date basis, our interest
expense increased $1,250, or 24%, to $6,530 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5,280 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense is due primarily to interest on new debt incurred in 2015 to complete the
Nutricap and Organic Holdings acquisitions and new debt incurred during the first nine months of 2016, including the amortization
of related debt discounts. 

Gain on Change in Derivative Liabilities  

The number of shares of common stock issuable pursuant to
certain warrants issued in 2015 will be increased if our audited adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization ( EBITDA ) or the market price of the Company s common stock do not meet certain defined
amounts. We have recorded the estimated fair value of the warrants as of the date of issuance. Due to the variable terms of
the warrant agreements, changes in the estimated fair value of the warrants from the date of issuance to each balance sheet
reporting date are recorded as derivative liabilities with a corresponding charge to our condensed consolidated statements of
comprehensive income (loss). During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we reported a gain on change in
derivative liabilities of $14,065 and $28,128, respectively. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we
reported a loss on change in derivative liabilities of $4,167 and $14,523, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

At September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $215,203,
primarily because of our history of operating losses and our recording of derivative liabilities and loss on stock purchase guarantee.
We have a working capital deficiency of $1,719 at September 30, 2016. Losses have been funded primarily through issuance of common
stock, borrowings from our stockholders and third-party debt and proceeds from the exercise of warrants. As of September 30, 2016,
we had cash of $3,045. On an ongoing basis, we also seek to improve operating cash through trade receivables and payables management
as well as inventory stocking levels. We used net cash in operating activities of $20,535 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred new debt of $24,678 and net increase in borrowings on our senior
credit facility of $3,342 to fund our operations and debt repayment of $5,562. 

Our total liabilities decreased by $4,960 from $86,471 at December
31, 2015 to $81,511 at September 30, 2016. This decrease in our total liabilities was primarily due to a decrease in our non-cash
derivative liabilities of $30,103 and liabilities related to operations of $3,119, partially offset by an increase of $3,210 in
liability on stock purchase guarantee and a net increase of $25,174 in debt, principally due to new debt financings obtained during
the first nine months of 2016. For discussion of our debt financings completed to date during 2016, see Notes 6 and 7 in the Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report. 

Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and
Financing Activities  

Net cash used in operating activities was $20,535 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as a result of our net income of $8,584, a non-cash gain on change in derivative liabilities of $28,128
as well as other non-cash expenses totaling $10,016 and an increase in net operating assets and liabilities of $11,007. By comparison,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $1,125 as a result of our net loss of $31,155,
a non-cash loss on change in derivative liabilities of $14,523, a non-cash gain on sale of intangible of $750 as well as other
non-cash expenses of $5,694 and a net decrease in net operating assets and liabilities of $10,563. See Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Cash Flows included in this Report for additional information. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $119, consisting of the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $6,495, consisting of cash paid in the Nutricap acquisition of $6,126 and the purchase
of property and equipment of $1,727, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of assets of $988 and cash provided by change in
restricted cash of $370. 

Net cash provided by financing activities was $22,459 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, primarily consisting of proceeds from the issuance of debt of $22,089, net borrowings of $3,342
under our revolving credit facilities, partially offset by repayment of debt of $2,973. Net cash provided by financing activities
was $8,923 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily consisting of proceeds from the exercise of warrants of $6,066,
proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $2,500, proceeds from the issuance of debt of $7,000, partially offset by repayment
of debt of $4,007 and net repayments under our revolving credit facilities and payment of debt issuance costs of $666. 

Ongoing Funding Requirements  

As set forth above, we have obtained $24,678 in debt financing to
date in 2016 to support operations. It is possible that we may need additional funding to enable us to fund our operating expenses
and capital expenditure requirements. 

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product
revenues, we intend to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic
alliances and licensing arrangements. There can be no assurance that any of those sources of funding will be available when needed
on acceptable terms or at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities,
the ownership interests of existing stockholders will be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or
other preferences that adversely affect the rights of existing stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements
that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making
capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements
with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or
product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through
equity or debt financings or relationships with third parties when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to delay,
limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts; abandon our business strategy of growth
through acquisitions; or grant rights to develop and market product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market
ourselves. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The amendments in this ASU
revise the accounting related to lessee accounting. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability
and a right-of-use asset for all leases. The new lease guidance also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions
primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public
companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and are to be applied through a modified retrospective transition
approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial
statements. Early adoption is permitted. We have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial statements of the
adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Stock
Compensation (Topic 718) , which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award
transactions, including the income tax impacts, the classification on the statement of cash flows, and forfeitures. The amendments
in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods. We have not yet determined
the impact on our consolidated financial statements of the adoption of this new accounting pronouncement. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement
of Cash Flows (Topic 230) , which clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of
cash flows. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017, including interim periods. We do not expect the new guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements or
related disclosures. 

Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued
or proposed by the FASB, which we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable, we do not believe any of these accounting pronouncements
has had or will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

Material Contractual Obligations  

As of September 30, 2016, we have total
debt of $54,599, of which $36,502 is considered to be related-party debt. For discussion of our debt financings, see Notes 6 and
7 in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Report.

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.  

This item is not applicable as we are currently
considered a smaller reporting company. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2016 pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act. The term  disclosure controls and procedures, 
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s
rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated
and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate
to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2016, our management concluded that, as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial
reporting, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.  

In performing this evaluation, management identified certain deficiencies
relating to information technology general controls (including access to programs and data, program changes, data backups), segregation
of duties, review and approval, and verification procedures. 

Based on its assessment, our management concluded that, as of September
30, 2016, the design of our system of internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the deficiencies identified.
However, management believes that the identified weaknesses have not affected our ability to present financial statements in compliance
with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in this Form 10-Q. During the quarterly financial statement
close we were able to recognize and adjust our financial records to properly present our financial statements and we were therefore
able to present GAAP-compliant financial statements. Management does not believe that its weakness with respect to its procedures
and controls have had a pervasive effect upon our financial reporting and the overall control environment due to our ability to
make the necessary reconciling adjustments to our financial statements. 

Management s Remediation Initiatives  

Management plans and has initiated actions to implement a number
of initiatives to address the ineffective design of the system of internal control over financial reporting, including but not
limited to the following: 

Work closely with independent internal control consultants
to help improve the overall design of our system of internal control over financial reporting and promptly remediate any weaknesses
that may arise during next year s operations. 

Continue to evaluate control procedures on an ongoing
basis and, where possible, modify those control procedures to improve oversight. 

Continue to engage independent consultants to assist accounting
staff with processing transactions. 

We have already made various staff changes in 2016 in our
finance and accounting department and we believe that these changes will enable us to broaden the scope and quality of our
controls relating to the oversight and review of financial statements, to properly apply all relevant accounting policies and
to maintain optimal segregation of duties. Furthermore, we plan to implement and improve systems to automate certain financial
reporting processes and to improve information accuracy. 

Management will continue the process of implementing our new system
and reviewing existing controls, procedures and responsibilities to more closely identify financial reporting risks and the required
controls to address them. Key control and compensating control procedures will be developed to ensure that weaknesses are properly
addressed and related financial reporting risks are mitigated. Periodic control validation and testing will also be implemented
to ensure that controls continue to operate consistently and as designed. Management plans to complete this remediation process
as quickly as possible. Although we expect it will take at least a year, we cannot estimate how long it will take to remediate
the material weakness in our system of internal control over financial reporting. In addition, the remediation steps we have taken,
are taking and expect to take may not effectively remediate the material weakness, in which case our internal control over financial
reporting would continue to be ineffective. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to complete our remedial actions successfully.
Even if we are able to complete these actions successfully, these measures may not adequately address our material weakness and
may take more than a year to complete. In addition, it is possible that we will discover additional material weaknesses in our
internal control over financial reporting or that our existing material weakness will result in additional errors in or restatements
of our financial statements.  

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

Other than discussed above, there were no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during our most recent fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
and Procedures   

In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance
of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible
controls and procedures relative to their costs. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings  

Dennis Frisco v. Organics Management, LLC d/b/a Reserveage, Reserve
Life Organics, LLC d/b/a Reserveage, Wal-Staf Services, Inc., and Wal-Staf Temporary Services, Inc. , Case No: 01-2014-CA-000308
Div. J, in the Circuit Court of the Eighth Judicial Circuit in and for Alachua County, Florida. The plaintiff in this matter was
hired by our subsidiary, Organics Management, LLC, on a temporary basis through a third-party temporary staffing service to assist
with the hiring of sales people during a limited period of particularly high sales growth. As that period of unusual growth waned
and services for hiring sales people were no longer necessary for the needs of the business, Organics Management ended plaintiff s
temporary staffing engagement. Plaintiff alleges that Organics Management (or one of its affiliates) in fact intended to hire him
on a full-time basis and that their failure to do so was based on age and gender discrimination. We believe that plaintiff s
claims are without merit and are defending this case vigorously. 

In re: Herbal Supplements Marketing and Sales Practice Litigation,
MDL No. 2619, Case No. 1:15-cv-5070 , U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. We are not a party to this
matter, which joined in a multidistrict litigation a number of purported class actions arising from allegations raised by a state
attorney general claiming that DNA barcoding testing conducted on behalf the attorney general indicated that certain herbal supplement
products did not contain the herbal ingredients stated on the label. We do, however, pursuant to contractual obligations provide
indemnity and defense with respect to certain of the claims in this litigation. The defendants in this litigation believe that
the claims alleged by the plaintiffs are meritless and are defending this matter vigorously. 

Amy Mathews v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Arkansas
LLC, Case No. CV-2015-0294 , in the Circuit Court of Independence County, Arkansas, Civil Division. This purported class action
alleges a violation of the Arkansas Deceptive Trade Practices Act based on the same allegations of the state attorney general that
serve as the basis for the claims in the Herbal Supplements multidistrict litigation referenced above, and seeks certification
of a class of Arkansas residents purportedly impacted by the allegations. We are not a party to this litigation but provide indemnity
and defense with respect to certain of the claims in this litigation. 

Rite Aid Hdqrts. Corp v. Twinlab Corporation, Case No. 2016-05532 ,
in the Cumberland Court of Common Please, Pennsylvania. The plaintiff in this matter alleges that we are in breach of contract
related to the return of damaged, defective, outdated or discontinued goods, and further alleges that we are in breach of contract
related to certain temporary price reductions or mark-downs of Twinlab products in Rite Aid Stores. We believe the plaintiff s
claims are without merit and are defending this case vigorously. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.  

Risks and uncertainties that, if they were to occur, could materially
adversely affect our business or cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking
statements contained in this report and other public statements were set forth in the  Item 1A Risk Factors  section
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. 

Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or
that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial conditions and/or operating
results.
