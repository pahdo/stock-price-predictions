Note 1.  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  Bank of Hawaii Corporation (the  Parent ) is a Delaware corporation and a bank holding company headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii.  Bank of Hawaii Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company ) provide a broad range of financial products and services to customers in Hawaii, Guam, and other Pacific Islands.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Parent and its subsidiaries.  The Parent s principal operating subsidiary is Bank of Hawaii (the  Bank ).   
    
  The consolidated financial statements in this report have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, but in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods.  All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.   All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  Certain prior period information has been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  Operating results for the interim periods disclosed herein are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full fiscal year or for any future period. 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and accompanying notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .   
    
  Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences could be material to the financial statements. 
    
  Variable Interest Entities 
    
  Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity's net asset value.  The primary beneficiary consolidates the variable interest entity ("VIE").  The primary beneficiary is defined as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the VIE. 
    
  The Company has limited partnership interests in several low-income housing partnerships.  These partnerships provide funds for the construction and operation of apartment complexes that provide affordable housing to low-income households.  If these developments successfully attract a specified percentage of residents falling in that lower income range, state and/or federal income tax credits are made available to the partners.  The tax credits are generally recognized over   10   years.  In order to continue receiving the tax credits each year over the life of the partnership, the low-income residency targets must be maintained.  
    
  Prior to January 1, 2015, the Company utilized the effective yield method whereby the Company recognized tax credits generally over   10   years and amortized the initial cost of the investment to provide a constant effective yield over the period that tax credits are allocated to the Company.  On January 1, 2015, the Company adopted ASU No. 2014-01,   "Accounting for Investments in Qualified Affordable Housing Projects"   prospectively for new investments.      ASU No. 2014-01 permits reporting entities to make an accounting policy election to account for their investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain conditions are met.  As permitted by ASU No. 2014-01, the Company elected to continue to utilize the effective yield method for investments made prior to January 1, 2015.   
    
  Unfunded commitments to fund these low-income housing partnerships were   $22.4 million   and   $25.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  These unfunded commitments are unconditional and legally binding  
  
   7 

     Table of Contents  

and are recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of condition.  See Note 5   Affordable Housing Projects Tax Credit Partnerships   for more information. 
    
  The Company also has limited partnership interests in solar energy tax credit partnership investments.  These partnerships develop, build, own and operate solar renewable energy projects.  Over the course of these investments, the Company expects to receive federal and state tax credits, tax-related benefits, and excess cash available for distribution, if any.  The Company may be called to sell its interest in the limited partnerships through a call option once all investment tax credits have been recognized.  Tax benefits associated with these investments are generally recognized over   6   years. 
  These entities meet the definition of a VIE; however, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the entities, as the general partner has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entities.  While the partnership agreements allow the limited partners, through a majority vote, to remove the general partner, this right is not deemed to be substantive as the general partner can only be removed for cause. 
    
  The investments in these entities are initially recorded at cost, which approximates the maximum exposure to loss as a result of the Company's involvement with these unconsolidated entities.  The balance of the Company's investments in these entities was   $78.0 million   and   $79.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, and is included in other assets in the consolidated statements of condition. 
    
  Accounting Standards Adopted in 2016 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,    Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.     This ASU affects reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities.  Specifically, the amendments: (1) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ( VIEs ) or voting interest entities; (2) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership; (3) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and (4) provide a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.  The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-02 effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption of ASU No. 2015-02 did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,    Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.     This ASU provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.  The new guidance does not change the accounting for a customer s accounting for service contracts.  The purpose of ASU 2015-05 is to clarify which fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement should be capitalized and which fees should be expensed as incurred.  The Company prospectively adopted ASU No. 2015-05 effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption of ASU No. 2015-05 did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Accounting Standards Pending Adoption 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (the "IASB") jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRS").  Previous revenue recognition guidance in GAAP consisted of broad revenue recognition concepts together with numerous revenue requirements for particular industries or transactions, which sometimes resulted in different accounting for economically similar transactions.  In contrast, IFRS provided limited revenue recognition guidance and, consequently, could be difficult to apply to complex transactions.  Accordingly, the FASB and the IASB initiated a joint project to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard for U.S. GAAP and IFRS that would: (1) remove inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements; (2) provide a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues; (3) improve comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets; (4) provide more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements; and (5) simplify the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer.  To meet those objectives, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   "Revenue from Contracts with Customers."    The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

exchange for those goods or services.  In doing so, companies generally will be required to use more judgment and make more estimates than under current guidance.  These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation.  The standard was initially effective for public entities for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016; early adoption was not permitted.  However, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   "Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date"   which deferred the effective date by one year (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017).  For financial reporting purposes, the standard allows for either full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all of the periods presented, or modified retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied only to the most current period presented in the financial statements with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard recognized at the date of initial application.  In addition, the FASB has begun to issue targeted updates to clarify specific implementation issues of ASU 2014-09.  These updates include ASU No. 2016-08,    Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net),    ASU No. 2016-10,    Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,    and ASU No. 2016-12    Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.     The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2014-09 and its related updates and will be closely monitoring developments and additional guidance to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."    This ASU addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments by making targeted improvements to GAAP as follows: (1) require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer; (2) simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment.  When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value; (3) eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities; (4) eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (5) require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (6) require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (7) require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (8) clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.  ASU No. 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early application is permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption only for provisions (3) and (6) above.  Early adoption of the other provisions mentioned above is not permitted.  The Company has performed a preliminary evaluation of the provisions of ASU No. 2016-01.  Based on this evaluation, the Company has determined that ASU No. 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements; however, the Company will continue to closely monitor developments and additional guidance. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   "Leases."    Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases):  1) a lease liability, which is the present value of a lessee's obligation to make lease payments, and 2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee's right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.  Lessor accounting under the new guidance remains largely unchanged as it is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases, and operating leases.  Leveraged leases have been eliminated, although lessors can continue to account for existing leveraged leases using the current accounting guidance.  Other limited changes were made to align lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and the new revenue recognition standard  .    All entities will classify leases to determine how to recognize lease-related revenue and expense.  Quantitative and qualitative disclosures will be required by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases.  The intention is to require enough information to supplement the amounts recorded in the financial statements so that users can understand more about the nature of an entity s leasing activities.  ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018; early adoption is permitted.  All entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements.  They have the option to use certain relief; full retrospective application is prohibited.  The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of

     Table of Contents  

ASU No. 2016-02 and will be closely monitoring developments and additional guidance to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.     This ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements.  Some of the key provisions of this new ASU include: (1) companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in capital ( APIC ).  Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, and APIC pools will be eliminated.  The guidance also eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them.  In addition, the guidance requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity; (2) increase the amount an employer can withhold to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation.  The new guidance will also require an employer to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on its statement of cash flows (current guidance did not specify how these cash flows should be classified); and (3) permit companies to make an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards.  Forfeitures can be estimated, as required today, or recognized when they occur.  ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period.  The Company expects adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 could result in increased volatility to reported income tax expense related to excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies for employee share-based transactions, however, the actual amounts recognized in income tax expense will be dependent on the amount of employee share-based transactions and the stock price at the time of vesting. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,    Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.     This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income.  In issuing the standard, the FASB is responding to criticism that today s guidance delays recognition of credit losses.  The standard will replace today s  incurred loss  approach with an  expected loss  model.  The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures.  This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees.  The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale ( AFS ) debt securities.  For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.  As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today.  The ASU also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.  ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses.  In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination.  ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach).  The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,    Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."    Current GAAP is unclear or does not include specific guidance on how to classify certain transactions in the statement of cash flows.  This ASU is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how eight particular transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period.  Entities will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively.  If it is impracticable to apply the guidance retrospectively for an issue, the amendments related to that issue would be applied prospectively.  As this guidance only affects the classification within the statement of cash flows, ASU No. 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Note 2.  Investment Securities 
    
  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of the Company s investment securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

     Table of Contents  

The table below presents an analysis of the contractual maturities of the Company s investment securities as of   September 30, 2016  .  Debt securities issued by government agencies (Small Business Administration securities) and mortgage-backed securities are disclosed separately in the table below as these investment securities may prepay prior to their scheduled contractual maturity dates. 

Investment securities with carrying values of   $2.4 billion   and   $2.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged to secure deposits of governmental entities and securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 
    
  The table below presents the gains and losses from the sales of investment securities for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

The losses during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were due to fees paid to the counterparties of our prior Visa Class B share sale transactions.

The Company s investment securities in an unrealized loss position, segregated by continuous length of impairment, were as follows:

     Table of Contents  

The Company does not believe that the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016  , which were comprised of   120   securities, represent an other-than-temporary impairment.  Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates, relative to when the investment securities were purchased, and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the gross unrealized losses were primarily related to investment securities issued by Ginnie Mae and corporate debt securities.  The Company does not intend to sell the investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investment securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. 
    
  Interest income from taxable and non-taxable investment securities for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , included in the Company's investment securities portfolio were debt securities issued by political subdivisions within the State of Hawaii of   $543.8 million  , representing   57%   of the total fair value of the Company's municipal debt securities.  Of the entire Hawaii municipal bond portfolio,   94%   were credit-rated Aa2 or better by Moody's while the remaining Hawaii municipal bonds were credit-rated A2 or better by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  Of the Company's total Hawaii municipal bond holdings,   77%   were general obligation issuances.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no other holdings of municipal debt securities that were issued by a single state or political subdivision which comprised more than   10%   of the total fair value of the Company's municipal debt securities. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the Company s Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines stock and Federal Reserve Bank stock was as follows: 

These securities can only be redeemed or sold at their par value and only to the respective issuing government-supported institution or to another member institution.  The Company records these non-marketable equity securities as a component of other assets and periodically evaluates these securities for impairment.  Management considers these non-marketable equity securities to be long-term investments.  Accordingly, when evaluating these securities for impairment, management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. 
    
  Visa Class B Restricted Shares 
    
  In 2008, the Company received Visa Class B restricted shares as part of Visa s initial public offering.  These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A common shares.  This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which is indemnified by Visa members, including the Company.  Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims.  Should this escrow account not be sufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank's Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the conversion ratio was   1.6483  .  
    
  During the first quarter of   2016  , the Company recorded an   $11.2 million   net gain on the sale of   100,000   Visa Class B shares.  Concurrent with every sale of Visa Class B shares, the Company has entered into an agreement with the buyer that requires payment to the buyer in the event Visa further reduces the conversion ratio.  Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the outcome of the Visa litigation mentioned above, the remaining   184,814   Class B shares (  304,629   Class A equivalents) that the Company owns are carried at a zero cost basis.

Credit Quality Indicators 
    
  The Company uses several credit quality indicators to manage credit risk in an ongoing manner.  The Company uses an internal credit risk rating system that categorizes loans and leases into pass, special mention, or classified categories.  Credit risk ratings are applied individually to those classes of loans and leases that have significant or unique credit characteristics that benefit from a case-by-case evaluation.  These are typically loans and leases to businesses or individuals in the classes which comprise the commercial portfolio segment.  Groups of loans and leases that are underwritten and structured using standardized criteria and characteristics, such as statistical models (e.g., credit scoring or payment performance), are typically risk-rated and monitored collectively.  These are typically loans and leases to individuals in the classes which comprise the consumer portfolio segment. 
    
  The following are the definitions of the Company s credit quality indicators: 
    
           Pass: 
    Loans and leases in all classes within the commercial and consumer portfolio segments that are not adversely rated, are contractually current as to principal and interest, and are otherwise in compliance with the contractual terms of the loan or lease agreement.  Management believes that there is a low likelihood of loss related to those loans and leases that are considered pass. 
       
           Special Mention: 
    Loans and leases in the classes within the commercial portfolio segment that have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention.  If not addressed, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or lease.  The special mention credit quality indicator is not used for classes of loans and leases that are included in the consumer portfolio segment.  Management believes that there is a moderate likelihood of some loss related to those loans and leases that are considered special mention. 
       
           Classified: 
    Loans and leases in the classes within the commercial portfolio segment that are inadequately protected by the sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged, if any.   Classified loans and leases are also those in the classes within the consumer portfolio segment that are past due   90   days or more as to principal or interest.  Residential mortgage loans that are past due   90   days or more as to principal or interest may be considered pass if the Company is in the process of collection and the current loan-to-value ratio is   60%   or less.  Home equity loans that are past due   90   days or more as to principal or interest may be considered pass if the Company is in the process of collection, the first mortgage is with the Company, and the current combined loan-to-value ratio is   60%   or less.  Residential mortgage and home equity loans may be current as to principal and interest, but may be considered classified for a period of generally up to   six   months following a loan modification.  Following a period of demonstrated performance in accordance with the modified contractual terms, the loan may be removed from classified status.  Management believes that there is a distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies related to classified loans and leases are not corrected in a timely manner.

     Table of Contents  

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the amounts of interest income recognized by the Company within the periods that the loans were impaired were primarily related to loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring that remained on accrual status.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the amount of interest income recognized using a cash-basis method of accounting during the periods that the loans were impaired was not material. 
    
  Modifications 
    
  A modification of a loan constitutes a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) when the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider.  Loans modified in a TDR were   $59.4 million   and   $65.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   $0.7 million   commitments to lend additional funds on loans modified in a TDR.  As of   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   commitments to lend additional funds on loans modified in a TDR. 
    
  The Company offers various types of concessions when modifying a loan or lease.  Commercial and industrial loans modified in a TDR often involve temporary interest-only payments, term extensions, and converting revolving credit lines to term loans.  Additional collateral, a co-borrower, or a guarantor is often requested.  Commercial mortgage and construction loans modified in a TDR often involve reducing the interest rate for the remaining term of the loan, extending the maturity date at an interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, or substituting or adding a co-borrower or guarantor.  Construction loans modified in a TDR may also involve extending the interest-only payment period.  Residential mortgage loans modified in a TDR generally include a lower interest rate and the loan being fully amortized for up to   40 years   from the modification effective date.  In some cases, the Company may forbear a portion of the unpaid principal balance with a balloon payment due upon maturity or pay-off of the loan.  Land loans are also included in the class of residential mortgage loans.   Land loans are typically structured as interest-only monthly payments with a balloon payment due at maturity.  Land loan modifications usually involve extending the interest-only monthly payments up to an additional   five   years with a balloon payment due at maturity, or re-amortizing the remaining balance over a period up to   360 months  .  Interest rates are not changed for land loan modifications.  Home equity modifications are made infrequently and uniquely designed to meet the specific needs of each borrower.  Automobile loans modified in a TDR are primarily comprised of loans where the Company has lowered monthly payments by extending the term. 
    
  Loans modified in a TDR are typically already on non-accrual status and partial charge-offs have in some cases already been taken against the outstanding loan balance.  As a result, loans modified in a TDR may have the financial effect of increasing the specific Allowance associated with the loan.  An Allowance for impaired consumer and commercial loans that have been modified in a TDR is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s observable market price, or the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs, if the loan is collateral dependent.  Management exercises significant judgment in developing these estimates.

    Comprised of other revolving credit and installment financing. 
     Commercial and consumer loans modified in a TDR are closely monitored for delinquency as an early indicator of possible future default.  If loans modified in a TDR subsequently default, the Company evaluates the loan for possible further impairment.  The specific Allowance associated with the loan may be increased, adjustments may be made in the allocation of the Allowance, or partial charge-offs may be taken to further write-down the carrying value of the loan. 
    
  Foreclosure Proceedings 
    
  Consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that are in the process of foreclosure totaled   $7.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Note 4.  Mortgage Servicing Rights 
    
  The Company s portfolio of residential mortgage loans serviced for third parties was   $2.7 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Substantially all of these loans were originated by the Company and sold to third parties on a non-recourse basis with servicing rights retained.  These retained servicing rights are recorded as a servicing asset and are initially recorded at fair value (see Note 13   Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities   for more information).  Changes to the balance of mortgage servicing rights are recorded in mortgage banking income in the Company s consolidated statements of income.   
    
  The Company s mortgage servicing activities include collecting principal, interest, and escrow payments from borrowers; making tax and insurance payments on behalf of borrowers; monitoring delinquencies and executing foreclosure proceedings; and accounting for and remitting principal and interest payments to investors.  Servicing income, including late and ancillary fees, was   $1.7 million   and   $1.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $5.2 million   and   $5.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Servicing income is recorded in

     Table of Contents  

mortgage banking income in the Company s consolidated statements of income.  The Company s residential mortgage investor loan servicing portfolio is primarily comprised of fixed rate loans concentrated in Hawaii. 
    
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the change in the carrying value of the Company s mortgage servicing rights accounted for under the fair value measurement method was as follows: 

1   
    Primarily represents changes in discount rates and loan repayment rate assumptions, mostly due to changes in interest rates. 
       
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the change in the carrying value of the Company s mortgage servicing rights accounted for under the amortization method, net of valuation allowance, was as follows: 

The key data and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the Company s mortgage servicing rights as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

1   
    Represents annualized loan repayment rate assumption. 
               2   
    Derived from multiple interest rate scenarios that incorporate a spread to a market yield curve and market volatilities.

A sensitivity analysis of the Company s fair value of mortgage servicing rights to changes in certain key assumptions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is presented in the following table. 

This analysis generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of a change in one key assumption to the change in the fair value of the Company s mortgage servicing rights usually is not linear.  Also, the effect of changing one key assumption without changing other assumptions is not realistic. 

Note 5.  Affordable Housing Projects Tax Credit Partnerships 
    
  The Company makes equity investments in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects utilizing the Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) pursuant to Section 42 of the Internal Revenue Code.  The purpose of these investments is to achieve a satisfactory return on capital, to facilitate the sale of affordable housing product offerings, and to assist in achieving goals associated with the Community Reinvestment Act.  The primary activities of the limited partnerships include the identification, development, and operation of multi-family housing that is leased to qualifying residential tenants.  Generally, these types of investments are funded through a combination of debt and equity. 
    
  The Company is a limited partner in each LIHTC limited partnership.  Each limited partnership is managed by an unrelated third party general partner who exercises full control over the affairs of the limited partnership.  The general partner has all the rights, powers and authority granted or permitted to be granted to a general partner of a limited partnership.  Duties entrusted to the general partner of each limited partnership include, but are not limited to: investment in operating companies, company expenditures, investment of excess funds, borrowing funds, employment of agents, disposition of fund property, prepayment and refinancing of liabilities, votes and consents, contract authority, disbursement of funds, accounting methods, tax elections, bank accounts, insurance, litigation, cash reserve, and use of working capital reserve funds.  Except for limited rights granted to the limited partner(s) relating to the approval of certain transactions, the limited partner(s) may not participate in the operation, management, or control of the limited partnership s business, transact any business in the limited partnership s name or have any power to sign documents for or otherwise bind the limited partnership.  In addition, the general partner may only be removed by the limited partner(s) in the event the general partner fails to comply with the terms of the agreement or is negligent in performing its duties. 
    
  The general partner of each limited partnership has both the power to direct the activities which most significantly affect the performance of each partnership and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entities.  Therefore, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of any LIHTC partnership.  The Company uses the effective yield method to account for its pre-2015 investments in these entities.  Beginning January 1, 2015, any new investments that meet the requirements of the proportional amortization method are recognized using the proportional amortization method.  The Company's net affordable housing tax credit investments and related unfunded commitments were   $67.5 million   and   $68.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in other assets in the consolidated statements of condition.

Note 6.  Balance Sheet Offsetting 
    
  Interest Rate Swap Agreements ( Swap Agreements ) 
  The Company enters into swap agreements to facilitate the risk management strategies of a small number of commercial banking customers.  The Company mitigates the risk of entering into these agreements by entering into equal and offsetting swap agreements with highly-rated third party financial institutions.  The swap agreements are free-standing derivatives and are recorded at fair value in the Company's consolidated statements of condition (asset positions are included in other assets and liability positions are included in other liabilities).  The Company is party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparties; however, the Company does not offset assets and liabilities under these arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes.  The master netting arrangements provide for a single net settlement of all swap agreements, as well as collateral, in the event of default on, or termination of, any one contract.  Collateral, usually in the form of marketable securities, is posted by the party (i.e., the Company or the financial institution counterparty) with net liability positions in accordance with contract thresholds.  The Company had net liability positions with its financial institution counterparties totaling   $17.8 million   and   $13.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  See Note 11   Derivative Financial Instruments   for more information. 
  Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase ( Repurchase Agreements ) 
  The Company enters into agreements under which it sells securities subject to an obligation to repurchase the same or similar securities.  Under these arrangements, the Company may transfer legal control over the assets but still retain effective control through an agreement that both entitles and obligates the Company to repurchase the assets.  As a result, these repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing arrangements (i.e., secured borrowings) and not as sales and subsequent repurchases of securities.  The obligation to repurchase the securities is reflected as a liability in the Company's consolidated statements of condition, while the securities underlying the repurchase agreements remain in the respective investment securities asset accounts.  As a result, there is no offsetting or netting of the investment securities assets with the repurchase agreement liabilities.  In addition, as the Company does not enter into reverse repurchase agreements, there is no such offsetting to be done with the repurchase agreements. 

27 

     Table of Contents  

The right of setoff for a repurchase agreement resembles a secured borrowing, whereby the collateral pledged by the Company would be used to settle the fair value of the repurchase agreement should the Company be in default (e.g., fail to make an interest payment to the counterparty).  For private institution repurchase agreements, if the private institution counterparty were to default (e.g., declare bankruptcy), the Company could cancel the repurchase agreement (i.e., cease payment of principal and interest) and attempt collection on the amount of collateral value in excess of the repurchase agreement fair value.  The collateral is held by a third party financial institution in the counterparty's custodial account.  The counterparty has the right to sell or repledge the investment securities.  For government entity repurchase agreements, the collateral is held by the Company in a segregated custodial account under a tri-party agreement.  The Company is required by the counterparty to maintain adequate collateral levels.  In the event the collateral fair value falls below stipulated levels, the Company will pledge additional securities.  The Company closely monitors collateral levels to ensure adequate levels are maintained, while mitigating the potential risk of over-collateralization in the event of counterparty default. 
    
  The following table presents the remaining contractual maturities of the Company s repurchase agreements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, disaggregated by the class of collateral pledged.

The following table presents the assets and liabilities subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, or repurchase agreements, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The swap agreements we have with our commercial banking customers are not subject to an enforceable master netting arrangement, and therefore, are excluded from this table. 

1     The application of collateral cannot reduce the net amount below zero.  Therefore, excess collateral is not reflected in this table.  For repurchase agreements with private institutions, the fair value of investment securities pledged was   $609.9 million   and   $663.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  For repurchase agreements with government entities, the fair value of investment securities pledged was   $33.1 million   and   $66.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

The following is a reconciliation of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for computing diluted earnings per share and antidilutive stock options and restricted stock outstanding for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Note 9.  Business Segments 
    
  The Company s business segments are defined as Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, Investment Services, and Treasury and Other.  The Company s internal management accounting process measures the performance of these business segments.  This process, which is not necessarily comparable with the process used by any other financial institution, uses various techniques to assign balance sheet and income statement amounts to the business segments, including allocations of income, expense, the provision for credit losses, and capital.  This process is dynamic and requires certain allocations based on judgment and other subjective factors.  Unlike financial accounting, there is no comprehensive authoritative guidance for management accounting that is equivalent to GAAP.  Previously reported results have been reclassified to conform to the current reporting structure. 
    
  The net interest income of the business segments reflects the results of a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics and reflects the allocation of net interest income related to the Company s overall asset and liability management activities on a proportionate basis.  The basis for the allocation of net interest income is a function of the Company s assumptions that are subject to change based on changes in current interest rates and market conditions.  Funds transfer pricing also serves to transfer interest rate risk to Treasury.  However, the other business segments have some latitude to retain certain interest rate exposures related to customer pricing decisions within guidelines. 
    
  The provision for credit losses reflects the actual net charge-offs of the business segments.  The amount of the consolidated provision for loan and lease losses is based on the methodology that we use to estimate our consolidated Allowance.  The residual provision for credit losses to arrive at the consolidated provision for credit losses is included in Treasury and Other. 
    
  Noninterest income and expense includes allocations from support units to business units.  These allocations are based on actual usage where practicably calculated or by management s estimate of such usage. 
    
  The provision for income taxes is allocated to business segments using a   37%   effective income tax rate.  However, the provision for income taxes for our Leasing business unit (included in the Commercial Banking segment) and Auto Leasing portfolio and Pacific Century Life Insurance business unit (both included in the Retail Banking segment) are assigned their actual effective income tax rates due to the unique relationship that income taxes have with their products.  The residual income tax expense or benefit to arrive at the consolidated effective income tax rate is included in Treasury and Other. 
    
  Retail Banking 
    
  Retail Banking offers a broad range of financial products and services to consumers and small businesses.

Commercial Banking 
    
  Commercial Banking offers products including corporate banking, commercial real estate loans, commercial lease financing, auto dealer financing, and deposit products.  Commercial lending and deposit products are offered to middle-market and large companies in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  Commercial real estate mortgages focus on customers that include investors, developers, and builders predominantly domiciled in Hawaii.  Commercial Banking also includes international banking and provides merchant services to its small business customers. 
    
  Investment Services 
    
  Investment Services includes private banking and international client banking, trust services, investment management, and institutional investment advisory services.  A significant portion of this segment s income is derived from fees, which are generally based on the market values of assets under management.  The private banking and personal trust group assists individuals and families in building and preserving their wealth by providing investment, credit, and trust services to high-net-worth individuals.  The investment management group manages portfolios utilizing a variety of investment products.  Institutional client services offer investment advice to corporations, government entities, and foundations.  This segment also provides a full service brokerage offering equities, mutual funds, life insurance, and annuity products. 
    
  Treasury and Other 
    
  Treasury consists of corporate asset and liability management activities, including interest rate risk management and a foreign currency exchange business.  This segment s assets and liabilities (and related interest income and expense) consist of interest-bearing deposits, investment securities, federal funds sold and purchased, government deposits, and short and long-term borrowings.  The primary sources of noninterest income are from bank-owned life insurance, net gains from the sale of investment securities, and foreign exchange income related to customer-driven currency requests from merchants and island visitors.  The net residual effect of the transfer pricing of assets and liabilities is included in Treasury, along with the elimination of intercompany transactions. 
    
  Other organizational units (Technology, Operations, Marketing, Human Resources, Finance, Credit and Risk Management, and Corporate and Regulatory Administration) provide a wide-range of support to the Company s other income earning segments.  Expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the business segments through an internal cost allocation process.

The following table presents the Company s derivative financial instruments and the amount and location of the net gains or losses recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Management has received authorization from the Bank s Board of Directors to use derivative financial instruments as an end-user in connection with the Bank's risk management activities and to accommodate the needs of the Bank's customers.  As with any financial instrument, derivative financial instruments have inherent risks.  Market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity prices.  Market risks associated with derivative financial instruments are balanced with the expected returns to enhance earnings performance and shareholder value, while limiting the volatility of each.  The Company uses various processes to monitor its overall market risk exposure, including sensitivity analysis, value-at-risk calculations, and other methodologies. 
    
  Derivative financial instruments are also subject to credit and counterparty risk, which is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle transactions in accordance with the underlying contractual terms.  Credit and counterparty risks associated with derivative financial instruments are similar to those relating to traditional financial instruments.  The Company manages derivative credit and counterparty risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of each borrower or counterparty, adhering to the same credit approval process used for commercial lending activities. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not designate any derivative financial instruments as formal hedging relationships.  The Company s free-standing derivative financial instruments are required to be carried at their fair value on the Company s consolidated statements of condition.  These financial instruments have been limited to interest rate lock commitments ( IRLCs ), forward commitments, interest rate swap agreements, foreign exchange contracts, and conversion rate swap agreements. 
    
  The Company enters into IRLCs for residential mortgage loans which commit us to lend funds to a potential borrower at a specific interest rate and within a specified period of time.  IRLCs that relate to the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale are considered derivative financial instruments under applicable accounting guidance.  Outstanding IRLCs expose the Company to the risk that the price of the mortgage loans underlying the commitments may decline due to increases in mortgage interest rates from inception of the rate lock to the funding of the loan.  To mitigate this risk, the Company utilizes forward commitments as economic hedges against the potential decreases in the values of the loans held for sale.  IRLCs and forward commitments are free-standing derivatives which are carried at fair value with changes recorded in the mortgage banking component of noninterest income in the Company s consolidated statements of income. 
    
  The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements to facilitate the risk management strategies of a small number of commercial banking customers.  The Company mitigates the interest rate risk of entering into these agreements by entering into equal and offsetting interest rate swap agreements with highly rated third party financial institutions.  The interest rate swap agreements are free-standing derivatives and are recorded at fair value in the Company's consolidated statements of condition.  Fair value changes are recorded in other noninterest income in the Company s consolidated statements of income.  The Company is party to master netting arrangements with its financial institution counterparties; however, the Company does not offset assets and liabilities under these arrangements for financial statement presentation purposes.  Collateral, usually in the form of marketable securities, is posted by the counterparty with net liability positions in accordance with contract thresholds.  See Note 6   Balance Sheet Offsetting   for more information. 
    
  The Company s interest rate swap agreements with financial institution counterparties may contain credit-risk-related contingent features tied to a specified credit rating of the Company.  Under these provisions, should the Company s specified rating fall below a particular level (e.g., investment grade rating), or if the Company no longer obtains the specified rating, the counterparty may require the Company to pledge collateral on an immediate and ongoing basis (subject to the requirement that such swaps are in a net liability position beyond the level specified in the contract), or require immediate settlement of the swap  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

agreement.  Other credit-risk-related contingent features may also allow the counterparty to require immediate settlement of the swap agreement if the Company fails to maintain a specified minimum level of capitalization.  
    
  The Company utilizes foreign exchange contracts to offset risks related to transactions executed on behalf of customers.  The foreign exchange contracts are free-standing derivatives which are carried at fair value with changes included in other noninterest income in the Company s consolidated statements of income. 
    
  As each sale of Visa Class B restricted shares was completed, the Company entered into a conversion rate swap agreement with the buyer that requires payment to the buyer in the event Visa further reduces the conversion ratio of Class B into Class A unrestricted common shares.  In the event of Visa increasing the conversion ratio, the buyer would be required to make payment to the Company.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the conversion rate swap agreement was valued at   zero   (i.e., no contingent liability recorded) as further reductions to the conversion ratio were deemed neither probable nor reasonably estimable by management.  See Note 2   Investment Securities   for more information. 

Note 12.  Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees 
  The Company s credit commitments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

Unfunded Commitments to Extend Credit 
    
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of the terms or conditions established in the contract.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee.  Since commitments may expire without being drawn, the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future cash requirements. 
    
  Standby and Commercial Letters of Credit 
    
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  Standby letters of credit generally become payable upon the failure of the customer to perform according to the terms of the underlying contract with the third party, while commercial letters of credit are issued specifically to facilitate commerce and typically result in the commitment being drawn on when the underlying transaction is consummated between the customer and a third party.  The contractual amount of these letters of credit represents the maximum potential future payments guaranteed by the Company.  The Company has recourse against the customer for any amount it is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit, and generally holds cash or deposits as collateral on those standby letters of credit for which collateral is deemed necessary. 
    
  Contingencies  
    
  The Company is subject to various pending and threatened legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business or operations.  On at least a quarterly basis, the Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the most recent information available.  On a case-by-case basis, reserves are established for those legal claims for which it is probable that a loss will be incurred and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated.  Based on information currently available, management believes that the eventual outcome of these claims against the Company will not be materially in excess of such amounts reserved by the Company.  However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may result in a loss that materially exceeds the reserves established by the Company. 
    
  Risks Related to Representation and Warranty Provisions 
    
  The Company sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae").  The Company also pools Federal Housing Administration ( FHA ) insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ( VA ) guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to the Government National Mortgage Corporation ("Ginnie  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

Mae").  These pools of FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans are securitized by Ginnie Mae.  The agreements under which the Company sells residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with FHA and VA contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans.  Although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors, insurance or guarantee agreements, they typically cover ownership of the loan, validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, and other matters.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans sold by the Company was   $2.5 billion  .  The agreements under which the Company sells residential mortgage loans require delivery of various documents to the investor or its document custodian.  Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, the Company may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors for losses incurred if a loan review reveals that underwriting and documentation standards were potentially not met.  Some agreements may require the Company to repurchase delinquent loans.  Upon receipt of a repurchase request, the Company works with investors or insurers to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution.  Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan-by-loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor or insurer and to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred.  The Company manages the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through its underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were   no   residential mortgage loans repurchased as a result of the representation and warranty provisions contained in these contracts.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   pending repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions. 
    
  Risks Relating to Residential Mortgage Loan Servicing Activities 
    
  In addition to servicing loans in the Company's portfolio, substantially all of the loans the Company sells to investors are sold with servicing rights retained.  The Company also services loans originated by other mortgage loan originators.  As servicer, the Company's primary duties are to: (1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments; and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the documents governing a securitization, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales.  Each agreement under which the Company acts as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by the Company in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by the Company when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements.  However, if the Company commits a material breach of obligations as servicer, the Company may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice.  The standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investor.  These standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the Company.  Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were   no   loans repurchased related to loan servicing activities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   pending repurchase requests related to loan servicing activities.  
    
  Although to date repurchase requests related to representation and warranty provisions and servicing activities have been limited, it is possible that requests to repurchase mortgage loans may increase in frequency as investors more aggressively pursue all means of recovering losses on their purchased loans.  However, as of   September 30, 2016  , management believes that this exposure is not material due to the historical level of repurchase requests and loss trends and thus has not established a liability for losses related to mortgage loan repurchases.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   99%   of the Company's residential mortgage loans serviced for investors were current.  The Company maintains ongoing communications with investors and continues to evaluate this exposure by monitoring the level and number of repurchase requests as well as the delinquency rates in the loans sold to investors.

Note 13.  Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
    
  Fair Value Hierarchy 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  GAAP established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation methodologies into the following three levels: 
                 Level 1: 
    Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices, unadjusted, for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is used to measure fair value whenever available.  A contractually binding sales price also provides reliable evidence of fair value. 

Level 2: 
    Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or inputs to the valuation methodology that utilize model-based techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 

Level 3: 
    Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement; inputs to the valuation methodology that utilize model-based techniques for which significant assumptions are not observable in the market; or inputs to the valuation methodology that require significant management judgment or estimation, some of which may be internally developed. 

Management maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value measurements.  Management reviews and updates the fair value hierarchy classifications of the Company s assets and liabilities on a quarterly basis. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
    
  Investment Securities Available-for-Sale 
    
  Fair values of investment securities available-for-sale were primarily measured using information from a third-party pricing service.  This service provides pricing information by utilizing evaluated pricing models supported with market data information.  Standard inputs include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data from market research publications.  Level 1 investment securities are comprised of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, as quoted prices were available, unadjusted, for identical securities in active markets.  Level 2 investment securities were primarily comprised of debt securities issued by the Small Business Administration, states and municipalities, corporations, as well as mortgage-backed securities issued by government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises.  Fair values were estimated primarily by obtaining quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or through the use of pricing models.  In cases where there may be limited or less transparent information provided by the Company s third-party pricing service, fair value may be estimated by the use of secondary pricing services or through the use of non-binding third-party broker quotes. 
    
  On a quarterly basis, management reviews the pricing information received from the Company s third-party pricing service.  This review process includes a comparison to non-binding third-party broker quotes, as well as a review of market-related conditions impacting the information provided by the Company s third-party pricing service.  Management primarily identifies investment securities which may have traded in illiquid or inactive markets by identifying instances of a significant decrease in the volume or frequency of trades, relative to historical levels, as well as instances of a significant widening of the bid-ask spread in the brokered markets.  Investment securities that are deemed to have been trading in illiquid or inactive markets may require the use of significant unobservable inputs to determine fair value.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , management did not make adjustments to prices provided by the third-party pricing service as a result of illiquid or inactive markets.  On a quarterly basis, management also reviews a sample of securities priced by the Company s third-party pricing service to review the significant assumptions and valuation methodologies used by the service.  Based on this review, management determines whether the current placement of the security in the fair value hierarchy is appropriate or whether transfers may be warranted.  The Company s third-party pricing service has also established processes for us to submit inquiries regarding quoted prices.  Periodically, we will challenge the quoted prices provided by our third-party pricing service.  The Company s third-party pricing service will review the inputs to the evaluation in light of the new market data presented by us.   
  
   40 

     Table of Contents  

The Company s third-party pricing service may then affirm the original quoted price or may update the evaluation on a going-forward basis. 
    
  Loans Held for Sale 
    
  The fair value of the Company s residential mortgage loans held for sale was determined based on quoted prices for similar loans in active markets, and therefore, is classified as a Level 2 measurement. 
    
  Mortgage Servicing Rights 
    
  Mortgage servicing rights do not trade in an active market with readily observable market data.  As a result, the Company estimates the fair value of mortgage servicing rights by using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income.  The Company stratifies its mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of loan type.  The assumptions used in the discounted cash flow model are those that we believe market participants would use in estimating future net servicing income.  Significant assumptions in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights include estimated loan repayment rates, the discount rate, servicing costs, and the timing of cash flows, among other factors.  Mortgage servicing rights are classified as Level 3 measurements due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, as well as significant management judgment and estimation. 
    
  Other Assets 
    
  Other assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are primarily comprised of investments related to deferred compensation arrangements.  Quoted prices for these investments, primarily in mutual funds, are available in active markets.  Thus, the Company s investments related to deferred compensation arrangements are classified as Level 1 measurements in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  Derivative financial instruments recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are comprised of interest rate lock commitments ( IRLCs ), forward commitments, interest rate swap agreements, foreign exchange contracts, and Visa Class B to Class A shares conversion rate swap agreements.  The fair values of IRLCs are calculated based on the value of the underlying loan held for sale, which in turn is based on quoted prices for similar loans in the secondary market.  However, this value is adjusted by a factor which considers the likelihood that the loan in a locked position will ultimately close.  This factor, the closing ratio, is derived from the Bank s internal data and is adjusted using significant management judgment.  As such, IRLCs are classified as Level 3 measurements.  Forward commitments are classified as Level 2 measurements as they are primarily based on quoted prices from the secondary market based on the settlement date of the contracts, interpolated or extrapolated, if necessary, to estimate a fair value as of the end of the reporting period.  The fair values of interest rate swap agreements are calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and utilize Level 2 observable inputs such as a market yield curve, effective date, maturity date, notional amount, and stated interest rate.  In addition, the Company includes in its fair value calculation a credit factor adjustment which is based primarily on management judgment.  Thus, interest rate swap agreements are classified as a Level 3 measurement.  The fair values of foreign exchange contracts are calculated using the Bank s multi-currency accounting system which utilizes contract specific information such as currency, maturity date, contractual amount, and strike price, along with market data information such as the spot rates of specific currency and yield curves.  Foreign exchange contracts are classified as Level 2 measurements because while they are valued using the Bank s multi-currency accounting system, significant management judgment or estimation is not required.  The fair value of the Visa Class B restricted shares to Class A unrestricted common shares conversion rate swap agreements represent the amount owed by the Company to the buyer of the Visa Class B shares as a result of a reduction of the conversion ratio subsequent to the sales date.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the conversion rate swap agreement was valued at   zero   as reductions to the conversion ratio were neither probable nor reasonably estimable by management.  See Note 11   Derivative Financial Instruments   for more information. 
    
  The Company is exposed to credit risk if borrowers or counterparties fail to perform.  The Company seeks to minimize credit risk through credit approvals, limits, monitoring procedures, and collateral requirements.  The Company generally enters into transactions with borrowers and counterparties that carry high quality credit ratings.  Credit risk associated with borrowers or counterparties as well as the Company s non-performance risk is factored into the determination of the fair value of derivative financial instruments.

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the changes in Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: 

1   
    Realized and unrealized gains and losses related to mortgage servicing rights are reported as a component of mortgage banking income in the Company s consolidated statements of income. 
               2   
    Realized and unrealized gains and losses related to interest rate lock commitments are reported as a component of mortgage banking income in the Company s consolidated statements of income.  Realized and unrealized gains and losses related to interest rate swap agreements are reported as a component of other noninterest income in the Company s consolidated statements of income. 
     
   43 

     Table of Contents  

For Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements were as follows: 

1   
    Represents annualized loan repayment rate assumption. 
               2   
    Derived from multiple interest rate scenarios that incorporate a spread to a market yield curve and market volatilities. 
     The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s mortgage servicing rights are the weighted-average constant prepayment rate and weighted-average discount rate. Significant increases (decreases) in any of those inputs in isolation could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.  Although the constant prepayment rate and the discount rate are not directly interrelated, they generally move in opposite directions of each other. 
    
  The Company estimates the fair value of mortgage servicing rights by using a discounted cash flow model to calculate the present value of estimated future net servicing income.  The Company s Treasury Division enters observable and unobservable inputs into the model to arrive at an estimated fair value.  To assess the reasonableness of the fair value measurement, the Treasury Division performs a back-test by applying the model to historical prepayment data.  The fair value and constant prepayment rate are also compared to forward-looking estimates to assess reasonableness.  The Treasury Division also compares the fair value of the Company s mortgage servicing rights to a value calculated by an independent third party.  Discussions are held with members from the Treasury, Mortgage Banking, and Controllers Divisions, along with the independent third party to discuss and reconcile the fair value estimates and key assumptions used by the respective parties in arriving at those estimates.  A subcommittee of the Company s Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for providing oversight over the valuation methodology and key assumptions. 
    
  The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s IRLCs is the closing ratio, which represents the percentage of loans currently in a lock position which management estimates will ultimately close.  Generally, the fair value of an IRLC is positive (negative) if the prevailing interest rate is lower (higher) than the IRLC rate.  Therefore, an increase in the closing ratio (i.e., higher percentage of loans are estimated to close) will increase the gain or loss.  The closing ratio is largely dependent on the loan processing stage that a loan is currently in and the change in prevailing interest rates from the time of the rate lock.  The closing ratio is computed by our secondary marketing system using historical data and the ratio is periodically reviewed by the Company s Secondary Marketing Department of the Mortgage Banking Division for reasonableness. 
    
  The unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s interest rate swap agreements is the credit factor.  This factor represents the risk that a counterparty is either unable or unwilling to settle a transaction in accordance with the underlying contractual terms.  A significant increase (decrease) in the credit factor could result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.  The credit factor is determined by the Treasury Division based on the risk rating assigned to each counterparty in which the Company holds a net asset position.  The Company s Credit Policy Committee periodically reviews and approves the Expected Default Frequency of the Economic Capital Model for Credit Risk.  The Expected Default Frequency is used as the credit factor for interest rate swap agreements.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
    
  The Company may be required periodically to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP.  These adjustments to fair value usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-fair value accounting or impairment write-downs of individual assets.  The following table represents the assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

The write-down of mortgage servicing rights accounted for under the amortization method was primarily due to changes in certain key assumptions used to estimate fair value.  As previously mentioned, all of the Company's mortgage servicing rights are classified as Level 3 measurements due to the use of significant unobservable inputs, as well as significant management judgment and estimation.  The Company's equipment held for sale at December 31, 2015 represented   six   aircraft that were previously on lease agreements.  An impairment charge of   $9.5 million   (included in other noninterest expense in the Company's consolidated statements of income) was recorded in the third quarter of 2015 to reduce the carrying value to estimated fair value less cost to sell based on recent appraisals, market conditions, and management judgment.  Due to the use of significant unobservable inputs combined with significant management judgment regarding the fair value of the   six   aircraft, the carrying value was deemed a Level 3 measurement.  All aircraft were sold in 2016 resulting in a nominal loss on sale from the reduced carrying value. 
    
  Fair Value Option 
    
  The Company elects the fair value option for all residential mortgage loans held for sale.  This election allows for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans held for sale and the derivative financial instruments used to financially hedge them without having to apply complex hedge accounting requirements.  As noted above, the fair value of the Company s residential mortgage loans held for sale was determined based on quoted prices for similar loans in active markets. 
    
  The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the Company s residential mortgage loans held for sale as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Changes in the estimated fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale are reported as a component of mortgage banking income in the Company s consolidated statements of income.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the net gains or losses from the change in fair value of the Company s residential mortgage loans held for sale were not material.

Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
    
  The assumptions used below are expected to approximate those that market participants would use in valuing these financial instruments. 
    
  Investment Securities Held-to-Maturity 
    
  The fair value of the Company s investment securities held-to-maturity was primarily measured using information from a third-party pricing service.  Level 1 investment securities are comprised of debt securities issued by the U.S. Treasury as quoted prices were available, unadjusted, for identical securities in active markets.  If quoted prices were not available, fair values were estimated primarily by obtaining quoted prices for similar assets in active markets or through the use of pricing models.  In cases where there may be limited or less transparent information provided by the Company s third-party pricing service, fair value may be estimated by the use of secondary pricing services or through the use of non-binding third-party broker quotes. 
    
  Loans 
    
  The fair value of the Company s loans was estimated by discounting the expected future cash flows using the current interest rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.  Loans were first segregated by type such as commercial, real estate, and consumer, and were then further segmented into fixed and variable rate.  Expected future cash flows were projected based on contractual cash flows, adjusted for estimated prepayments. 
    
  Time Deposits 
    
  The fair value of the Company s time deposits was calculated using discounted cash flow analyses, applying discount rates based on market yield curve rates for similar maturities.  The fair values of the Company s time deposit liabilities do not take into consideration the value of the Company s long-term relationships with depositors, which may have significant value. 
    
  Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 
    
  The fair value of the Company s securities sold under agreements to repurchase was calculated using discounted cash flow analyses, applying discount rates based on market yield curve rates for similar maturities. 
    
  Other Debt 
    
  The fair value of the Company s other debt was calculated using a discounted cash flow analyses, applying discount rates based on market yield curve rates for similar maturities.

The following presents the carrying amount, fair value, and placement in the fair value hierarchy of the Company s financial instruments not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  This table excludes financial instruments for which the carrying amount approximates fair value.  For short-term financial assets such as cash and cash equivalents, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to the relatively short time between the origination of the instrument and its expected realization.  For non-marketable equity securities such as Federal Home Loan Bank and Federal Reserve Bank stock, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value as these securities can only be redeemed or sold at their par value and only to the respective issuing government supported institution or to another member institution.  For financial liabilities such as noninterest-bearing demand, interest-bearing demand, and savings deposits, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to these products having no stated maturity.

  Hawaii Economy 
    
  General economic conditions in Hawaii remained positive during the   third   quarter of   2016   including a strong tourism industry, a robust real estate market, and an active construction industry.  The unemployment rate in Hawaii remained relatively low.  For the first eight months of   2016  , total visitor arrivals increased 2.6% while total visitor spending increased 3.0% compared to the same period in   2015  .  The statewide seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate was 3.3% in September 2016 compared to 5.0% nationally.  For the   first nine months   of   2016  , the volume of single-family home sales on Oahu increased 4.8%, while the volume of condominium sales on Oahu increased 9.0% compared with the same period in   2015  .  The median price of single-family home sales and condominium sales on Oahu increased 5.2% and 8.7%, respectively, for the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .    As of September 30, 2016  , months of inventory of single-family homes and condominiums on Oahu remained low at 2.9 months and 3.0 months, respectively. 

Earnings Summary 
    
  Net income for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $43.5 million  ,   an increase   of   $9.2 million   or   27%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Diluted earnings per share was   $1.02   for the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $0.23   or   29%   compared to the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Our   higher   earnings for the   third   quarter of   2016   were primarily due to the following:   

Other noninterest expense for the third quarter of 2016 was $16.3 million, a decrease of $8.5 million or 34% compared to the same period in   2015  .  This decrease was primarily due to a $9.5 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2015 on six aircraft which were previously on lease agreements.  All aircraft were sold in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in a nominal loss on sale from the reduced carrying value.  The decrease in noninterest expense was partially offset by our increased investment in solar energy tax credit partnerships, which caused the related amortization expense to increase by $0.7 million.  However, the federal and state tax benefits related to these partnership investments resulted in a net benefit to overall net income.  The tax benefits are recorded as a reduction to income tax expense. 
                
    Net interest income for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   $103.9 million  ,   an increase   of   $6.0 million   or   6%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, combined with a higher net interest margin.  The higher level of earning assets was primarily due to higher deposit balances.  Our net interest margin was   2.80  % in the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   an increase   of   3   basis points compared to the same period in   2015  .  The higher margin in 2016 was primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2015. 
                
    Mortgage banking income for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $6.4 million, an increase of $3.1 million or 93% compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to higher loan production and sales of conforming saleable loans from our mortgage portfolio. 
                
    Other noninterest income for the third quarter of 2016 was $5.0 million, an increase of $2.3 million or 87% compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a $1.2 million increase in fees for our customer interest rate swap derivatives.  In addition, in the third quarter of 2015 we recorded a $1.0 million loss on the pending sale of an aircraft lease.

These items were partially offset by the following: 

Provision for income taxes for the third quarter of 2016 was $18.5 million, an increase of $3.6 million or 24% compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to higher pretax income.  The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 29.84%, down from 30.37% for the same period in 2015.  The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to the release of  reserves from a settlement with the IRS related to prior tax years, increased energy tax credits from solar energy tax credit partnerships and the release of state tax reserves due to the lapse in the statute of limitations related to prior tax years.  
                
    Salaries and benefits expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $49.7 million, an increase of   $3.1 million   or   7%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in incentive compensation.  Salaries expense increased by $0.5 million primarily due to merit increases.  Medical, dental, and life insurance increased by $0.5 million due to higher medical claims in our self-insured plan.  Commission expense increased by $0.4 million primarily due to an increase in loan origination and refinance activity. 
                
    We recorded a $2.5 million provision for credit losses in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to no provision recorded in the same period in 2015.  We determined that the allowance for loan and lease losses should be $104.0 million as of September  30, 2016. 
                
    Net occupancy expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   was $8.5 million, an increase of $1.1 million or 15% compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a $1.7 million gain on the sale of two real estate properties in Guam during the third quarter of 2015.  This increase was partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in utilities expense primarily due to lower electricity rates and usage. 
     Net income for the   first nine months   of   2016   was   $137.9 million  ,   an increase   of   $20.1 million   or   17%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Diluted earnings per share was   $3.21   for the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $0.50   or   18%   compared to the same period in   2015  . 
  Our   higher   earnings for the   first nine months   of   2016   were primarily due to the following:   

Net interest income for the   first nine months   of   2016   was   $310.5 million  ,   an increase   of   $18.0 million   or   6%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin.  The higher level of earning assets was primarily due to higher deposit balances.  In addition, we also recorded an additional $1.3 million of interest income in the first quarter of 2016 due to the full recovery of a non-performing commercial and industrial loan.  Our net interest margin was   2.84  % for the   first nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   5   basis points compared to the same period in   2015  .  The higher margin in 2016 was primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earnings assets compared to 2015.  The higher margin in 2016 was also due to the aforementioned interest income recovery. 
                
    Other noninterest expense for the   first nine months   of   2016   was $47.2 million, a decrease of $6.4 million or 12% compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to the aforementioned $9.5 million impairment charge on six aircraft in the third quarter of 2015.  This decrease was partially offset by our increased investment in solar energy tax credit partnerships, which caused the related amortization expense to increase by $1.2 million.  We also experienced an increase in temporary employment services ($0.9 million) and advertising ($0.6 million). 
                
    Mortgage banking income for the   first nine months   of   2016   was $13.6 million, an increase of $5.2 million or 61% compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to higher loan production and sales of conforming saleable loans from our mortgage portfolio.  This increase was partially offset by a $2.1 million valuation impairment to our mortgage servicing rights primarily due to the decline in interest rates. 
                
    Other noninterest income for the   first nine months   of   2016   was $14.6 million, an increase of $4.4 million or 44% compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in net gain on sale of previously leased assets, and a $1.7 million increase in fees for our customer interest rate swap derivatives.  Also contributing to the increase was the aforementioned $1.0 million loss on the pending sale of an aircraft lease in the third quarter of 2015. 
                
    Net occupancy expense for the   first nine months   of   2016   was $22.7 million, a decrease of $2.7 million or 11% compared to the same period in   2015  .  This decrease was primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in gains on the sale of real property.  In addition, utilities expense decreased by $0.8 million primarily due to lower electricity rates and usage.  Net rental expense also decreased by $0.5 million.

    Provision for income taxes for the   first nine months   of   2016   was $60.9 million, an increase of $7.2 million or 13% compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to higher pretax income.  The effective tax rate for the   first nine months   of   2016   was 30.62%, down from 31.28% for the same period in 2015.  The lower effective tax rate was due to the aforementioned release of federal and state tax reserves and the release of state tax reserves in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher pretax income compared to a fixed amount of tax credits. 
                
    Salaries and benefits expense for the   first nine months   of   2016   was $150.5 million, an increase of $6.6 million or 5% compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a $3.9 million increase in incentive compensation and a $2.3 million increase in salaries expense.  Medical, dental, and life insurance increased by $1.6 million due to higher medical claims in our self-insured plan.  Commission expense increased by $0.4 million primarily due to an increase in loan origination and refinance activity.  These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in separation expense. 
                
    We recorded a $1.5 million provision for credit losses for the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to no provision recorded in the same period in 2015.  We determined that the allowance for loan and lease losses should be $104.0 million as of September  30, 2016. 
     We maintained a strong balance sheet during the   third   quarter of   2016  , with what we believe are adequate reserves for credit losses and high levels of liquidity and capital. 
              
    The allowance for loan and lease losses (the  Allowance ) was   $104.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $1.2 million   or   1%   from   December 31, 2015  .  The Allowance represents   1.20%   of total loans and leases outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   1.31%   of total loans and leases outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  .  The level of our Allowance was commensurate with the Company's credit risk profile, loan portfolio growth and composition, and a healthy Hawaii economy. 
                
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the total carrying value of our investment securities portfolio was   $6.0 billion  ,   a decrease   of   $210.2 million   or   3%   compared to   December 31, 2015  .  During the first   nine months   of   2016  , we continued to reduce our positions in mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae.  We re-invested these proceeds primarily into higher yielding loan products.  In addition, we increased our holdings in Small Business Administration securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities continue to be our largest concentration in our portfolio. 
                 
    Total shareholders  equity was   $1.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $47.6 million   or   4%   from   December 31, 2015  .  We continued to return capital to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends.  During the first   nine months   of   2016  , we repurchased   772,658   shares of our common stock at a total cost of   $51.4 million   under our share repurchase program and from shares purchased from employees and/or directors in connection with income tax withholdings related to the vesting of restricted stock, shares purchased for a deferred compensation plan, and stock swaps, less shares distributed from the deferred compensation plan.  We also paid cash dividends of   $60.7 million   during the first   nine months   of   2016  .

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The ratios  tangible common equity to tangible assets  and  tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets  are Non-GAAP financial measures.  The Company believes these measurements are useful for investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate capital adequacy relative to other financial institutions.  Although these Non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a financial institution, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.  Table 2 provides a reconciliation of these Non-GAAP financial measures with their most closely related GAAP measures.

Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income is affected by the size and mix of our balance sheet components as well as the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities.  Net interest margin is defined as net interest income, on a taxable-equivalent basis, as a percentage of average earning assets. 
  Net interest income was $  103.9 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of $  6.0 million   or   6%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was   $106.9 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $6.0 million   or   6%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  Net interest income was   $310.5 million   for the first   nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $18.0 million   or   6%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  On a taxable-equivalent basis, net interest income was   $319.4 million   for the first   nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   $18.0 million   or   6%   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a higher level of earning assets, including growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios, and higher net interest margin.  The higher level of earning assets was primarily due to higher deposit balances.  In addition, we recorded an additional $1.3 million of interest income in the first quarter of 2016 due to the

full recovery of a non-performing commercial and industrial loan.  Net interest margin was   2.80%   for the   third quarter   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   three   basis points compared to the same period in   2015  .  Net interest margin was   2.84%   for the first   nine months   of   2016  ,   an increase   of   five   basis points compared to the same period in   2015  .  The   higher   margins in   2016   were primarily due to our loans, which generally have higher yields than our investment securities, comprising a larger percentage of our earning assets compared to 2015.  The higher margin in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to the same period in 2015 was also due to the aforementioned interest income recovery.  
  Yields on our earning assets   increased by     four   basis points in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   five   basis points for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to the aforementioned shift in the mix of our earning assets from investment securities to loans which generally have higher yields.  Yields on our commercial and industrial portfolio   increased by     11   basis points in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   32   basis points for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to higher year-over-year rates on floating rate loans and due to the aforementioned interest income recovered on non-performing loans in the first quarter of 2016.  Yields on our commercial mortgage portfolio   decreased by     24   basis points in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   nine   basis points for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  .  The yield decrease in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily due to a reversal of $0.8 million for an interest recovery previously recorded in the second quarter of 2016.  Contributing to the yield increase in earning assets in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was a   four   basis points yield increase in our investment securities portfolio primarily due lower premium amortization.  Partially offsetting the overall yield increase in our earning assets were lower yields in our residential mortgage portfolio and slightly higher funding costs.  Yields on our residential mortgage portfolio   decreased by     13   basis points in both the   third quarter   and the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due to continued payoff activity of higher-rate mortgage loans and the addition of lower-rate mortgage loans to our portfolio.  In addition, yield on our investment securities portfolio   decreased by     two   basis points in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to reinvestment into lower yielding securities, a reflection of the continued low interest rate environment, partially offset by lower premium amortization.  Funding costs rose slightly in   2016   compared to   2015  .  Interest rates paid on our time deposits   increased by     23   basis points in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   20   basis points for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due to new public time deposits at higher rates.  Interest rates paid on our securities sold under agreements to repurchase   increased by     18   basis points in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   27   basis points for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due to a decrease in repurchase agreements with local government entities which have relatively shorter terms at lower interest rates.  The remaining balance in our repurchase agreements consists mainly of those with private entities which have relatively longer terms at higher interest rates. 
  Average balances of our earning assets   increased by     $687.8 million   or   5%   in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   $628.4 million   or   4%   in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to an increase in the average balances of our loans and leases.  Average balances of our loans and leases portfolio   increased by     $937.6 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   $908.9 million   in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to higher average balances in our commercial mortgage, residential mortgage, and home equity portfolios.  The average balance of our commercial mortgage portfolio   increased by     $162.0 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   $195.8 million   in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to increased demand from new and existing customers as the real estate market in Hawaii continued to improve.  The average balance of our residential mortgage portfolio   increased by     $250.5 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   $268.6 million   in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to an increase in loan origination and refinance activity.  The average balance of our home equity portfolio   increased by     $293.1 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   $260.7 million   in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   due in large part to the strong economy.  In addition, we experienced steady line utilization during the first   nine months   of   2016  .  Partially offsetting the increase in the average balances of our loans and leases portfolio was a   $374.9 million     decrease   in the average balance of our total investment securities portfolio in the   third quarter   of   2016   and a   $387.4 million     decrease   in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to the shift in the mix of our earning assets from investment securities to loans. 
  Average balances of our interest-bearing liabilities   increased by     $317.8 million   or   3%   in the   third quarter   of   2016   and by   $241.5 million   or   2%     in the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to continued growth in our relationship checking and savings deposit products. 
   
  Provision for Credit Losses 
    
  The provision for credit losses (the "Provision") reflects our judgment of the expense or benefit necessary to achieve the appropriate amount of the Allowance.  We maintain the Allowance at levels we believe adequate to cover our estimate of probable credit losses as of the end of the reporting period.  The Allowance is determined through detailed quarterly analyses of the loan and lease portfolio.  The Allowance is based on our loss experience and changes in the economic environment, as well  
  
   56 

     Table of Contents  

as an ongoing assessment of credit quality.  Additional factors that are considered in determining the amount of the Allowance are the level of net charge-offs, non-performing assets, risk rating migration, as well as changes in our portfolio size and composition.  We recorded a provision of   $2.5 million   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to no provision in the same period in 2015.  Our decision to record a provision is reflective of our evaluation as to the adequacy of the Allowance.  For the first nine months of 2016, we recorded a provision of   $1.5 million   compared to no provision for the same period in 2015.  For further discussion on the Allowance, see  Corporate Risk Profile - Reserve for Credit Losses  in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Noninterest Income 
    
  Noninterest income   increased   by   $4.9 million   or   11%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   and by   $9.4 million   or   7%   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  .  
    
  Table 5 presents the components of noninterest income. 

Trust and asset management income is comprised of fees earned from the management and administration of trusts and other customer assets.  These fees are largely based upon the market value of the assets we manage and the fee rate charged to customers.  Total trust assets under administration were $9.0 billion as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Trust and asset management income decreased by $0.9 million or 8% in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in 2015.  This decrease was primarily due to a $0.7 million decrease in special service fees, mainly the result of termination fees received in the third quarter of 2015.  Trust and asset management income decreased by $1.5 million or 4% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in employee benefit trust fees ($0.8 million), agency fees ($0.5 million), common trust fund fees ($0.4 million) and other trust fees ($0.4 million) primarily due to a decline in the number of customer accounts under administration.  This decrease was partially offset by a $0.7 million increase in special services fees mainly the result of a $1.2 million service fee received from the sale of real estate in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by the aforementioned termination fees received in the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Mortgage banking income is highly influenced by mortgage interest rates, the housing market, the amount of saleable loans we sell, and also our valuation of mortgage servicing rights.  Mortgage banking income increased by $3.1 million or 93% in the third quarter of 2016 and by $5.2 million or 61% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015.  This increase was primarily due to higher loan production and sales of conforming saleable loans from our mortgage portfolio.  The year-to-date increase in mortgage banking income was partially offset by a $2.1 million valuation impairment to our mortgage servicing rights, recorded in the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to the decline in interest rates. 
    
  Fees, exchange, and other service charges are primarily comprised of debit and credit card income, fees from ATMs, merchant service activity, and other loan fees and service charges.  Fees, exchange, and other service charges increased by $0.7 million or 5% in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a $0.4 million increase in debit card income due largely to increased transaction volume.  Fees, exchange, and other service charges increased by $1.9 million or 5% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  This increase was primarily due to a $1.0 million increase in debit card income, a $0.6 million increase in other loan fees, and a $0.6 million increase in credit card commissions and fees. 
    
  Net losses on sales of investment securities totaled $0.3 million in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to a net gain of less than $0.1 million during the same period in   2015  .  The net loss in the current quarter was due to quarterly fees paid to the counterparties of our prior Visa Class B share sale transactions.  Net gains on sales of investment securities totaled $10.5 million for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $10.3 million during the same period in 2015.  The net gain in 2016 was  
  
   57 

     Table of Contents  

due to an $11.2 million gain on the sale of 100,000 Visa Class B shares during the first quarter of 2016.  The net gain in 2015 was primarily due to a $10.1 million gain on the sale of 95,000 Visa Class B shares during the first quarter of 2015.  We received these Class B shares in 2008 as part of Visa's initial public offering.  These shares are transferable only under limited circumstances until they can be converted into the publicly traded Class A shares.  This conversion will not occur until the settlement of certain litigation which is indemnified by Visa members such as the Company.  Visa funded an escrow account from its initial public offering to settle these litigation claims.  Should this escrow account be insufficient to cover these litigation claims, Visa is entitled to fund additional amounts to the escrow account by reducing each member bank's Class B conversion ratio to unrestricted Class A shares.  Concurrent with the sale of these Visa Class B shares, we entered into an agreement with the buyer that requires payment to the buyer in the event Visa further reduces the conversion ratio.  Based on the existing transfer restriction and the uncertainty of the covered litigation, the remaining 184,814 Visa Class B shares (304,629 Class A equivalent shares) that we own are carried at a zero cost basis.  We also contributed to the Bank of Hawaii Foundation 3,900 and 4,500 Visa Class B shares during the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, we contributed 3,900 and 13,800 Visa Class B shares, respectively, to the Bank of Hawaii Foundation. 
    
  Bank-owned life insurance increased by $0.3 million or 19% in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a $0.3 million death benefit received in the current quarter.  Bank-owned life insurance decreased by $0.4 million or 8% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a $0.6 million death benefit received in the second quarter of 2015, partially offset by the aforementioned $0.3 million death benefit received in the current quarter. 
    
  Other noninterest income increased by $2.3 million or 87% in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a $1.2 million increase in fees for our customer interest rate swap derivatives.  In addition, in the third quarter of 2015 we recorded a $1.0 million loss on the pending sale of an aircraft lease.  The sale closed in the fourth quarter of 2015.  Other noninterest income increased by $4.4 million or 44% for the first nine months of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a $1.7 million increase in net gain on sale of previously leased assets, and a $1.7 million increase in fees for our customer interest rate swap derivatives.  Also contributing to the increase was the aforementioned $1.0 million loss on the pending sale of an aircraft lease in the third quarter of 2015.

Noninterest Expense 
    
  Noninterest expense   decreased   by   $4.4 million   or   5%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   and by   $1.4 million   or   1%   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same periods in   2015  . 
    
  Table 6 presents the components of noninterest expense. 

Salaries and benefits expense   increased   by   $3.1 million   or   7%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a $1.5 million increase in incentive compensation.  Salaries expense increased by $0.5 million primarily due to merit increases.  Medical, dental, and life insurance increased by $0.5 million due to higher medical claims in our self-insured plan.  Commission expense increased by $0.4 million primarily due to an increase in loan origination and refinance activity.  Salaries and benefits expense   increased   by   $6.6 million   or   5%   for the first   nine months   of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a $3.9 million increase in incentive compensation.  Salaries expense increased by $2.3 million primarily due to merit increases and one additional paid working day in the first quarter of 2016.  Medical, dental, and life insurance increased by $1.6 million due to higher medical claims in our self-insured plan.  Commission expense increased by $0.4 million primarily due to an increase in loan origination and refinance activity.  These increases were partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in separation expense. 
    
  Net occupancy expense increased by $1.1 million or 15% in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a $1.7 million gain on the sale of two real estate properties in Guam during the third quarter of 2015.  This increase was partially offset by a $0.3 million decrease in utilities expense primarily due to lower electricity rates and usage.  Net occupancy expense decreased by $2.7 million or 11% for the first nine months of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This decrease was primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in gains on the sale of real estate property.  In addition, utilities expense decreased by $0.8 million primarily due to lower electricity rates and usage.  Net rental expense also decreased by $0.5 million. 
    
  Other noninterest expense decreased by $8.5 million or 34% in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015  .  This decrease was primarily due to a $9.5 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2015 on six aircraft which were previously on lease agreements.  All aircraft were sold in the first quarter of 2016 resulting in a nominal loss on sale from the reduced carrying value.  The decrease in noninterest expense was partially offset by our increased investment in solar energy tax credit partnerships, which caused the related amortization expense to increase by $0.7 million.  However, the federal and  
  
   59 

     Table of Contents  

state tax benefits related to these partnership investments resulted in a net benefit to overall net income.  The tax benefits are recorded as a reduction to income tax expense.  Other noninterest expense decreased by $6.4 million or 12% for the first nine months of   2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to the aforementioned $9.5 million impairment charge on six aircraft in the third quarter of 2015.  This decrease was partially offset by our increased investment in solar energy tax credit partnerships, which caused the related amortization expense to increase by $1.2 million.  We also experienced an increase in temporary employment services ($0.9 million) and advertising ($0.6 million). 

Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  Table 7 presents our provision for income taxes and effective tax rates. 

The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 29.84%, down from 30.37 % for the same period in 2015. The lower effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to the release of reserves from a settlement with the IRS related to prior tax years, increased energy tax credits from solar energy tax credit partnerships and the release of state tax reserves due to the lapse in the statute of limitations related to prior tax years.   
    
  The effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was 30.62%, down from 31.28% for the same period in 2015. The lower effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015 was due to the aforementioned release of federal and state  tax reserves and the release of state tax reserves in the second quarter of 2016, partially offset by higher pretax income compared to a fixed amount of tax credits.

Investment Securities 
    
  The carrying value of our investment securities portfolio was   $6.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $210.2 million   or   3%   compared to   December 31, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , our investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of   approximately 2.6 years  . 
    
  We continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed.  These evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities, change the composition of our investment securities portfolio, and change the proportion of investments made into the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment categories. 
    
  During the   first nine months   of   2016  , we continued to reduce our positions in mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae.  We re-invested these proceeds primarily into higher-yielding loan products.  In addition, we increased our holdings in Small Business Administration securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities continue to be our largest concentration in our portfolio.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our portfolio of Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities was primarily comprised of securities issued in 2008 or later.  As of   September 30, 2016  , these mortgage-backed securities were all AAA-rated, with a low probability of a change in their credit ratings in the near future.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of   approximately 2.2 years  . 
    
  Gross unrealized gains in our investment securities portfolio were   $123.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $84.9 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Gross unrealized losses on our temporarily impaired investment securities were   $12.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $40.5 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  The gross unrealized loss positions were primarily related to mortgage-backed securities issued by Ginnie Mae and corporate debt securities.  See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , included in our investment securities portfolio were debt securities issued by political subdivisions within the State of Hawaii of   $543.8 million  , representing   57%   of the total fair value of the Company's municipal debt securities.  Of the entire Hawaii municipal bond portfolio,   94%   were credit-rated Aa2 or better by Moody's while the remaining Hawaii municipal bonds were credit-rated A2 or better by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization.  Approximately   77%   of our Hawaii municipal bond holdings were general obligation issuances.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no other holdings of municipal debt securities that were issued by a single state or political subdivision which comprised more than   10%   of the total fair value of our municipal debt securities.

Loans and Leases 
    
  Table 8 presents the composition of our loan and lease portfolio by major categories. 

1   
    Comprised of other revolving credit, installment, and lease financing. 
       
  Total loans and leases as of   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $815.1 million   or   10%   from   December 31, 2015   due to growth in both our commercial and consumer lending portfolios. 
    
  Commercial loans and leases as of   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $335.7 million   or   11%   from   December 31, 2015  .  Commercial and industrial loans   increased   by   $102.7 million   or   9%   from   December 31, 2015   due to an increase in corporate demand for funding.  Commercial mortgage loans   increased   by   $130.0 million   or   8%   from   December 31, 2015   primarily due to increased demand from new and existing customers as the Hawaii economy continues to be strong.  Construction loans   increased   by   $106.4 million   or   68%   from   December 31, 2015   primarily due to increased activity in construction projects such as condominiums and low-income housing.  Lease financing   decreased   by   $3.4 million   or   2%   from   December 31, 2015   primarily due to paydowns. 
    
  Consumer loans and leases as of   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $479.4 million   or   10%   from   December 31, 2015  .  Residential mortgage loans   increased   by   $173.3 million   or   6%   from   December 31, 2015   primarily due to an increase in loan origination and refinance activity.  Home equity lines and loans   increased   by   $226.6 million   or   21%   from   December 31, 2015   due in large part to the strong economy.  In addition, we experienced steady line utilization during the   first nine months   of 2016.  Automobile loans   increased   by   $55.9 million   or   15%   from   December 31, 2015   primarily driven by market share gains and steady consumer demand.  Other consumer loans   increased by     $23.6 million   or   7%   from   December 31, 2015   primarily due to growth in our automobile leasing portfolio.

    For secured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on where the collateral is located.  For unsecured loans and leases, classification as U.S. Mainland is made based on the location where the majority of the borrower s business operations are conducted. 
               2   
    Loans and leases classified as Foreign represent those which are recorded in the Company s international business units.

    Comprised of other revolving credit, installment, and lease financing. 
       
  Our commercial and consumer lending activities are concentrated primarily in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  Our commercial loan and lease portfolio to borrowers based on the U.S. Mainland includes leveraged lease financing and participation in Shared National Credits.  Our consumer loan and lease portfolio includes limited lending activities on the U.S. Mainland. 
    
  Our Hawaii loan and lease portfolio   increased   by   $802.3 million   or   11%   from   December 31, 2015  , reflective of a healthy Hawaii economy.

Other Assets 
    
  Table 10 presents the major components of other assets. 

Other assets   increase  d by   $5.5 million   or   3%   from   December 31, 2015  .  This increase was primarily due to a $6.5 million increase in derivative financial instruments, primarily the result of additional interest rate swap agreements combined with a higher fair value of our existing interest rate swap agreements.  The fair values of these swap agreements are impacted by interest rate movements.  Due to our risk mitigating strategies in structuring these agreements, our asset position is offset by a similar offsetting balance in other liabilities.  Also contributing to the increase is a $1.7 million increase in prepaid expenses and a $1.5 million increase in deferred compensation assets.  These increases were partially offset by the sale of six aircraft ($4.7 million carrying value as of December 31, 2015) that were previously on lease agreements. 

Deposits 
    
  Table 11 presents the composition of our deposits by major customer categories. 

Total deposits were   $13.8 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $557.3 million   or   4%   from   December 31, 2015  .      This   increase   was primarily due to a $335.9 million increase in consumer deposits primarily due to continued growth in our relationship savings deposit products.  In addition, commercial deposits increased by $248.4 million, mainly reflecting core deposit growth.  These increases were partially offset by a $27.0 million decrease in public and other deposits primarily due to a decrease in public demand deposits.

Securities Sold Under Agreements to Repurchase 
    
  Table 13 presents the composition of our securities sold under agreements to repurchase. 

Securities sold under agreements to repurchase as of   September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $77.2 million   or   12%   from   December 31, 2015  .  This decrease was primarily due to repurchase agreements maturing in 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average maturity was 112 days for our repurchase agreements with government entities and 3.1 years for our repurchase agreements with private institutions.  Some of our repurchase agreements with private institutions may be terminated at earlier specified dates by the private institution or in some cases by either the private institution or the Company.  If all such agreements were to terminate at the earliest possible date, the weighted-average maturity for our repurchase agreements with private institutions would decrease to 1.8 years.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average interest rate for outstanding agreements with government entities and private institutions was 0.28% and 4.16%, respectively, with all rates being fixed.  Each of our repurchase agreements is accounted for as a collateralized financing arrangement (i.e., a secured borrowing) and not as a sale and subsequent repurchase of securities.  

Other Debt 
    
  Table 14 presents the composition of our other debt. 

Other debt was   $268.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $22.2 million   or   9%   from   December 31, 2015  .  This   increase   was primarily due to three additional FHLB advances totaling $75.0 million taken during 2016, partially offset by a $50.0 million FHLB advance which matured during the first quarter of 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our ten FHLB advances totaled $250.0 million with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.28% and maturity dates ranging from 2018 to 2020.  These advances were primarily for asset/liability management purposes.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our remaining unused line of credit with the FHLB was   $1.6 billion  .

Analysis of Business Segments 
    
  Our business segments are defined as Retail Banking, Commercial Banking, Investment Services, and Treasury and Other. 

Table 15 summarizes net income from our business segments.  Additional information about segment performance is presented in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Retail Banking 
    
  Net income increased by $7.3 million or 55% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increases in the Provision and noninterest expense. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher average balances in both the lending and deposit portfolios as well as higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio.  The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to higher mortgage banking income as well as growth in our debit and credit card businesses.  The increase in mortgage banking income was primarily due to higher loan production and sales of conforming saleable loans from our mortgage portfolio.  The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher net charge-offs in our installment loan portfolio, partially offset by lower net charge-offs in our home equity loan portfolio.  The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense and higher allocated expenses for general administration, as well as lower occupancy related expenses in the third quarter of 2015 related to a gain on the sale of two real estate properties in Guam. 
    
  Net income increased by $17.9 million or 49% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income, partially offset by increases in the Provision and noninterest expense.  The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher average balances in both the lending and deposit portfolios as well as higher earnings credits on the segment's deposit portfolio.  The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to higher mortgage banking income as well as growth in our debit and credit card businesses.  The increase in mortgage banking income was primarily due to higher loan production and sales of conforming saleable loans from our mortgage portfolio.  This increase was partially offset by a $2.1 million valuation impairment to our mortgage servicing rights primarily due to a decline in interest rates.  The increase in the Provision was primarily due to higher net charge-offs in our installment loan and credit card portfolios and lower net recoveries of home equity loans previously charged off, partially offset by higher net recoveries of residential mortgage loans previously charged-off.  The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher salaries and benefits expense and higher allocated expenses for general administration, marketing, data processing and information technology.  This increase was partially offset by a $1.3 million gain on the sale of real estate property in Maui in the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  Commercial Banking 
    
  Net income increased by $7.2 million or 65% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income, and a decrease in noninterest expense.  The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher volume in both the lending and deposit portfolios, and higher earnings credits on the segment s deposit portfolio.  The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to higher fees for our customer interest rate swap derivatives and a $1.0 million loss on the pending sale of an aircraft lease in the prior year.  The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a $9.5 million impairment charge in the third quarter of 2015 on six aircraft which were previously on lease agreements. 
    
  Net income increased by $16.3 million or 39% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to increases in net interest income and noninterest income, and decreases in the Provision and noninterest expense.  The increase in net interest income was primarily due to higher volume in both the lending and deposit portfolios, and partially due  
  
   66 

     Table of Contents  

to higher earnings credits on the segment s deposit portfolio.  In addition, we recorded an additional $1.3 million of interest income in the first quarter of 2016 due to the full recovery of a non-performing commercial and industrial loan.  The increase in noninterest income was primarily due to a higher net gain on sale of previously leased assets and higher fees for our customer interest rate swap derivatives.  The decrease in the Provision was due to the aforementioned full recovery of the previously charged-off loan.  The decrease in noninterest expense was due to the aforementioned impairment charge on six aircraft in the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  Investment Services 
    
  Net income increased by $0.2 million or 5% in the third quarter of 2016 and by $1.6 million or 18% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015 primarily due an increase in net interest income, partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income and an increase in noninterest expense.  The increase in net interest income was due to higher volume resulting from the transfer of certain loans and deposits from the Retail Banking segment and higher earnings credits on the segment s deposit portfolio.  The decrease in noninterest income was primarily due to lower trust and asset management market values and lower fees related to the transition of various services provided to some institutional 401k plans.  The decrease in noninterest income in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was partially offset by a $1.2 million service fee received from the sale of real estate in the second quarter of 2016.  The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher allocated expenses. 
    
  Treasury and Other 
    
  Net income decreased by $5.5 million or 81% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net interest income, and increases in the Provision and noninterest expenses.  This was partially offset by a decrease in the provision for income taxes.  The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs and lower interest income from the investment securities portfolio resulting from a reduction in volume and lower associated yields, partially offset by an increase in funding income related to lending activities.  The Provision in this business segment represents the residual provision for credit losses to arrive at the total Provision for the Company.  The increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to higher amortization expense related to increased investment in solar energy tax credit partnerships.  The provision for income taxes in this business segment represents the residual amount to arrive at the total tax expense for the Company.  The overall effective tax rate decreased to 29.84% in the third quarter of 2016 compared to 30.37% in the same period in 2015. 
    
  Net income decreased by $15.8 million or 53% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily due to a decrease in net interest income and an increase in the Provision, partially offset by decreases in noninterest expenses and provision for income taxes.  The decrease in net interest income was primarily due to higher deposit funding costs and lower interest income from the investment securities portfolio resulting from a reduction in volume and lower associated yields, partially offset by an increase in funding income related to lending activities.  The Provision in this business segment represents the residual provision for credit losses to arrive at the total Provision for the Company.  The decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a decrease in separation expense, partially offset by the aforementioned higher amortization expense related to increased investment in solar energy tax credit partnerships.  The provision for income taxes in this business segment represents the residual amount to arrive at the total tax expense for the Company.  The overall effective tax rate decreased to 30.62% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 31.28% in the same period in 2015. 
    
  Other organizational units (Technology, Operations, Marketing, Human Resources, Finance, Credit and Risk Management, and Corporate and Regulatory Administration) included in Treasury and Other provide a wide range of support to the Company's other income earning segments.  Expenses incurred by these support units are charged to the business segments through an internal cost allocation process. 

Corporate Risk Profile 

Credit Risk 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our overall credit risk profile reflects a healthy Hawaii economy as our levels of non-performing assets and credit losses remain well controlled.  The underlying risk profile of our lending portfolio continued to remain strong during the first   nine months   of   2016  . 
    
  We actively manage exposures with deteriorating asset quality to reduce levels of potential loss exposure and closely monitor our reserves and capital to address both anticipated and unforeseen issues.  Risk management activities include detailed analysis of portfolio segments and stress tests of certain segments to ensure that reserve and capital levels are appropriate.  We

perform frequent loan and lease-level risk monitoring and risk rating reviews, which provide opportunities for early interventions to allow for credit exits or restructuring, loan and lease sales, and voluntary workouts and liquidations. 

Non-Performing Assets and Accruing Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More 
    
  Table 16 presents information on non-performing assets ( NPAs ) and accruing loans and leases past due 90 days or more.   

            1   
    Comprised of other revolving credit, installment, and lease financing. 
     
   68 

Table of Contents  

NPAs consist of non-accrual loans and leases, and foreclosed real estate.  Changes in the level of non-accrual loans and leases typically represent increases for loans and leases that reach a specified past due status, offset by reductions for loans and leases that are charged-off, paid down, sold, transferred to foreclosed real estate, or are no longer classified as non-accrual because they have returned to accrual status. 
    
  Total NPAs were   $18.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   of   $10.1 million   or   35%   from   December 31, 2015  .  The   decrease   was experienced in both the commercial and consumer lending portfolios.  The ratio of our NPAs to total loans and leases and foreclosed real estate was   0.21%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   0.37%   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Commercial and industrial non-accrual loans   decreased   by   $5.6 million   or   97%   from   December 31, 2015   due to payoffs.  In particular, one loan with a carrying value of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2015 was paid off during the first quarter of 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , three commercial borrowers comprised the entire non-accrual balance in this category. 
    
  Commercial mortgage non-accrual loans   decreased   by   $2.4 million   or   71%   from   December 31, 2015  .  The   decrease   was primarily due to the return of one loan to accrual status and paydowns on two loans.  We have individually evaluated the remaining commercial mortgage non-accrual loans for impairment and have recorded no partial charge-offs. 
    
  The largest component of our NPAs continues to be residential mortgage loans.  Residential mortgage non-accrual loans   decreased   by   $1.9 million   or   13%   from   December 31, 2015   primarily due to paydowns and payoffs.  In addition, two loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") were returned to accrual status.  Residential mortgage non-accrual loans remain at elevated levels due mainly to the lengthy judiciary foreclosure process as well as residential mortgage loan modifications the Bank entered into to assist borrowers wishing to remain in their residences despite having financial challenges.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our residential mortgage non-accrual loans were comprised of 31 loans with a weighted average current LTV ratio of 62%. 
    
  Foreclosed real estate represents property acquired as the result of borrower defaults on loans.  Foreclosed real estate is recorded at fair value, less estimated selling costs, at the time of foreclosure.  On an ongoing basis, properties are appraised as required by market conditions and applicable regulations.  Foreclosed real estate   increased   by   $0.9 million   or   112%   from   December 31, 2015   due to the addition of one property. 
    
  Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or More and Still Accruing Interest 
    
  Loans and leases in this category are 90 days or more past due, as to principal or interest, and are still accruing interest because they are well secured and in the process of collection.  Loans and leases past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were   $5.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , a   $1.9 million   or   25%     decrease   from   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Impaired Loans 
    
  Impaired loans are defined as loans for which we believe it is probable we will not collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Included in impaired loans are all classes of commercial non-accruing loans (except lease financing and small business loans), all loans modified in a TDR (including accruing TDRs), and other loans where we believe that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Impaired loans exclude lease financing and smaller balance homogeneous loans (consumer and small business non-accruing loans) that are collectively evaluated for impairment.  Impaired loans were $60.2 million as of   September 30, 2016   and $66.7 million as of   December 31, 2015  , and had a related Allowance of $3.4 million and $3.6 million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have recorded cumulative charge-offs of $16.0 million related to our total impaired loans.  Our impaired loans are considered in management's assessment of the overall adequacy of the Allowance.

  Loans modified in a TDR   decreased   by   $5.6 million   or   9%   from   December 31, 2015  .  This   decrease   was primarily due to the aforementioned loan payoff of one commercial and industrial loan with a carrying value of $4.3 million as of December 31, 2015.  Residential mortgage loans remain our largest TDR loan class.

               2   
    Included in this analysis is activity related to the Company s reserve for unfunded commitments, which is separately recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated statements of condition. 
       
  We maintain a reserve for credit losses that consists of two components, the Allowance and a reserve for unfunded commitments (the  Unfunded Reserve ).  The reserve for credit losses provides for the risk of credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and is based on loss estimates derived from a comprehensive quarterly evaluation.  The evaluation reflects analyses of individual borrowers and historical loss experience, supplemented as necessary by credit judgment that considers observable trends, conditions, and other relevant environmental and economic factors.  The level of the Allowance is adjusted by recording an expense or recovery through the Provision.  The level of the Unfunded Reserve is adjusted by recording an expense or recovery in other noninterest expense.

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Allowance was   $104.0 million   or   1.20%   of total loans and leases outstanding, compared with an Allowance of   $102.9 million   or   1.31%   of total loans and leases outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  .  The decrease in the ratio of Allowance to loans and leases outstanding was commensurate with the Company's credit risk profile, loan growth, and a healthy Hawaii economy. 
    
  Net charge-offs on loans and leases were   $2.4 million   or   0.11%   of total average loans and leases, on an annualized basis, in the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to net charge-offs of   $2.0 million   or   0.10%   of total average loans and leases, on an annualized basis, in the   third   quarter of   2015  .  Net charge-offs on loans and leases were   $0.3 million   or   0.01%   of total average loans and leases, on an annualized basis, in the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to net charge-offs of   $4.7 million   or   0.09%   of total average loans and leases, on an annualized basis, in the   first nine months   of   2015  .  All of our commercial portfolios were in net recovery positions in the   first nine months   of   2016  .  Net recoveries in our commercial portfolios were   $6.9 million   for the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to   $1.1 million   for the same period in   2015  .  Net recoveries in the   first nine months   of   2016   were primarily due to the recovery of one commercial and industrial loan.  Net charge-offs in our consumer portfolios were   $7.3 million   for the   first nine months   of   2016   compared to   $5.7 million   for the same period in   2015  .  The higher net charge-offs during the   first nine months   of   2016   were primarily in our other consumer loans portfolio. 
    
  Although we determine the amount of each component of the Allowance separately, the Allowance as a whole was considered appropriate by management as of   September 30, 2016  , based on our ongoing analysis of estimated probable credit losses, credit risk profiles, economic conditions, coverage ratios, and other relevant factors. 
    
  The Reserve for Unfunded Commitments 
    
  The Unfunded Reserve was   $6.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $0.5 million   from   December 31, 2015  .  This increase primarily reflects the growth in our commercial lending commitments.  The process used to determine the Unfunded Reserve is consistent with the process for determining the Allowance, as adjusted for estimated funding probabilities.

Market Risk 

Market risk is the potential of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and prices.  We are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities.  Our market risk management process involves measuring, monitoring, controlling, and mitigating risks that can significantly impact our statements of income and condition.  In this management process, market risks are balanced with expected returns in an effort to enhance earnings performance, while limiting volatility. 
    
  Our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  The objective of our interest rate risk management process is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity.  The potential cash flows, sales, or replacement value of many of our assets and liabilities, especially those that earn or pay interest, are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates.  This interest rate risk arises primarily from our core business activities of extending loans and accepting deposits.  Our investment securities portfolio is also subject to significant interest rate risk.       
    
  Many factors affect our exposure to changes in interest rates such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and repricing characteristics of financial instruments.  Our earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Bank (the  FRB ).  The monetary policies of the FRB can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities, and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities. 
    
  In managing interest rate risk, we, through the Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ), measure short and long-term sensitivities to changes in interest rates.  The ALCO, which is comprised of members of executive management, utilizes several techniques to manage interest rate risk, which include: 

adjusting the balance sheet mix or altering the interest rate characteristics of assets and liabilities; 
                
    changing product pricing strategies; 
                
    modifying characteristics of the investment securities portfolio; and 
                
    using derivative financial instruments. 
       
  Our use of derivative financial instruments, as detailed in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, has generally been limited.  This is due to natural on-balance sheet hedges arising out of offsetting interest rate exposures from loans and investment securities with deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities.  In particular, the investment securities portfolio is utilized to manage the interest rate exposure and sensitivity to within the guidelines and limits established by the ALCO.  We utilize natural and offsetting economic hedges in an effort to reduce the need to employ off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk exposures.  Expected movements in interest rates are also considered in managing interest rate risk.  Thus, as interest rates change, we may use different techniques to manage interest rate risk. 
    
  A key element in our ongoing process to measure and monitor interest rate risk is the utilization of an asset/liability simulation model that attempts to capture the dynamic nature of the balance sheet.  The model is used to estimate and measure the balance sheet sensitivity to changes in interest rates.  These estimates are based on assumptions about the behavior of loan and deposit pricing, repayment rates on mortgage-based assets, and principal amortization and maturities on other financial instruments.  The model s analytics include the effects of standard prepayment options on mortgages and customer withdrawal options for deposits.  While such assumptions are inherently uncertain, we believe that our assumptions are reasonable.

     Table of Contents  

We utilize net interest income simulations to analyze short-term income sensitivities to changes in interest rates.  Table 19 
  presents, for the twelve months subsequent to   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , an estimate of the change in net interest income that would result from a gradual and immediate change in interest rates, moving in a parallel fashion over the entire yield curve, relative to the measured base case scenario.  The base case scenario assumes the balance sheet and interest rates are generally unchanged.  Based on our net interest income simulation as of   September 30, 2016  , net interest income is expected to increase as interest rates rise.  This is due in part to our strategy to maintain a relatively short investment portfolio duration.  In addition, rising interest rates would drive higher rates on loans and investment securities, as well as induce a slower pace of premium amortization on certain securities within our investment portfolio.  However, lower interest rates would likely cause a decline in net interest income as lower rates would lead to lower yields on loans and investment securities, as well as drive higher premium amortization on existing investment securities.  Since deposit costs are already at low levels, we believe that lower interest rates are unlikely to significantly impact our funding costs.  Based on our net interest income simulation as of   September 30, 2016  , net interest income sensitivity to changes in interest rates for the twelve months subsequent to   September 30, 2016   was more sensitive compared to the sensitivity profile for the twelve months subsequent to   December 31, 2015  .  The increase in sensitivity was due to the impact of a lower interest rate environment on our residential mortgage assets as well as changes in our balance sheet mix, including increases in floating rate securities, and overall loan and core deposit growth.  Also contributing to the sensitivity increase was lengthening the tenor of our liabilities, including public funds and term debt. 

To analyze the impact of changes in interest rates in a more realistic manner, non-parallel interest rate scenarios are also simulated.  These non-parallel interest rate scenarios indicate that net interest income may decrease from the base case scenario should the yield curve flatten or become inverted for a period of time.  Conversely, if the yield curve should steepen, net interest income may increase. 
    
  Other Market Risks 
    
  In addition to interest rate risk, we are exposed to other forms of market risk in our normal business transactions.  Foreign currency and foreign exchange contracts expose us to a small degree of foreign currency risk.  These transactions are primarily executed on behalf of customers.  Our trust and asset management income are at risk to fluctuations in the market values of underlying assets, particularly debt and equity securities.  Also, our share-based compensation expense is dependent on the fair value of our stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock at the date of grant.  The fair value of stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock is impacted by the market price of the Parent s common stock on the date of grant and is at risk to changes in equity markets, general economic conditions, and other factors.

Liquidity Risk Management 
    
  The objective of our liquidity risk management process is to manage cash flow and liquidity in an effort to provide continuous access to sufficient, reasonably priced funds.  Funding requirements are impacted by loan originations and refinancings, deposit balance changes, liability issuances and settlements, and off-balance sheet funding commitments.  We consider and comply with various regulatory guidelines regarding required liquidity levels and periodically monitor our liquidity position in light of the changing economic environment and customer activity.  Based on periodic liquidity assessments, we may alter our asset, liability, and off-balance sheet positions.  The ALCO monitors sources and uses of funds and modifies asset and liability positions as liquidity requirements change.  This process, combined with our ability to raise funds in money and capital markets and through private placements, provides flexibility in managing the exposure to liquidity risk. 
    
  In an effort to satisfy our liquidity needs, we actively manage our assets and liabilities.  We have access to immediate liquid resources in the form of cash which is primarily on deposit with the FRB.  Potential sources of liquidity also include investment securities in our available-for-sale securities portfolio, our ability to sell loans in the secondary market, and to secure borrowings from the FRB and FHLB.  Our held-to-maturity securities, while not intended for sale, may also be utilized in repurchase agreements to obtain funding.  Our core deposits have historically provided us with a long-term source of stable and relatively lower cost source of funding.  Additional funding is available through the issuance of long-term debt or equity. 
    
  Maturities and payments on outstanding loans also provide a steady flow of funds.  Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , investment securities with a carrying value of   $133.8 million   were due to contractually mature in one year or less.  Liquidity is further enhanced by our ability to pledge loans to access secured borrowings from the FHLB and FRB.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we could have borrowed an additional   $1.6 billion   from the FHLB and an additional $651.5 million from the FRB based on the amount of collateral pledged. 
    
  We continued our focus on maintaining a strong liquidity position throughout the   first nine months   of   2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents were   $638.1 million  , the carrying value of our available-for-sale investment securities was   $2.2 billion  , and total deposits were   $13.8 billion  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , our available-for-sale investment securities portfolio was comprised of securities with an average base duration of   approximately 2.2 years  . 

Capital Management 
    
  We actively manage capital, commensurate with our risk profile, to enhance shareholder value.  We also seek to maintain capital levels for the Company and the Bank at amounts in excess of the regulatory "well-capitalized" thresholds.  Periodically, we may respond to market conditions by implementing changes to our overall balance sheet positioning to manage our capital position.  
    
  The Parent and the Bank are each subject to regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies.  Failure to meet minimum capital requirements could cause certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, would likely have a material effect on our financial statements.  Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative and qualitative measures.  These measures were established by regulation intended to ensure capital adequacy.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company and the Bank were considered  well capitalized  under this regulatory framework.  The Company s regulatory capital ratios are presented in Table 20 below.  There have been no conditions or events since   September 30, 2016   that management believes have changed either the Company s or the Bank s capital classifications. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , shareholders' equity was   $1.2 billion  ,   an increase   of   $47.6 million   or   4%   from   December 31, 2015  .

Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry 
    
  Basel III 
    
  The FRB and the FDIC approved the final rules implementing the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision's ( BCBS ) capital guidelines for U.S. banks.  Under the final rules, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.  The rules include a new common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0%, require a minimum ratio of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and require a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%.   A new capital conservation buffer, comprised of common equity Tier 1 capital, was also established above the regulatory minimum capital requirements.  This capital conservation buffer was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019.  Strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the final rules.  The final rules also revised the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, Total Capital, and risk-weighted assets. 
    
  The phase-in period for the final rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rules  requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule, to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's capital levels remained characterized as "well-capitalized" under the new rules. 
    
  Management continues to monitor regulatory developments and their potential impact to the Company's liquidity requirements. 
    
  Stress Testing 
    
  The Dodd-Frank Act requires federal banking agencies to issue regulations that require banks with total consolidated assets of more than $10.0 billion to conduct and publish company-run annual stress tests to assess the potential impact of different scenarios on the consolidated earnings and capital of each bank and certain related items over a nine-quarter forward-looking planning horizon, taking into account all relevant exposures and activities.  On October 9, 2012, the FRB published final rules implementing the stress testing requirements for banks, such as the Company, with total consolidated assets of more than $10.0 billion but less than $50.0 billion.  These rules set forth the timing and type of stress test activities, as well as rules governing controls, oversight and disclosure. 
    
  In March 2014, the FRB, OCC, and FDIC issued final supervisory guidance for these stress tests.  This joint final supervisory guidance discusses supervisory expectations for stress test practices, provides examples of practices that would be consistent with those expectations, and offers additional details about stress test methodologies.  It also emphasizes the importance of stress testing as an ongoing risk management practice. 
    
  We submitted our latest stress testing results to the FRB on July 29, 2016 and will disclose the results to the public (via posting to our website) in October 2016. 
    
  Deposit Insurance Fund ( DIF ) Assessment 
    
  In March 2016, the FDIC approved a final rule that imposes on banks with at least $10 billion in assets, such as the Company, a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. The surcharge became effective for the third quarter of 2016 and the FDIC estimates the surcharge will be imposed for approximately two years.  The surcharge takes effect at the same time that the regular FDIC insurance assessment rates for all banks decline under a rule adopted by the FDIC in 2011.  We estimate that the net effect of the FDIC assessment changes noted above will reduce our annual FDIC insurance expense by approximately $0.8 million.

Operational Risk 
    
  Operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including, but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, failure to adhere to compliance requirements, and the risk of cyber attacks.  We are also exposed to operational risk through our outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of our outsourcing vendors can have on our ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to our business.  The risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards, adverse business decisions or their implementation, and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity.  Operational risk is inherent in all business activities, and management of this risk is important to the achievement of Company goals and objectives.  
    
  Our Operating Risk Committee (the  ORC ) provides oversight and assesses the most significant operational risks facing the Company.  We have developed a framework that provides for a centralized operating risk management function through the ORC, supplemented by business unit responsibility for managing operational risks specific to their business units.  Our internal audit department also validates the system of internal controls through ongoing risk-based audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.   
    
  We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to improve the oversight of operational risk.  While our internal controls have been designed to minimize operational risks, there is no assurance that business disruption or operational losses will not occur.  On an ongoing basis, management reassesses operational risks, implements appropriate process changes, and invests in enhancements to our systems of internal controls.   

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Commitments, and Contractual Obligations 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We hold interests in several unconsolidated variable interest entities ( VIEs ).  These unconsolidated VIEs are primarily low-income housing partnerships and solar energy partnerships.  Variable interests are defined as contractual ownership or other interests in an entity that change with fluctuations in an entity s net asset value.  The primary beneficiary consolidates the VIE.  We have determined that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of these entities.  As a result, we do not consolidate these VIEs. 
    
  Credit Commitments and Contractual Obligations 
    
  Our credit commitments and contractual obligations have not changed materially since previously reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors 
    
  There are no material changes from the risk factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 2.       Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  The Parent s repurchases of its common stock during the   third   quarter of 2016 were as follows: 

1   
    During the   third   quarter of   2016  ,   1,223   shares were purchased for the trustee of a trust established pursuant to the Bank of Hawaii Corporation Director Deferred Compensation Plan (the  DDCP ) in satisfaction of the Company s obligations to participants under the DDCP.  The issuance of these shares were made in reliance upon the exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) by Section 4(a)(2) thereof.  Each of the trustee under the trust and the participants under the DDCP is an accredited investor, as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act.  These shares did not involve a public offering and was made without general solicitation or advertising. The shares were purchased at the closing price of the Parent s common stock on the dates of purchase. 
               2   
    The share repurchase program was first announced in July 2001.  The program has no set expiration or termination date.  The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, regulatory rules, applicable SEC rules, and various other factors.
