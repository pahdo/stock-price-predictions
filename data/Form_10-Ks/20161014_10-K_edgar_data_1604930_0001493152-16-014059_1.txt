PART
I   

Item
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.   

General
Information about Our Company   

Life
Clips, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Wyoming on March 20, 2013 as Blue Sky Media Corporation. The Company was in the
business of developing, production and distributing motion pictures. On November 3, 2015, the Company changed its name to Life
Clips, Inc.  

On
October 2, 2015, the Company completed a stock merger and exchange agreement with Klear Kapture, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of
the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 38,037,120 shares of its unregistered common stock to the shareholders
of Klear Kapture in exchange for 10,000 shares of its common stock, representing 100% of its issued and outstanding common stock.
As part of the Share Exchange, the Company purchased 107,261,000 shares of our common stock from its former executive officers
and directors for a price of $345,000. Upon the effective date of the transaction, Klear Kapture became a wholly owned subsidiary
of Life Clips.  

On
June 10, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Batterfly Energy Ltd., and all of the shareholders of Batterfly.
On July 11, 2016, the transaction closed.  

On
September 22, 2016, Life Clips, Inc. entered into a Trademark License Agreement with HP, Inc. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company
has been granted a sublicense to use, reproduce and display the HP  trademarks in various territories on HP  Branded Products,
which are products that HP  has approved for sale and distribution. The Agreement requires the Company to no longer sell the
Life Clips branded cameras or accessories to eliminate channel conflict or confusion. Therefore, the Company will focus its efforts
on creating best in class HP branded products and accessories.  

On
January 25, 2016, the Company effected a 11 for 1 forward stock split of its common stock.  

Pursuant
to our articles of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 320,000,000 shares of common stock, each having a par value of $0.001,
with each share of common stock entitled to one vote for all matters on which a shareholder vote is required or requested. We
are also authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, of which no shares have been designated to any class, and no
shares are currently issued or outstanding.  

Products   

Our
core products will be the HP  branded action cameras, 360 cameras, dash cameras and still cameras. In addition, due to our
Mobeego acquisition, we will sell Mobeego batteries.  

Batteries    

Mobeego
consists of a one-time use, non-rechargeable, battery and a special, reusable phone adapter (plug) which are is small device that
includes the charging control circuity as well as a specific male connector that matches user device s female connector.
The Company will sell Mobeego in two manners:  

(1)  
      Sets
    including a specific adapter and one or two emergency batteries   

(2)  
      Refill
    Batteries   

(3)  
      6
    pack of Batteries   

(4)  
      set
    including an adapter and one emergency battery for Action cameras such as Life Clips  action camera.   

The
Battery (Energy Unit):    

The
Energy Unit consists of a custom designed plastic casing, shaped as a small can of energy drink, hosting a powerful lithium battery.
The energy  can  has a rail used to connect it to the adapter through a rail connection. This unit is designed to
be seen as the  energy drink for the mobile devices . It is for a single use, non-rechargeable.  

Adapter    

The
adapter is a small plastic device that connects to the Battery through 2 connectors and to the mobile device through the specific
connector on user s cellphone, which could be Lightning or Deck for iPhones, micro-USB for Android devices, Blackberries
and others. The Adapter features an On/Off switch and a LED to indicate when is charging. Within the adapter, there is a smart,
electronic charging circuit on a circuit board.  

Sales   

We
plan to sell our products through retailers directly and through distributors. We are focused on building close relationships
with our retailers and distributors, educating our partners  sales forces about our products, working with them to merchandise
our products in a compelling manner in-store, as well as providing consumers with informative and convenient ecommerce experiences
at retail partner websites.  

Direct
sales    

In
addition to our international sales, we plan to sell directly to large and small retailers in the United States, directly to some
retail outlets.  

Independent
    specialty retailers.  We plan to use a network of location-based independent manufacturer representatives to sell our products
    to independent specialty retailers focused on action sports markets. Our representatives provide highly personalized service
    to these retailers, including assisting with product mix planning, channel marketing and in-store merchandising, taking orders
    and providing clinics to educate retail sales personnel about Life Clips products. We also have an internal, regionally focused
    sales team that provides a secondary level of service to both the manufacturer representatives and the independent specialty
    retailers.    

Big
    box retailers.  We plan to try and sell to large retailers with a national presence, including Amazon.com, Inc., Best Buy,
    Target Corporation and Wal-Mart, Inc. We hope our internal sales teams and our consulting relationships will allow entry into
    these stores.   

Mid-market
    retailers.  We plan to sell to retailers with a large regional or national presence, often focused on specific verticals
    such as consumer electronics, sporting goods, military, hunting and fishing and motor sports, which we refer to as our  mid-market 
    channel.    

Ecommerce
    channel.  We sell our full line of products directly to consumers around the world through our online store at klearkapture.com.
    We will drive consumers to our website through online and offline advertising, as well as marketing promotions carried out
    at tradeshows and sponsored events.   

Distribution   

The
Company s sales strategy is to distribute its HP  branded products, as well as the Mobeego products worldwide through
a series of distributors and representatives. The Company will also sell online on its website and to a selected few direct retail
accounts. However, the Company is relying on its distribution relationships to grow and maintain revenues. Our target stores are
typically chains that have established relationships with known distributors and representatives.  

Growth
Strategy   

The
Company is focused on the marketing of the HP  branded products as well as the Mobeego products in the United States as well
as internationally.  

Competition,
competitive position in the industry and methods of competition   

The
photo and video hardware and software industry, as well as the battery industry are highly competitive. The Company faces intense
competition from very large, international corporations, as well as from local and national companies. In addition, the Company
faces competition from well-known companies that have large market share.  

The
intensity of competition in the future is expected to increase and no assurance can be provided that the Company can sustain its
market position or expand its business.  

Many
of the Company s current and potential competitors are well established and have longer operating histories, significantly
greater financial and operational resources, and name recognition than the Company has. However, we believe that with our new
Mobeego product and access to distributors, it will give us the ability to sell our photo and video products using the same methodsas
the Mobeego product, and we will be able to generate sales and compete in the industry.  

Status
of any publicly announced new product or service   

None.  

Organization   

The
Company is comprised of one parent corporation, Life Clips, Inc., as well as its wholly owned subsidiary, Batterfly Energy, Ltd.  

Employees   

As
of June 30, 2016, we had four full time employees.  

Patents
and Trademarks   

The
Company currently has a United States trademark, Serial Number 86888487, for Life Clips. The Company, pursuant to the Batterfly
acquisition, now also holds a United States trademark, Serial Number 79172000 for Mobeego, a patent in China, number 201630018307.4,
as well as two patents in Israel, numbers 002743724-0001 and 002743724-0002. Any encroachment upon the company s proprietary
information, including the unauthorized use of its brand name, the use of a similar name by a competing company or a lawsuit initiated
either by our Company or against our Company for infringement upon proprietary information or improper use of a trademark, may
affect our ability to create brand name recognition, cause customer confusion and/or have a detrimental effect on its business
due to the cost of defending any potential litigation related to infringement. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. or International
Patent and Trademark Offices may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade
secrets and/or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any such litigation or adverse proceeding
could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could seriously harm our business operations and/or results of
operations.  

Government
Approval   

The
camera and battery industries, may be regulated at the federal levels, both in terms of health and safety concerns, as well as
product quality. Operation of the Company s business requires various licenses, permits and approvals. The Company currently
holds all applicable licenses and permits to operate its business, and will continue to hold all applicable permits and licenses
to continue operating its business and running its marketplace. In addition, Company will also ensure compliance with any additional
licensing requirements that are required on an ongoing basis.  

Government
and Industry Regulation   

The
Company will be subject to local and international laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations,
such as the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, and Wyoming Corporation Law. It will also be subject
to common business and tax rules and regulations pertaining to the operation of its business, such as the United States Internal
Revenue Tax Code and the Wyoming State Tax Code, as well as international tax codes and shipping tariffs. The Company will also
be subject to proprietary regulations such as United States Trademark and Patent Law as it applies to the intellectual property
of third parties. The Company believes that the effects of existing or probable governmental regulations will be additional responsibilities
of the management of the Company to ensure that the Company is in compliance with securities regulations as they apply to the
Company s products as well as ensuring that the company does not infringe on any proprietary rights of others with respect
to its products. The Company will also need to maintain accurate financial records in order to remain complaint with securities
regulations as well as any corporate tax liability it incurs.  

Research
and Development   

During
the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company spent $49,499 on the development of its products. We believe that we will continue to
incur research and development expenses, specifically related to our branded products and Mobeego products.  

Environmental
Compliance   

We
believe that we are not subject to any material costs for compliance with any environmental laws.

Market
Information   

Our
common stock is quoted on the OTCQB, under the symbol  LCLP . Our common stock was initially listed on the OTCQB on
December 15, 2015. On February 19, 2016, we effected a 11 for 1 forward stock split of our common stock.  

The
following table sets forth the range of high and low bid prices of our common stock as reported and summarized on the OTCQB, as
applicable, for the periods indicated. These prices are based on inter-dealer bid and asked prices, without markup, markdown,
commissions, or adjustments and may not represent actual transactions.  

Holders   

As
of October 14, 2016, there were 64 record holders of our common stock, and there were 70,836,334 shares of our common stock outstanding.  

Penny
Stock Rules    

The
Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in
penny stocks. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on
certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the NASDAQ system, provided that current price and volume information with
respect to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system).  

A
purchaser is purchasing penny stock which limits the ability to sell the stock. The shares offered by this prospectus constitute
penny stock under the Securities and Exchange Act. The shares will remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future. The classification
of penny stock makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes it more difficult
for a purchaser to liquidate his/her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose of selling his or
her shares in us will be subject to Rules 15g-1 through 15g-10 of the Securities and Exchange Act. Rather than creating a need
to comply with those rules, some broker-dealers will refuse to attempt to sell penny stock.  

The
penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, to deliver
a standardized risk disclosure document, which:  

a.  
      contains
    a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stock in both public offerings and secondary trading;   

b.  
      contains
    a description of the broker s or dealer s duties to the customer and of the rights and remedies available to the
    customer with respect to a violation of such duties or other requirements of the Securities Act of 1934, as amended;   

c.  
      contains
    a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including  bid  and  ask  price for the
    penny stock and the significance of the spread between the bid and ask price;   

d.  
      contains
    a toll-free telephone number for inquiries on disciplinary actions;   

e.  
      defines
    significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading penny stocks; and   

f.  
      contains
    such other information and is in such form (including language, type, size and format) as the Securities and Exchange Commission
    shall require by rule or regulation;   

The
broker-dealer also must provide, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, to the customer:  

a.  
      the
    bid and offer quotations for the penny stock;   

b.  
      the
    compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction;   

c.  
      the
    number of shares to which such bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity
    of the market for such stock; and   

d.  
      monthly
    account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer s account.   

In
addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules; the
broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive
the purchaser s written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions
involving penny stocks, and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have
the effect of reducing the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock
rules. Therefore, stockholders may have difficulty selling their securities.  

Dividend
Policy   

We
have not previously declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate declaring any dividends in the foreseeable
future. The payment of dividends on our common stock is within the discretion of our board of directors. We intend to retain any
earnings for use in our operations and the expansion of our business. Payment of dividends in the future will depend on our future
earnings, future capital needs and our operating and financial condition, among other factors that our board of directors may
deem relevant. We are not under any contractual restriction as to our present or future ability to pay dividends.

Overview   

Life
Clips, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of Wyoming on March 20, 2013 as Blue Sky Media Corporation. The Company was in the
business of developing, production and distributing motion pictures. On November 3, 2015, the Company changed its name to Life
Clips, Inc.  

On
October 2, 2015, the Company completed a stock merger and exchange agreement with Klear Kapture, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of
the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 38,037,120 shares of its unregistered common stock to the shareholders
of Klear Kapture in exchange for 10,000 shares of its common stock, representing 100% of its issued and outstanding common stock.
As part of the Share Exchange, the Company purchased 107,261,000 shares of our common stock from its former executive officers
and directors for a price of $345,000. Upon the effective date of the transaction, Klear Kapture became a wholly owned subsidiary
of Life Clips.  

On
June 10, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Batterfly Energy Ltd., and all of the shareholders of Batterfly.
On July 11, 2016, the transaction closed.  

On
September 22, 2016, Life Clips, Inc. entered into a Trademark License Agreement with HP, Inc. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company
has been granted a sublicense to use, reproduce and display the HP  trademarks in various territories on HP  Branded Products,
which are products that HP  has approved for sale and distribution.   

On
January 25, 2016, the Company effected a 11 for 1 forward stock split of its common stock.  

Pursuant
to our articles of incorporation, we are authorized to issue 320,000,000 shares of common stock, each having a par value of $0.001,
with each share of common stock entitled to one vote for all matters on which a shareholder vote is required or requested. We
are also authorized to issue 20,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, of which no shares have been designated to any class, and no
shares are currently issued or outstanding.  

Limited
Operating History; Need for Additional Capital   

There
is little historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. To date, we have generated
minimal revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject
to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns
due to increases in the cost of services. To become profitable and competitive, we must receive additional capital. We have no
assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available we may be unable to continue operations.

Plan
of Operations   

We
plan to manufacture and sell HP  branded products pursuant to our license agreement with HP , as well as the newly acquired
Mobeego products internationally using the current Mobeego distributors.  

How
We Generate Revenue   

We
expect to recognize revenues in accordance with the guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Staff
Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 104  Revenue Recognition .  

Under
SAB 104, four conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists,
(ii) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably
assured.  

General
and administrative expenses consisted of professional service fees, and other general and administrative overhead costs. Expenses
are recognized when incurred.  

Depending
on the extent of our future growth, we may experience significant strain on our management, personnel, and information systems.
We will need to implement and improve operational, financial, and management information systems. In addition, we are implementing
new information systems that will provide better record-keeping, customer service and billing. However, there can be no assurance
that our management resources or information systems will be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business, and the failure
to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  

Results
of Operations   

For
the Years ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015    

The
Company generated $534 in revenue for the year ended June 30, 2016, which compares with revenue of $2,783 for the year ended June
30, 2015. Our revenues decreased during the year ended June 30, 2016 due to a decrease in the sales of our products, which were
limited to only online sales.  

Cost
of Goods Sold for the year ended June 30, 2016 were $71,903, which compares with Cost of Goods Sold of $1,513 for the year ended
June 30, 2015. The increase in our cost of goods sold was related to expenses for the development of our products.  

Operating
expenses, which consisted of finance costs, payroll expenses, product development expenses, professional fees, consulting fees,
marketing expenses, software fees and support, travel and general and administrative expenses, for the year ended June 30, 2016,
were $2,182,543. This compares with operating expenses for the year ended June 30, 2015 of $714,204. The increase in operating
expenses for the year ended June 30, 2016 is related to a increases in all of our operating expenses, with the most notable increases
being related to payroll, product development, professional fees and software fees and support costs,  

As
a result of the foregoing, we had a net loss of $19,713,550 for the year ended June 30, 2016. This compares with a net loss for
the year ended June 30, 2015 of $737,805. The increase in our net loss is primarily due to an increase in our expenses for the
year ended June 30, 2016 coupled with a decrease in our gross profit.  

In
its audited financial statements as of June 30, 2016, the Company was issued an opinion by its auditors that raised substantial
doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern based on the Company s current financial position. Our ability to
achieve and maintain profitability and positive cash flow is dependent upon our ability to successfully develop and market our
products and our ability to generate revenues.  

The
Company anticipates introducing its new HP branded products in the first quarter of 2016. The new products are two compact action
cameras targeted to retail audiences. The new cameras will have what we believe are unique features such as IR for night recording,
live streaming, and two cameras that can film the same event simultaneously to get two perspectives of that event. The Company
believes that multiple views and live streaming would be positive features of the camera based on trends in the Internet and video
segments. The Company is focusing its efforts on these products for the success of continued operations. Non-acceptance by retailers
would have a significant impact on continuing operations.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

As
of June 30, 2016 we had cash or cash equivalents of $469,233. As of June 30, 2015 we had cash or cash equivalents of $2,644.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $895,989 for the year ended June 30, 2016. This compares to net cash used in operating activities
of $132,361 for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in our net cash used in operating activities for the year ended June
30, 2016 was primarily due to a substantial increase in our net loss from $737,805 to $19,713,550.  

Cash
flows used in investing activities was $240,000 for the year ended June 30, 2016, as compared to $0 for the year ended June 30,
2015. The increase in our cash used in investing activities was due to our acquisition of Batterfly.  

Cash
flows provided by financing activities was $1,602,578 for the year ended June 30, 2016, which compares to cash flows provided
by financing activities of $135,000 for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in our cash flows provided by financing activities
for the year ended June 30, 2016 was due to an increase in proceeds from convertible notes.  

We
have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights
or technologies or any other material capital expenditures. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments
in products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions
and/or investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any
such acquisitions and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
Due to the ongoing global economic crisis, we believe it may be difficult to obtain additional financing if needed. Even if we
are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or
cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.

January 19, 2015, the Company received $50,000 cash from equity fund raising.

Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 38,037,120 shares of its unregistered common

Fiscal
year end   

Our

Going
Concern   

Our
independent auditors have added an explanatory paragraph to their audit opinion issued in connection with our financial statements.
We had net losses of $19,713,550 and $737,805 for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  

We
believe that the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity
for us to continue as a going concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in its ability
to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon our ability to further implement our business plan and generate revenues.  

The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
Commission has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of
our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often
as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified
the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant
to understanding our results.  

The
following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting us.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of these financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses
during the reported periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the financial
statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others: property and equipment, foreign
currency transactions and translations, and common stock valuation. The current economic environment has increased the degree
of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.  

Income
Taxes   

We
account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach. This process involves calculating the temporary and permanent
differences between the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for
income tax purposes. The temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which would be recorded on our balance
sheets in accordance with ASC 740, which established financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes.
We must assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we
believe that recovery is not likely, we must establish a valuation allowance. Changes in our valuation allowance in a period are
recorded through the income tax provision on the statement of operations.  

From
the date of our inception we adopted ASC 740-10-30. ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized
in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement
disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return. Under ASC 740-10, the impact of an uncertain income
tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon
audit by the relevant taxing authority. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood
of being sustained. Additionally, ASC 740-10 provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure and transition. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740-10, we recognized no material adjustment
in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits.  

Non-Cash
Equity Transactions   

Shares
of equity instruments issued for non-cash consideration are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received based on
the market value of services to be rendered, or at the value of the stock given, considered in reference to contemporaneous cash
sale of stock.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

We
apply the provisions of accounting guidance, FASB Topic ASC 825 that requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial
instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate
fair value, and defines fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties. As of March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of accounts payable approximated
carrying value due to the short maturity of the instruments, quoted market prices or interest rates which fluctuate with market
rates.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-10,  Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including
an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.  This ASU removes the definition of a development
stage entity from the ASC, thereby removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting
entities from GAAP. In addition, the ASU eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date
information in the statements of operations, cash flows, and stockholders  equity, (2) label the financial statements as
those of a development stage entity, (3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged,
and (4) disclose in the first year in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been
in the development stage. In addition, ASU 2014-10 requires an entity that has not commenced principal operations to provide disclosures
about the risks and uncertainties related to the activities in which the entity is currently engaged and an understanding of what
those activities are being directed toward. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014,
and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. We have elected to adopt this ASU and its adoption resulted in the removal
of previously required development stage disclosures. Adoption of this ASU did not impact our financial position, operations or
cash flows.  

Future
Contractual Obligations and Commitment   

We
incur contractual obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Contractual
obligations include future cash payments required under existing contracts, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations
may result from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related operating
activities.  

As
of June 30, 2016, we have no future contractual obligations or commitments, other than our HP  License Agreement.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

As
of March 31, 2016, we have not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement with an entity unconsolidated
under which it has:  

a
    retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit;   

liquidity
    or market risk support to such entity for such assets;   

an
    obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument; or   

an
    obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held
    by, and material to us, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to or engages
    in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.   

Inflation   

We
do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations.

The
Board of Directors and Shareholders of  

  Life

We
have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Life Clips, Inc. (the  Company ) as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on these financial statements based on our audits.  

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of their internal
control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for
designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
Company as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations, changes in stockholders  (deficit) and cash flows
for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
in Note 3 to the financial statements, the Company has a net loss and negative cash flows from operations, which raises substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans regarding those matters also are described in
Note 3. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

As
discussed in Note 15 to the financial statements, the 2015 financial statements have been restated to correct a misstatement.

NOTE
1. ORGANIZATION AND OPERATIONS   

Business
and basis of presentation    Life Clips, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of Wyoming
on March 20, 2013 as Blue Sky Media Corporation. On November 3, 2015, the Company changed its name to Life Clips, Inc. to more
accurately reflect its business after a merger set forth below.  

On
October 2, 2015, the Company completed a stock merger and exchange agreement with Klear Kapture, Inc. Pursuant to the terms of
the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 38,037,120 shares of its unregistered common stock to the shareholders
of Klear Kapture in exchange for 10,000 shares of its common stock, representing 100% of its issued and outstanding common stock.
As part of the Share Exchange, the Company purchased 107,261,000 shares of our common stock from its former executive officers
and directors for a price of $345,000. Upon the effective date of the transaction, Klear Kapture became a wholly owned subsidiary
of Life Clips.  

On
June 10, 2016, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Batterfly Energy Ltd., and all of the shareholders of Batterfly.
On July 11, 2016, the transaction closed.  

On
September 22, 2016, Life Clips, Inc. entered into a Trademark License Agreement with HP, Inc. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company
has been granted a sublicense to use, reproduce and display the HP  trademarks in various territories on HP  Branded Products,
which are products that HP  has approved for sale and distribution. Due to the license agreement, the Company no longer manufactures
and sells its own branded products.   

On
January 25, 2016, the Company effected a 11 for 1 forward stock split of its common stock.  

NOTE
2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Use
of estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.  

Cash
and cash equivalents    For financial statement presentation purposes, the Company considers all short term investments
with a maturity date of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  

Income
Tax    The Company accounts for income taxes under ASC 740  Income Taxes  which codified SFAS 109,  Accounting
for Income Taxes.  under the asset and liability method of ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC
740, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period the enactment
occurs. A valuation allowance is provided for certain deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the Company will
not realize tax assets through future operations.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Per Share    The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260
 Earnings Per Share  which codified SFAS No. 128.  Earnings per Share.  ASC 260 requires presentation
of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net
income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period. If applicable, diluted earnings per share assume the conversion, exercise or issuance of all common stock instruments
such as options, warrants and convertible securities, unless the effect is to reduce a loss or increase earnings per share. Diluted
EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.  

Intangible
Asset    The Company is developing software. The development cost through June 30, 2016 has totaled $70,450. The software
has an infinite useful life and will be tested annually for impairment.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance
on fair value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability,
as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes
a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation
techniques, are assigned a hierarchical level.  

The
following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:  

Level
    1   Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level
    2   Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for
    similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities;
    or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   

Level
    3   Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company s assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine
    fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.   

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, other current assets,
accounts payable   accrued expenses, certain notes payable and notes payable   related party, approximate their fair
values because of the short maturity of these instruments.  

The
Company accounts for its derivative liabilities, at fair value, on a recurring basis under level 3. See Note 8.  

Embedded
Conversion Features   

The
Company evaluates embedded conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging  to
determine whether the embedded conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative
at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment
under ASC 815, the instrument is evaluated under ASC 470-20  Debt with Conversion and Other Options  for consideration
of any beneficial conversion feature.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments   

The
Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates
all of its financial instruments, including stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain
features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the
derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the
fair value reported as charges or credits to income.  

For
option-based simple derivative financial instruments, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to value the derivative
instruments at inception and subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such
instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.  

Debt
Issue Costs and Debt Discount   

The
Company may record debt issue costs and/or debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of debt. These
costs may be paid in the form of cash, or equity (such as warrants). These costs are amortized to interest expense over the life
of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs, a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.  

Stock
based compensation    ASC 718  Compensation Stock Compensation  codified SFAS No. 123 prescribes accounting
and reporting standards for all stock based compensation plans payments award to employees, including employee stock options,
restricted stock, employee stock purchase plans and stock appreciation rights, which may be classified as either equity or liabilities.
The Company should determine if a present obligation to settle the share based payment transaction in cash or other assets exists.
A present obligation to settle in cash or other assets exists if: (a) the option to settle by issuing equity instruments lacks
commercial substance or (b) the present obligation is implied because of an entity s past practices or stated policies.
If a present obligation exists, the transaction should be recognized as a liability  otherwise, the transaction should be
recognized as equity.  

The
Company accounts for stock based compensation issued to nonemployees and consultants in accordance with the provisions of ASC
50550  Equity Based Payments to NonEmployees  which codified SFAS 123 and the Emerging Issues Task Force consensus
in Issue No. 9618,  Accounting for Equity Instruments that are Issued to Other Than Employees for Acquiring or in Conjunction
with Selling, Goods or Services . Measurement of share based payment transactions with nonemployees shall be based on the
fair value of whichever is more reliably measurable: (a) the goods or services received  or (b) the equity instruments issued.
The fair value of the share based payment transaction should be determined at the earlier of performance commitment date or performance
completion date.  

Common
Stock    On December 15, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to authorize 320,000,000 shares of common stock,
to change the par value to $0.001 and to execute a 11:1 forward stock split. All common stock and per share data for the period
presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted to give effect to the forward stock split.  

Preferred
Stock    On December 15, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to authorize 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock,
par value $0.001.  

Recognition
of Revenues    The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104,  Revenue Recognition
in Financial Statements . This statement established that revenue can be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists, the services have been delivered, all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied, the fee is fixed or determinable
and collection is reasonably assured.  

Subsequent
Events    The Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the
disclosure of subsequent events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the date when the financial statements are
issued.  

Pursuant
to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its financial statements issued
when they are widely distributed to users, such as through filing them on EDGAR.  

Recent
Pronouncements     

In
January 2015, FASB issued Update No. 2015-01  Income Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20):
Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items.  This Update eliminates from GAAP
the concept of extraordinary items. It is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments
retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance
is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The effective date is the same for both public business entities
and all other entities. We do not expect this ASU to have a material impact on our financial statements.  

The
Company reviewed all recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA,
and the SEC and they did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company s present or future
financial statements.  

NOTE
3. UNCERTAINTY OF ABILITY TO CONTINUE AS A GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements,
the Company has minimal revenues, net accumulated losses since inception and a shareholders  deficit of $(20,096,452). These
factors raise doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern
is dependent on management funding operating costs and the successful production and sales release of the Life Clips camera. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
4. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

At
June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, a major shareholder owed the Company $-0- and $2,713, respectively.  

NOTE
5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS   

The
Company is developing software. The development cost for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 are $646,980 and 44,598, respectively.
The software have been written off during the annually impairment test.  

NOTE
6. NOTES PAYABLE   

At
June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 the Company had notes payable in the amount of $0 and $85,000, respectively.  

NOTE
7. CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND WARRANTS    

The
Company has recorded derivative liabilities associated with convertible debt instruments and warrants, as more fully discussed
at Note 8.  

(A)
Convertible Debt   

On
October 2, 2015, the Company completed an offering of its 3.85% Convertible Promissory Notes (the  3.85% Notes ) in
the aggregate principal amount of $617,578 and on December 7, 2015 the Company completed an offering of its 10% Convertible Promissory
Notes (the  10% Notes ) in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000 (the  10% Notes , and together with
the 3.85% Notes, each a  Note  and collectively, the  Notes ), as applicable, with certain  accredited
investors  (the  Investors ), as defined under Regulation D, Rule 501 of the Securities Act. The entire aggregate
principal amount of the Notes of $867,578 was outstanding as of June 30, 2016, such amount being exclusive of securities converted
into the Notes separate from the offering of the Notes. Pursuant to the offering of the Notes, the Company received $617,578 and
$250,000 in net proceeds on October 2, 2015 and December 7, 2015, respectively.  

In
addition to the terms customarily included in such instruments, the Notes began accruing interest on the date that each Investor
submitted the principal balance of such Investor s Note, with the interest thereon becoming due and payable on the two-year
anniversary of said date. Upon a default of the Notes, the interest rate will increase to 18%. The principal balance of each Note
and all unpaid interest will become due and payable twenty-four (24) months after the date of issuance. The Notes may be prepaid
with or without a penalty depending on the date of the prepayment. The principal and interest under the 3.85% Notes are converted
at $ $0.026. The principal and interest under the 10% Notes are convertible into shares of the Company s common stock at
75% times the Volume Weighted Average Price for a 5 days period prior to the conversion date as quoted on the OTC market and pursuant
to the terms of a Security Purchase Agreement, dated as of October 2, 2015 and December 7, 2015, as applicable, by and between
the Company and each Investor.  

In
connection with the Notes Offering, the Company entered into Registration Rights Agreements, each dated as of October 2, 2015
and December 7, 2015 and each by and between us and each of the Investors.  

The
company entered into convertible notes with seven third party accredited investors from December 2015 to June 2016. In addition
to the terms customarily included in such instruments, the Notes began accruing interest on the date that each Investor submitted
the principal balance of such Investor s Note, with the interest thereon becoming due and payable on terms specified in
said date (see below). Interest rates range from 5% to 10% and are due at various dates from August 2016 to March 2018. These
notes are convertible at any time by the investor, prior to the note principal and interest being repaid at rates ranging from
$0.375 to $0.44 per share, subject to change due to a ratchet feature contained in most of the notes.  

(B)
Terms   of Debt   

The
debt carries interest between 3.85% and 10%, and is due in October 2017 and March 2018.  

All
convertible debt in connection with the Notes Offering are convertible at $0.026 and $0.44/share (on June 30, 2016), however,
the Notes include a  ratchet feature , which allows for a lower offering price based on market prices.  

(C)
Future Commitments   

At
June 30, 2016, the Company has outstanding convertible debt of $2,032,578 which is payable within the next twenty-one months.  

(D)
Warrants   

The
Company issued four warrants dated from February to May 2016. Two of the warrants are related to consulting agreements and two
are related to convertible note holders. All warrants issued during the year ended December 31, 2016 were accounted for as derivative
liabilities, as the warrants were not held on reserve at and therefore tainted. See Note 8. No warrants were issued exercised
during the year ended June, 2016. The details are:  

NOTE
8. DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES   

The
Company identified conversion features embedded within convertible debt and warrants issued in the year ended June 30, 2016. The
Company has determined that the features associated with the embedded conversion option, in the form a ratchet provision, should
be accounted for at fair value, as a derivative liability, as the Company cannot determine if a sufficient number of shares would
be available to settle all potential future conversion and warrant transactions.  

As
a result of the application of ASC No. 815, the fair value of the ratchet feature related to convertible debt and warrants is
summarized as follow:  

The
fair value at the commitment and re-measurement dates for the Company s derivative liabilities were based upon the following
management assumptions as June 30, 2016:  

NOTE
9. CONVERTIBLE DEBT - NET   

The
Company recorded the debt discount to the extent of the gross proceeds raised, and expensed immediately the remaining fair value
of the derivative liability, as it exceeded the gross proceeds of the note.  

The
Company recorded debt discount of $2,030,783 and $46,129 for the year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Accumulated
amortization of debt discount amounted to $441,270 and $0 for the year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company recorded amortization
expense of the debt issuance cost of $46,129 and $0 for the year ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

NOTE
11. EQUITY   

On
October 2, 2015 (the  Effective Date ) the Company entered into and closed on a merger and exchange agreement (the
 Share Exchange Agreement ) with Klear Kapture in an effort to expand its current line of business. Klear Kapture
has developed a body camera and an auditable software solution suitable for use by law enforcement that it intends to produce,
market and sell. Following the closing of the Share Exchange Agreement, we intend to continue Klear Kapture s historical
business and proposed business and have entered into a services agreement with our former executive officers and directors to
operate our film marketing, distribution and production video and APP development businesses pursuant to the terms of a Services
Agreement dated October 2, 2015 (the  Services Agreement ). However, we no longer intend to operate the pre-transaction
business of the Company.  

Pursuant
to a consulting agreement with a non-related third party, we issued 3,190,000 shares on October 2, 2015 for a price of approximately
$0.00318 per share (an aggregate of $10,150), which was recorded as consulting services.  

On
December 15, 2015, the Company filed Articles of Amendment to authorize 320,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, to authorize 20,000,000 share of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, and to execute a 11:1 forward stock split.
All common stock and per share date for the period presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to give effect
to the forward stock split.  

Pursuant
to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, as of the Effective Date, we agreed to issue 38,037,120 shares of our unregistered
common stock to the shareholders of Klear Kapture in exchange for 10,000 shares of its common stock, representing 100% of its
issued and outstanding common stock in the Share Exchange. As part of the Share Exchange, we purchased 107,261,000 shares of our
common stock from our former executive officers and directors for a price of approximately $ 0.00318 per share (an aggregate of
$345,000). Upon the Effective Date, Klear Kapture became a wholly owned subsidiary of our company and our pro-forma shares of
common stock outstanding giving effect to the repurchase of shares from our former executive officers and directors is 53,343,620.
Robert Gruder who was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer and a Director in connection with the Share Exchange received 30,296,563
shares of our common stock in exchange for 7,965 shares of Klear Kapture s common stock he previously owned. Mr. Gruder s
ownership of our common stock represents approximately 56.8% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock.  

Other
than as part of the Share Exchange, there were no stock issuances for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2016.  

On
April 20, 2016, the company adopted the Life Clips, Inc. 2016 Stock and Incentive Plan under which the Company may issue nonqualified
stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock grants and units, performance units and awards
of cash. A maximum of 20,000,000 shares of common stock may be issued under the plan, representing in excess of 35% of the number
of the Company s currently outstanding shares. Awards under the plan will be made at the discretion of the Board of Directors,
although no awards have been made to date. Accordingly, the Company cannot currently determine the amount of awards that will
be made under the plan.  

The
Company has issued four warrants dated from February to May 2016. Two of the warrants are related to consulting agreements and
two are related to convertible note holders. The details are:  

NOTE
16. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

The
Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent
events. The company will evaluate subsequent events through the date of the issuance of the financial statements.  

On
July , 2016, Life Clips, Inc. (the   Company  ) completed the Stock Purchase Agreement (the   Purchase
Agreement  ) with Batterfly Energy Ltd., an Israel-based corporation that develops and distributes a single-use, cordless
battery for use with cellular phones and other mobile devices (  Batterfly  ), and all of the shareholders of
Batterfly (the   Batterfly Shareholders  ). Under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company will acquire
all of the outstanding capital stock of Batterfly (the   Acquisition  ) in exchange for consideration in the
form of:  

(i)  
      $1,000,000
    in cash, of which $450,000 will be payable at closing, with the remainder paid in installments on the dates that are 12 months
    and 16 months after the closing;   

(ii)  
      a
    promissory note and stock pledge agreement to be issued by the Company payable to the Batterfly Shareholders in the amount
    of $500,000 (the   Promissory Note  );   

(iii)  
      10,000,000
    shares of the Company s common stock, of which 5,000,000 will be issued to the Batterfly Shareholders at closing, with
    part of the remainder issued on the one-year anniversary of the closing and the other part of the remainder issued on the
    date that the Company has sold an aggregate of 1,000,000 units of Batterfly s products after closing; and   

(iv)  
      quarterly
    payments of cash, up to an aggregate amount of $2,000,000, based on the number of Batterfly s products sold by the Company
    after the closing date of the Acquisition.    

The
shares of the Company s common stock to be issued at closing and at the specified periods thereafter will be offered and
sold in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
  Securities Act  ), and Regulation S promulgated under the Securities Act. To that effect, each Batterfly Shareholder
has represented to the Company in the Purchase Agreement that he or she is a not a  U.S. Person  (as defined by Regulation
S), is not acquiring the Company s shares for the account or benefit of a U.S. Person and will only resell the shares under
Regulation S, an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or an available exemption from registration under the
Securities Act.  

The
Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties regarding the Batterfly Shareholders, Batterfly and the Company,
and Batterfly has agreed to customary covenants including, among others, covenants relating to (i) the conduct of Batterfly s
business in the ordinary course during the interim period between the execution of the Purchase Agreement and the consummation
of the Acquisition and (ii) Batterfly s non-solicitation obligations relating to alternative business combination transactions.
The closing of the Acquisition, which the Company expects to occur in the next 20 days, is subject to various customary closing
conditions, including, without limitation, the representations and warranties of each party being true and correct as of the closing
date, consulting agreements between the Company and the two principal shareholders of Batterfly being executed and delivered,
the absence of any governmental orders prohibiting the transaction and the approval of the tax treatment for the Acquisition being

NOTE
13. Income Tax Provision   

Income taxes are provided for the tax
effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due. Deferred taxes relate to
differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting which will be either taxable
or deductible when the assets or liabilities are recovered or settled. 

At June 30, 2016, the Company has a net operating
loss carry-forward of approximately $20,454,450 available to offset future taxable income expiring through 2035. Utilization of
future net operating losses may be limited due to potential ownership changes under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

In assessing the realization of deferred tax
assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will
not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income
during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred
income tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based on consideration
of these items, management has determined that enough uncertainty exists relative to the realization of the deferred income tax
asset balances to warrant the application of a full valuation allowance as of June 30, 2016. 

The effects of temporary differences that gave rise to significant portions of deferred tax assets at June
30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 are approximately as follows: 

There was no income tax expense for the years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 due to the Company s net
losses 

Note
14. Deposits   

In
June 2016, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with Batterfly as described in Note 14. As part of the agreement,
the Company paid a security deposit of $240,000.  

ITEM
9. DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.   

We
did not have any disagreements on accounting and financial disclosures with our present accounting firm during the reporting period.  

ITEM
9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

The
Company s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act.
The Company s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the
reports it files or submits under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and that such
information is communicated to management and the Company s board of directors to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure.  

Based
on this evaluation, it has been concluded that the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective
since the following material weaknesses exist:  

Since
    inception our chief executive officer also functions as our chief financial officer. As a result, our officers may not be
    able to identify errors and irregularities in the financial statements and reports. There exists a lack of multiple levels
    of supervision and review.   

We
    were unable to maintain full segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel
    in the finance function. This control deficiency could result in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or
    detected by a segregation of duties.   

Documentation
    of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete.   

To
the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources, as financial resources become available we intend to take measures
to cure the aforementioned weaknesses, including, but not limited to, the following:  

Increasing
    the capacity of our qualified financial personnel to ensure that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across
    the organization and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures.   

Inherent
Limitations Over Internal Controls   

Internal
control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its
inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and circumvention by collusion or overriding of controls. Accordingly,
even an effective internal control system may not prevent or detect material misstatements on a timely basis. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes
in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.   

We
have made no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the last year that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Attestation
Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm.   

This
annual report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control
over financial reporting. Management s report was not subject to attestation by our independent registered public accounting
firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management s report in this annual report on
Form 10-K.

1)
I have reviewed this Annual report of Life Clips, Inc. on Form 10-K;  

2)
Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary

4)
I am responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the
Registrant and have;  

(a)  
      Designed
    such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
    to ensure the material information relating to the Registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us
    by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;   

(b)  
      Designed
    such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under
    our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
    statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;   

(c)  
      Evaluated
    the effectiveness of the Registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
    about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
    on such evaluation.

      Disclosed
    in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s
    most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
    affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting;
    and   

5)
I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the Registrant s
auditors and the audit committee of the Registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions):  

(a)  
      All
    significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
    are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Registrant s ability to record, process summarize and report financial
    information; and   

(b)  
      Any
    fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Registrant s
    internal controls over financial reporting.
