Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Unaudited)

Note 1   History and organization of the company

The Company was originally organized on September 11, 2006 (Date of Inception) under the laws of the State of Nevada, as The Engraving Masters, Inc.  The Company was authorized to issue up to 100,000,000 shares of its common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock, each with a par value of $0.001 per share.

On March 14, 2014, the Company acquired Blue Line Protection Group, Inc., a Colorado corporation formed in February 2014 ("Blue Line Colorado"), as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.  Blue Line Colorado provides protection, compliance and financial services to the lawful cannabis industry.

On May 2, 2014, the Company changed its name from The Engraving Masters, Inc. to Blue Line Protection Group, Inc. ("BLPG")

On May 6, 2014, the Company effected a forward stock split and a pro-rata increase in its authorized common stock on a basis of 14-to-1, whereby each shareholder received 14 newly issued shares of common stock for each 1 share held.  Additionally, the authorized capital of the Company concurrently increased to 1,400,000,000 shares of common stock.  All references to share and per share amounts in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto have been retroactively restated to reflect the forward stock split.

The Company provides armed protection, logistics, and compliance services for businesses engaged in the legal cannabis industry.  The Company offers asset logistic services, such as armored transportation service; security services, including shipment protection, money escorts, security monitoring, asset vaulting, VIP and dignitary protection, financial services, such as handling transportation and storage of currency; training; and compliance services.

Note 2   Basis of presentation

Interim financial statements

The unaudited interim financial statements included herein, presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles and stated in US dollars, have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.

These statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein.  It is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto included in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K.  The Company follows the same accounting policies in the preparation of interim reports.

Results of operations for the interim periods are not indicative of annual results.

Reclassification

Certain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Concentrations

The Company had 5 major customers which generated approximately 63% (23%, 15%, 9%, 9% and 7%) of total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

The Company had 5 major customers which generated approximately 59% (16%, 15%, 11%, 9% and 8%) of total revenue in the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Note 3   Going concern

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.  As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has a net loss of $(1,376,979) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, accumulated deficit of $(5,912,808) and had a working capital deficit of $(2,246,892) as of September 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources.  The Company is significantly dependent upon its ability, and will continue to attempt, to secure additional equity and/or debt financing.    There are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.

The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.

Note 9   Stockholders' equity

The Company was originally authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock and 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock.  On May 6, 2014, the Company effected a forward stock split and a pro-rata increase in its authorized common stock on a basis of 14-to-1, whereby each shareholder received 14 newly issued shares of common stock for each 1 share held.  Additionally, the number of authorized shares increased to 1,400,000,000 shares of common stock.  All references to share and per share amounts in the consolidated financial statements and these notes thereto have been retroactively restated to reflect the forward stock split.

On May 3, 2016, the Company entered into, an agreement with Hypur Ventures, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the "Hypur Ventures")   which is a related party pursuant to which the Company sold to Hypur Ventures, in a private placement, 10,000,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock and 5,000,000 common stock warrants with a five year term and an exercise price of $0.10, at a purchase price of $0.05 per share for gross proceeds of $500,000.  The shares of Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock.  The Preferred Stock shall have such other rights, preferences and privileges to be set forth in a certificate of designation to be filed with the Secretary of State. The Company evaluated the convertible preferred stock under FASB ASC 470-20-30 and determined it contained a beneficial conversion feature. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature was determined to be $114,229. The beneficial conversion feature was fully amortized and recorded as a deemed dividend.

Between July and August of 2016 Hypur Ventures purchased an additional 10,000,000 shares of the Company's preferred stock and 5,000,000 common stock warrants with a five year term and an exercise price of $0.10, at a purchase price of $0.05 per share for net proceeds of $445,000, net of legal fees of $55,000.  The shares of Preferred Stock are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock.  The Preferred Stock shall have such other rights, preferences and privileges to be set forth in a certificate of designation to be filed with the Secretary of State. The Company evaluated the convertible preferred stock under FASB ASC 470-20-30 and determined it does not contain a beneficial conversion feature. The intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature was determined to be $0.The Preferred Stock is convertible at any time at the election of Hypur Ventures.  The Preferred Stock shall automatically convert to Common Stock if the closing price of the Company's Common Stock equals or exceeds $.50 per share over any consecutive twenty day trading period.  The Preferred Stock terms include a one-time purchase price preference. No preferential dividends apply to the Preferred Stock.  The Preferred Stock attributes include weighted average anti-dilution protection, rights to appoint one director, pre-emptive rights to purchase future offerings of securities by the Company, demand and piggy-back registration rights.

Note 10   Options

All stock options have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the common stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option award is estimated using a Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model.  The Company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock and does not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, the Company uses an expected dividend yield of zero in the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model.  Volatility is an estimate based on the calculated historical volatility of similar entities in industry, in size and in financial leverage, whose share prices are publicly available. The expected life of awards granted represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding. The Company has no historical experience with which to establish a basis for determining an expected life of these awards. Therefore, the Company only gave consideration to the contractual terms and did not consider the vesting schedules, exercise patterns and pre-vesting and post-vesting forfeitures significant to the expected life of the option award.  The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model on the implied yield currently available on U.S. Treasury issues with an equivalent remaining term equal to the expected life of the award.

The following is a summary of the Company's stock option activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

The following tables summarize information about stock options outstanding and exercisable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Total stock-based compensation expense in connection with options and modified awards recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $57,006 and $250,528, respectively.

Note 11   Subsequent Events

ITEM 2     MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Report.

We were originally incorporated in Nevada on September 11, 2006, under the name The Engraving Masters, Inc. (the "Company").  

On May 2, 2014, we changed our name to Blue Line Protection Group, Inc.

On May 6, 2014, our directors approved a 14-for-1 forward stock split.  In connection with the stock split, our authorized capital increased to 1,400,000,000 shares of common stock.  All references to share and per share amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been retroactively restated to reflect the forward stock split.

We provide armed protection and transportation, banking, compliance and training services for businesses engaged in the legal cannabis industry.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 approximately 97% of our revenue was derived from armed protection and transportation services.  The remaining 3% of our revenue was derived from other services. 

It is estimated that the total market for marijuana, legal or otherwise, will exceed the economic value of corn and wheat combined.  Marijuana is widely considered the largest cash crop in the United States.  Businesses have been positioning themselves for years, each trying to establish a leadership position in the legal marijuana industry.  

Cultivation facilities are the producers of legal cannabis that eventually make its way to consumers.  Growers' operations typically span a large geographic footprint, making them susceptible to theft, as are shipments from the growers to testing laboratories or to retail dispensaries.  Additionally, due to current federal marijuana legislation and banking environment, growers are finding it increasingly difficult to secure their cash, purchase equipment and obtain financing for expansion.

Dispensaries are the retail face of the legal cannabis industry.  All legal sales of cannabis products are transacted through dispensaries that are state-licensed.  To maintain their licenses, dispensaries must comply with a variety of state-mandated reporting requirements, including reporting every gram of cannabis passing in and out of the store.  Dispensaries also face financing and banking challenges similar to those that growers encounter.

In March 2015, our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary, BLPG, Inc., was granted licenses to provide our services in Nevada.

We do not grow, test or sell marijuana.

Armed Protection and Transportation

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, most of our revenue was derived from armed protection and transportation services.  

Fundamental to the legal cannabis industry is the protection of product and cash throughout the distribution channel.  Growers ship product from their cultivation facilities to independent laboratories where it is tested for compliance with state-mandated parameters.  From the labs, the product is then delivered to the retail dispensaries, where it is sold to the public.

13 

Due to the current banking and regulatory environments, payments between each step in the distribution network are made in cash: from the customer back to the grower.  Therefore, these businesses are forced into having to transport bags of money between growers and dispensaries and their own vaults or storage facilities.

The risk of theft of cash and product is present at every stage, even when they are not in transit.  Accordingly, all cannabis businesses require security measures to prevent theft, mitigate risk to employees and maintain regulatory compliance.

We began our security and protection operations in Colorado in February 2014.  Since then, we have become the largest legal cannabis protection services company in the state.  We offer a fully integrated approach to managing the movement of cannabis and cash from growers through dispensaries via armed and armored transport, money processing, vaulting and related credit.  Money processing services generally include counting, sorting and wrapping currency.

We currently supply guards, protection and armed and armored transportation to approximately 60% of all the licensees in Colorado. We are focused on encompassing all compliance needs on behalf of our clients, as mandated by the State and Federal authorities for the protection, transport and sale of cannabis.

We also offer security monitoring, asset vaulting, and VIP and dignitary protection.

Capital Resources and Liquidity

Our material sources and  uses  of cash during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were:

14 

As of September 30, 2016 we did not have any material capital commitments.

Other than as disclosed above, we do not anticipate any material   capital requirements for the twelve months ending September 30, 2017.

Other than as disclosed above, we do not know of any:

trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonable likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way; or

any significant changes in our expected sources and uses of cash.

We do not have any commitments or arrangements from any person to provide us with any equity capital.

During the next twelve months, we anticipate that we will incur approximately $1,900,000 of general and administrative expenses in order to execute our current business plan. We also plan to incur significant sales, marketing, research and development expenses during the next 12 months. We must obtain additional financing to continue our operations. We may not be able to obtain additional funding on terms that are favorable to us or at all. We may not be able to obtain sufficient funding to continue our operations, or if we do receive funding, to generate adequate revenues in the future or to operate profitably in the future. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have not entered into any off-balance sheet arrangements.

Critical Accounting Policies

Management considers the following policies critical because they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results, and they require management to make judgments and estimates about inherently uncertain matters.

Accounts receivable.   Accounts receivable are stated at the amount we expect to collect from outstanding balances and do not bear interest.  We provide for probable uncollectible amounts through an allowance for doubtful accounts, if an allowance is deemed necessary.  The allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable; however, changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future.  On a periodic basis, management evaluates our accounts receivable and determines the requirement for an allowance for doubtful accounts based on its assessment of the current and collectible status of individual accounts with past due balances over 90 days.  Account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.

15 

Revenue recognition . As all of our Revenue is generated from services offerings. Revenue recognition is the same for each of our revenue streams.  We recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement; (2) the service has been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable; and (4) the collection of its fees is reasonably assured.

Stock-based compensation.   We record stock based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718, which requires us to recognize expenses related to the fair value of our employee stock option awards.  This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method.  We recognize the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award. 

We account for equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from non-employees in accordance with FASB ASC 718-10 and the conclusions reached by the FASB ASC 505-50.  Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measureable.  The value of equity instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC 505-50.

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

An evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Financial Officer and Principal Executive Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report on Form 10-Q. Disclosure controls and procedures are procedures designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time period specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and is communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the material weaknesses identified at the audit.

Change in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.

There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this report that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
