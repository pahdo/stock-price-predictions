1.   
      Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     

Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements of
Table Trac, Inc. (the  Company,  or  Table Trac ) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.
The balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and the statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, and the statement of cash flows for the nine months ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited but include all
adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position at such date
and the operating results and cash flows for those periods. Certain information normally included in financial statements and related
footnotes prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles has been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The accompanying financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements and notes included in the Table Trac Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Nature of Business  

Table Trac was formed under the laws of the State of Nevada
in June 1995. The Company has its offices in Minnetonka, Minnesota. The Company has developed and sells an information and management
system that automates and monitors various aspects of the operations of casinos. 

Table Trac provides system sales and technical support to casinos.
System sales include installation, custom casino system configuration, and training. In addition, license and technical support
are provided under separate license and service contracts. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the
reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company uses estimates and assumptions in accounting
for the following significant matters, among others: revenue recognition, realizability of accounts receivable, the valuation of
deferred tax assets and liabilities, deferred revenue and costs, and other contingencies. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company derives revenues from the sales of systems, licenses
and maintenance fees, and services, and rental agreements. 

System Sales  

Revenue from systems that have been demonstrated to meet customer
specifications during installation is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered, title
and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. System sales,
which are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements, include multiple products and/or services. For multiple-element arrangements,
the Company allocates the revenue to each element based on the hierarchy of estimated selling price for the deliverables. The selling
price for each deliverable will be based on vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE), third party evidence ( TPE )
if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. The Company recognizes the associated
revenue when all revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element. If there are contracts for which the Company does
not have VSOE or TPE of all elements, the Company would follow the selling price hierarchy to allocate arrangement consideration. 

The Company does offer its customers contracts with extended
payment terms.  The Company must evaluate if any extended payment terms in the contract is an indicator of the revenue not
being fixed or determinable.  Provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied, the Company recognizes
the revenue if payment of a significant portion of the systems sales is due within 12 months of the delivery of the product. 
The Company also analyzes its standard business practice of using long-term contracts and the history of collecting on extended
payment term contracts without making concessions for determining if revenue should be recognized.  Revenue and associated
costs of sales are deferred if contract terms exceed historical collection results or if a substantial portion of the contract
is not due within 12 months after delivery of the product.  The Company analyzes each contract for proper revenue recognition
based on that contract s facts and circumstances.  Interest is recorded upon receipt to  interest income 
on the statements of operations.  

- 7 -  

Maintenance revenue  

Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract
period. The VSOE for maintenance is based upon the renewal rate for contracted services. 

Service revenue  

Service revenue is recognized after the services are performed
and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The VSOE for service revenue is established based upon actual
selling prices for the services or prior similar arrangements. 

Rental revenue  

The Company may offer customers a rental contract.  Revenues
are billed monthly on a per-game per-day basis. There is an option to purchase the system after the rental contract expires
at a pre-determined residual value. 

Deferred System Sales Costs  

Deferred system sales costs consist of installed system costs
incurred on participation-based contracts. These costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract which
is generally 18-48 months beginning when revenues are generated. At the end of the contract period, the customer will usually receive
title to the system. These costs are the most significant component of the other long-term assets on the balance sheet and are
$1,534,602 and $1,289,786 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Accounts Receivable / Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  

Accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount. Accounts
receivable are recorded at net realizable value, which includes foreign currency translation as of each balance sheet date. Accounts
receivable include unsecured regular customer receivables and unsecured amounts from financed contracts coming due within 12 months.
Amounts from financed contracts due beyond 12 months are recorded as  Long-term accounts receivable   financed contracts.   Interest
is recorded upon receipt to other income on the statements of operations. An allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded when the
Company believes the amounts may not be collected. Management believes that receivables, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts,
are fully collectible. Accounts receivable are written off when management determines collection is no longer likely. While the
ultimate result may differ, management believes that any write-off not allowed for will not have a material impact on the Company's
financial position. 

Major Customers  

The following tables summarize major customer information for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The Company derives a portion of its revenue from foreign customers.
For the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, sales to customers in South America represent 8.7% and 15.8% of total
revenues, respectively. 

- 8 -  

For the three month period ending September 30, 2016 and 2015,
sales to customers in South America represent 10.2% and 17.6% of total revenues, respectively. 

Inventory  

Inventory, consisting of finished goods, is stated at the lower
of cost or market. The average cost method, which approximates the first in, first out method, is used to value inventory. Inventory
is reviewed annually for the lower of cost or market and obsolescence. Any material cost found to be above market value or considered
obsolete is written down accordingly. The inventory value was $681,785 and $656,137 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, which included work-in-process of $12,039 and $34,259 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.
The Company had no obsolescence reserve at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 

Research and Development  

The Company expenses all costs related to research and development
as incurred. Research and development expense was $8,654 and $5,108 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and
$30,793 and $17,668 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research and development expenses are
included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the statements of operations. 

2.   
      Accounts Receivable     

Accounts receivable consisted of the following at: 

The allowance for financed and trade receivable represents management s
estimate of probable losses in our trade and financed receivables as of the date of the financial statements. The allowance provides
for probable losses that have been identified with specific customer relationships and for probable losses believed to be inherent
of the trade and financed receivables, but that have not been specifically identified. 

Accounts receivable includes financed contracts at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 which are $4,692,474 and $3,584,674, respectively, offset by deferred revenues on the balance sheets
of $4,052,469 and $2,890,467, respectively. 

- 9 -  

A roll-forward of the Company s allowance for doubtful
accounts is as follows: 

The allowance for doubtful accounts is $185,397 for the trade
receivables and $0 for the financed contracts at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

3.  Stockholders  Equity   

Stock Repurchase Program  

On December 23, 2014, the Company s Board of Directors
approved the repurchase of its outstanding common shares, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000, in both private unsolicited
and open  market transactions, until September 30, 2015. The board later increased this repurchase authorization by $75,000
on March 17, 2015, and by $50,000 on September 4, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, no further funds have been approved for the repurchase
program, and no authorized funds remain available for use in repurchasing the Company s shares. Company insiders are prohibited
from participating in the stock repurchase program. Since the beginning of the program, the Company has repurchased 240,269 shares
at an average price of $.95 per share through September 30, 2016. 

During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company
repurchased 36,300 shares totaling approximately $36,000 at an average price of $1.00 per share for its treasury. In March 2016,
the Company issued 7,500 shares at a price of $.85 per share from its treasury to a director, for services rendered during the
period July 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015, for a total expense of $6,375. As of September 30, 2016, the Company holds 152,269
common shares in treasury for possible future employee issuances for potential bonuses. Such common shares in treasury include
shares repurchased pursuant to the stock repurchase program. 

4. 
     Income Tax -  

The Company accounts for income taxes by following the asset
and liability approach to accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences
of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities versus the tax basis of assets and
liabilities. Under this method, deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and
tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets are reduced
by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. The impact of the tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the
year that the change is enacted. Management believes that any write-off not allowed for will not have a material impact on the
Company's financial position. 

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction
and various state jurisdictions. Based on its evaluation, the Company believes that it has no significant unrecognized tax positions.
The Company s evaluation was performed for the tax years ended December 31, 2012 through 2015, which are the tax years that
remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of September 30, 2016. The Company does not believe there will be any
material changes in its unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months. 

The Company may from time to time be assessed interest or penalties
by major tax jurisdictions, although any such assessments historically have been minimal and immaterial to its financial results.
In accordance with current guidance, the Company classifies interest and penalties as income tax expense is incurred. 

- 10 -  

5. 
     Earnings (loss) per share  

The Company computes earnings (loss) per share under two different
methods, basic and diluted, and presents per-share data for all periods in which statements of operations are presented. Basic
earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding.
Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common
stock and common stock equivalents outstanding. 

The following table provides a reconciliation of the numerators
and denominators used in calculating basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015: 

The Company had no common stock equivalents outstanding for
all periods ending September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. 

6. 
     Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  

The Company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise
from some of its foreign customers in Colombia, transacted in Colombia pesos. In addition, exchange rate fluctuations may cause
our international results to fluctuate when translated into U.S. dollars. These risks may change over time as business practices
evolve and could have an impact on the Company s financial results in the future due to the long term nature of the Company s
accounts receivable in Colombia, which totaled approximately $347,000 at September 30, 2016. The Company monitors its risk associated
with the volatility of certain foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar. 

7. 
     Commitment and Contingencies  

During 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with a contractor
to design and execute on a sales and marketing strategy for the Company in key Latin American and Caribbean gaming jurisdictions.
The agreement was extended in July of 2016 and currently expires December 31, 2017 unless terminated earlier in accordance with
the terms of the Agreement. The remaining commitment as of September 30, 2016 is approximately $93,750.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations   

Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations set forth below should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements, and
notes thereto, contained in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016 relating to our year ended December 31, 2015.  

Forward-Looking Statements  

Some of the statements made in this section of our report are
forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements generally relate to and are based upon our current plans, expectations,
assumptions and projections about future events.  Our management currently believes that the various plans, expectations,
and assumptions reflected in or suggested by these forward-looking statements are reasonable.  Nevertheless, all forward-looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties and our actual actions or future results may be materially different from our plans,
objectives or expectations, or our assumptions and projections underlying our present plans, objectives and expectations, which
are expressed in this report. 

In light of the foregoing, prospective investors are cautioned
that the forward-looking statements included in this filing may ultimately prove to be inaccurate - even materially inaccurate.  Because
of the significant uncertainties inherent in such forward-looking statements, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded
as a representation or warranty by Table Trac or any other person that our objectives, plans, expectations or projections that
are contained in this filing will be achieved in any specified time frame, if ever. 

General Overview  

Table Trac, Inc. is a Nevada corporation, formed on June 27,
1995, with principal offices in Minnetonka, Minnesota. 

The Company has developed and patented (U.S. patent # 5,957,776)
a proprietary information and management system (called our  Table Trac  system) that automates and monitors the operations
of casino table game operations. In addition to its table games management system, Table Trac has been adding functionality to
related casino system modules for guest rewards and loyalty club, marketing analysis, guest service, promotions, administration
/ management, vault / cage management and audit / accounting tasks. Aggregated together, all of these modules have become the  Casino
Trac  product, a full-featured Casino Management System (CMS) offering what we believe to be a powerful combination of value,
efficiency and reliability for casinos seeking to add or upgrade their casino systems. 

The Company sells systems and technical support to casinos.
The open architecture of the Table Trac system is designed to provide operators with a scalable and flexible system that can interconnect
and operate with most third-party software or hardware. Key products and services include modules designed to drive player tracking
programs and kiosk promotions, as well as vault and cage controls. The Company s systems are designed to meet strict auditing,
accounting and regulatory requirements applicable to the gaming industry. The Company has developed a patented, real-time system
that automates and monitors the operations of casino gaming tables. The Company continues to increase its market share by
expanding its product offerings to include new system features, ancillary products, and plans to pursue opportunities and strategic
partnerships. 

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company delivered one
casino management system, which most of the revenue for the delivered product will be recognized in future periods, since a substantial
amount is not due within 12 months. At the end of the quarter, the Company had casino management systems, table games management
systems and ancillary products installed with on-going support and maintenance contracts at 75 establishments in twelve U.S. states,
as well as countries in Central and South America, and the Caribbean. In addition, the Company signed two contracts during the
third quarter with a total value of approximately $318,000 with product delivery scheduled in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Also during the third quarter of 2016, the Company was granted
a Manufacturer and Distributor license by the Nevada Gaming Commission. The license approval will allow the Company to pursue business
with casinos in Nevada. 

Discussion of Critical Accounting Policies   

There were no changes to our accounting policies for the quarter.
For our existing policies, see Note 1 in our financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015. 

Results of Operations - Three Months Ended September 30,
2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, loss from
operations was $101,500 compared to a loss from operations of $284,411 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The major
components of revenues, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses, and the reasons for changes in each, are
discussed below. 

Revenues  

Revenues totaled $1,159,530 for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $811,841 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The following table summarizes our revenues
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

- 12 -  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
delivered one system, with most of the related revenue expected to be recognized in future periods, since a substantial amount
is not due within 12 months. During the same period in 2015, the Company delivered one system domestically and additional systems
in South America. Most of the revenue was deferred for each of those systems delivered. Other sales, which include third party
products, increased over 2015 as a result of hardware items ordered by existing customers during the three months ended September
30, 2016. 

Cost of Sales  

Cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016
increased to $378,829 from $254,909 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The following table summarizes our cost
of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

The Company's gross profit was 67.3% and 68.6% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and is primarily due to the consistent mix of hardware sold with the systems. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general
and administrative expenses were $882,201 compared to $841,343 for the same period in 2015.  Most of the increase in
operating expenses is related to the costs of the process of attaining state licenses during the third quarter of 2016. 

Interest Income  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest income
was $29,324 compared to $20,138 for the same period in 2015.  This increase is primarily related to the interest earned
on recently signed contracts that have financed payment plans. 

Tax Provision  

The income tax benefit for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $844, which was calculated at a 1.1% effective rate, compared to an income tax benefit of $93,400 for the same period
in 2015, which was calculated at a 35.3% effective rate. The difference in the effective rates is caused by a small net income
number with high nondeductible expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Net Income (Loss)  

Net loss before taxes for the three months ended September 30,
2016, was $75,457 compared to loss before taxes of $264,273 for the same period in 2015. Net loss for the three months ended September
30, 2016 was $74,613 compared to a net loss of $170,873 for the same period in 2015. The basic and diluted loss per share was $0.02
compared to loss per share of $0.04 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Results of Operations - Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, loss from operations
was $3,022 compared to a loss from operations of $476,036 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The major components of
revenues, cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses are discussed below. 

- 13 -  

Revenues  

Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased
to $4,020,700 from $2,885,461 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The following table summarizes our revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
delivered nine systems. Most of the revenue for six of these installations was deferred, and will be recurring in future periods,
since a substantial amount is not due within 12 months. During the same period in 2015, four systems were delivered with most of
the revenue deferred to future periods. Other sales, which include third party products, increased over 2015 as a result of hardware
items ordered by existing customers during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Cost of Sales  

Cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased
to $1,137,314 from $905,755 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The following table summarizes our cost of sales
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

The Company's gross profit was 71.8% and 68.6% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This increase is primarily due to the mix of hardware sold with our systems. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general
and administrative expenses were $2,886,408 compared to $2,455,742 for the same period in 2015.  Our most significant
changes in operating expenses are related to the process of attaining state licenses during the first nine months of 2016. 

Interest Income  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest income
was $71,725 compared to $37,142 for the same period in 2015.  This increase is primarily related to more contracts financed
through the Company in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 

Tax Provision  

The income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was $44,983, which was calculated at a 92.4% effective rate, compared to a benefit of $160,400 for the same period in 2015,
which was calculated at a 36.5% effective rate. The difference in the effective rates is caused by a small net income number with
high nondeductible expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Net Income (Loss)  

Income before taxes for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, was $48,668 compared to a loss before taxes of $438,894 for same period in 2015. Net income for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $3,685 compared to a net loss of $278,494 for the same period in 2015. The basic and diluted income per share was
$0.00 compared to a loss per share of $0.06 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Backlog  

The Company s backlog generally consists of incomplete
system installations and expansion of offerings for currently installed and supported systems. 

The Company had three projects in its backlog at September 30,
2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $183,060 compared
to cash of $349,461 on September 30, 2015. The decrease in cash on hand is related primarily to the cash paid for state licensing,
and repurchases of stock. 

We do not know of any trends, events or uncertainties that are
likely to have a material impact on our short or long-term liquidity or our capital resources. We expect that our primary source
of liquidity in both the short and long-term will be system sales and the resulting license and maintenance fees generated from
existing systems. We anticipate we will be able to manage expenses and cash flow in order to satisfy our monthly expense obligations
with cash flow from operations. We believe the Company has adequate cash flows for at least the next 12 months to meet its obligations
and continue operations for both existing and future customers as well as ongoing sales efforts and product development. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September
30, 2016. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide
reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. 

As of September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer / Chief
Financial Officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined
in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer / Chief
Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Remediation of Material Weakness in Internal Control over
Financial Reporting   

We have improved our procedures related to the period end financial
reporting and designed more effective controls to remediate the material weakness described in Item 9A of our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. As noted, as of June 30, 2016 in the 10-Q filed August 10, 2016, management implemented
new controls related to the financial reporting of a contractor in Colombia that were previously missing. We believe these measures
have strengthened our internal controls over financial reporting and should prevent a reoccurrence of the material weakness described
in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

approved the repurchase of its outstanding common shares, in an aggregate amount of up to $100,000, in both private unsolicited

on March 17, 2015, and by $50,000 on September 4, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, no further funds have been approved for the repurchase
