Item 1.  Business.
         --------

     (a)  General Development of Business.
          -------------------------------

          North European Oil Royalty Trust (the "Trust") is a grantor trust
which, on behalf of the owners of beneficial interest in the Trust (the "unit
owners"), holds overriding royalty rights covering gas and oil production in
certain concessions or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.  The rights
are held under contracts with local German exploration and development
subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. ("ExxonMobil") and the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group of Companies ("Royal Dutch/Shell Group").  Under these contracts, the
Trust receives various percentage royalties on the proceeds of the sales of
certain products from the areas involved.  At the present time, royalties
are received for sales of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate
and sulfur.  See Item 2 of this Report for descriptions of the relationships
of these companies and certain of these contracts.

          The royalty rights were received by the Trust from North European
Oil Company (the "Company") upon dissolution of the Company in September
1975.  The Company was organized in 1957 as the successor to North European
Oil Corporation (the "Corporation").  The Trust is administered by trustees
(the "Trustees") under an Agreement of Trust dated September 10, 1975, as
amended (the "Trust Agreement").

          Neither the Trust nor the Trustees on behalf of the Trust conduct
any active business activities or operations.  The function of the Trustees
is to monitor, verify, collect, hold, invest and distribute the royalty
payments made to the Trust.  Under the Trust Agreement, the Trustees make
quarterly distributions of the net funds received by the Trust on behalf of
the unit owners.  Funds temporarily held by the Trust are invested in
interest bearing bank deposits, money market accounts, certificates of
deposit, U.S. Treasury Bills or other government obligations.

          There has been no significant change in the principal operation or
purpose of the Trust during the past fiscal year.

          As part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX"), the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") adopted rules implementing
legislation concerning governance matters for publicly held entities.  The
Trust is complying with the requirements of the SEC and SOX and, at this
time, the Trustees have chosen not to request any relief from those
provisions based on the passive nature of the Trust but may do so in the
future.  In that connection, the Trustees have directed that certain of the
additional statements and disclosures set forth or incorporated by reference
in this Report, which the SEC requires of corporations, be made even though
some of such statements and disclosures might not now or in the future be
required to be made by the Trust.

          In addition, the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE"), where units
of beneficial interest of the Trust are listed for trading, has additional
corporate governance rules as set forth in Section 303A of the NYSE Listed
Company Manual.  Most of the governance requirements promulgated by the NYSE
are not applicable to the Trust, which is a passive entity acting as a
royalty trust and holds only overriding royalty rights.  The Trust does not

                                  - 5 -

engage in any operating or active business.  The Trustees have, however,
chosen to constitute an Audit Committee and a Compensation Committee but
may not necessarily do so in the future.

(b)  Financial Information about Segments.
          ------------------------------------

          Since the Trust conducts no active business operations, an
analysis by segments is accordingly not applicable to the Trust.  To the
extent that royalty income received by the Trust is attributable to sales
of different products, to sales from different geographic areas or to sales
by different operating companies, this information is set forth in Item 2 of
this Report and the Exhibit described in that Item 2.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business.
          ---------------------------------

          Under the Trust Agreement, the Trust conducts no active business
operations and is restricted to collection of income from royalty rights and
distribution to unit owners of the net income after payment of administrative
and related expenses.

          The overriding royalty rights held by the Trust are derived from
contracts and agreements originally entered into by German subsidiaries of
the predecessor Corporation during the early 1930s.  The Trust's primary
royalty rights are based on government granted concessions and remain in
effect as long as there are continued production activities and/or
exploration efforts by the operating companies.  It is generally anticipated
that the operating companies will continue production where it remains
economically profitable for them to do so.  In addition, the Trust holds
other royalty rights, which are based on leases which have passed their
original expiration dates.  These leases remain in effect as long as there
is continued production or the lessor does not cancel the lease.  Individual
lessors will normally not seek termination of the rights originally granted
because the leases provide for royalty payments to the lessors if sales of
oil or gas result from discoveries made on the leased land.  Additionally,
termination by individual lessors would result in the escheat of mineral
rights to the applicable state.

          Royalties are paid to the Trust on sales from production under
these leases and concessions by the operating companies on a regular monthly
or quarterly basis pursuant to the royalty agreements.  The operating
companies make royalty payments to the Trust exclusively in Euros.  As
promptly as possible after the funds are deposited in the Trust's bank
account in Germany, they are converted into U.S. dollars based upon the next
available Bloomberg fixing, which is currently set at 2:00 p.m. Frankfurt
time.  Following this conversion to dollars, the royalties are transferred to
the Trust's bank account in the U.S.  The Trust does not engage in activities
to hedge against currency risk and the fluctuations in the conversion rate
impact its financial results.  However, since the actual royalty deposits are
held as Euros for such a limited time, the market risk with respect to these
deposits is small.  The Trust has not experienced any difficulty in
effecting the conversion of Euros into U.S. dollars.

          As the holder of overriding royalty rights, the Trust has no legal
ability, whether by contract or operation of law, to compel production.
Moreover, if an operator should determine to terminate production in any

                                  - 6 -

concession or lease area and to surrender the concession or lease, the
royalty rights for that area would thereby be terminated.  Under certain
royalty agreements, the operating companies are required to advise the
Trust of any intention to surrender lease or concession rights.  While the
Trust itself is precluded from undertaking any production activities,
possible residual rights might permit the Trust to take up a surrendered
concession or lease and attempt to retain a third-party operator to develop
such concession or lease.

          The exploration for and the production of gas and oil is a
speculative business.  The Trust has no means of ensuring continued income
from its royalty rights at either their present levels or otherwise.  The
Trust has no role in any of the operating companies' decision-making
processes, such as gas pricing, gas sales or exploration, which can impact
royalty income.  In addition, fluctuations in prices and supplies of gas
and oil and the effect these fluctuations might have on royalty income to
the Trust and on reserves net to the Trust cannot be accurately projected.
Finally, natural gas and crude oil are wasting assets.  While known reserves
may increase as additional development adds quantities to the reserve
amount, the amount of known and unknown reserves is finite and will decline
over time.  Given these factors, along with the uncertainty in worldwide and
local German economic conditions and the fact that the Trustees have no
information beyond that information which is generally available to the
public, the Trustees make no projections regarding future royalty income.

          While Germany has laws relating to environmental protection, the
Trustees generally do not have detailed information concerning the present or
possible effect of such laws on operations in areas where the Trust holds
royalty rights on production and sale of products from those areas.  However,
the Trustees were informed by the Trust's German consultant that on July 8,
2016, a hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") law was passed in Germany
permitting fracking in sandstone at any depth.  The new law requires that an
environmental impact study be performed as well as requiring that permission
by the relevant water authority be granted to protect drinking water
supplies.  Based upon an analysis of the details of this law, the Trust's
German consultant has informed the Trust that fracking will be permitted in
all current productive zones within the Oldenburg concession both due to the
depths involved and the nature of the productive zones.  However, the
operating companies would still have to comply with all regulatory
requirements governing the use of fracking. Historically, the only productive
zone within the concession that required fracking has been the Carboniferous
zone.  No Carboniferous wells are currently listed in the drilling schedule
through 2020.

          Seasonal demand factors affect the income from royalty rights
insofar as they relate to energy demands and increases or decreases in
prices, but on average they are generally not material to the regular annual
income received under the royalty rights.

          The Trust, in cooperation with a parallel royalty owner (Unitarian
Universalist Congregation at Shelter Rock), arranges for periodic
examinations of the books and records of the operating companies to verify
compliance with the computation provisions of the applicable agreements.
From time to time, these examinations disclose computational errors or
errors from inappropriate application of existing agreements and appropriate
adjustments are requested and made.  As a result of the recent amendments to
the Trust's royalty agreements which effect pricing simplification, future
examinations by the Trust's German accountants will be simplified since these
examinations will be primarily limited to the verification of the gas

                                  - 7 -

quantities sold.  Although these periodic examinations may also disclose
other matters that are subject to dispute between the parties, these disputes
have historically been resolved through negotiations.

(d)  Financial Information about Geographic Areas.
          ---------------------------------------------

          The Trust does not engage in any active business operations, and
its sources of income are the overriding royalty rights covering gas, sulfur
and oil production in certain areas in Germany and interest on the funds
temporarily invested by the Trustees.  In Item 2 of this Report, there is a
schedule (by product, geographic area and operating company) showing the
royalty income received by the Trust during the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2016.

(e)  Trustees and Executive Officers of the Trust.
          --------------------------------------------

          As specified in the Trust Agreement, the affairs of the Trust are
managed by not more than five individual Trustees who receive compensation
determined under that same agreement.  One of the Trustees is designated as
Managing Trustee.  Robert P. Adelman has served as Managing Trustee (non-
executive) since November 1, 2006.  In addition, Samuel M. Eisenstat serves
as Chairman for the Audit and Compensation Committees, and Lawrence A. Kobrin
serves as Clerk to the Trustees (a role similar to that of a corporate
secretary).  For these services, these three individuals receive additional
compensation.

          Day-to-day matters are handled by the Managing Director, John R.
Van Kirk, who also serves as CEO and CFO.  John R. Van Kirk has held the
position of Managing Director of the Trust since November 1990.  The Managing
Director provides office space and services at cost to the Trust.

          In addition to the Managing Director, the Trust has one
administrative employee in the United States, whose title is Administrator.
The Trust has retained the services of a consultant in Germany who has broad
experience in the petroleum industry and from whom it receives reports on a
regular basis.  The Trust also retains an accounting firm and a legal firm
in Germany to advise and represent the Trust as needed.  Because the Trust
has only two employees, employee relations or labor contracts are not
directly material to the business or income of the Trust.  The Trustees have
no information concerning employee relations of the operating companies.

(f)  Available Information.
          ---------------------

          The Trust maintains a website at www.neort.com.  The Trust's Annual
Reports, Form 10-K annual reports, Form 10-Q quarterly reports and the
Definitive Proxy Statements are available through the Trust's website as soon
as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with or furnished to
the SEC.  Press releases and tax letters are available through the website as
soon as practicable after release.  The North European Oil Royalty Trust
Agreement (as amended), the Trust's Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, the
Trustees' Regulations and the Trust's Audit Committee Charter are also
available through the Trust's website.  The Trust's website and the

                                  - 8 -

information contained in it and connected to it shall not be deemed
incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors.
          ------------

          The results of operations and financial condition of the Trust are
subject to various risks. Some of these risks are described below, and you
should take such risks into account in evaluating the Trust or any investment
decision involving the Trust.  This section does not describe all risks that
may be applicable to the Trust and it is intended only as a summary of
certain material risk factors.  More detailed information concerning the risk
factors described below is contained in other sections of this Annual Report
on Form 10-K.

The Trust does not conduct any active business activities or operations and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
has no legal ability to compel production.
-----------------------------------------

          The Trust holds overriding royalty rights only.  It is a passive
entity and conducts no operations.  It can exert no influence on the
operating companies that conduct exploration, drilling, production and sales
activities in the areas covered by the Trust's overriding royalty rights.
Thus, the Trust has no means of ensuring continued income from its
overriding royalty rights.  The failure of an operator to conduct its
operations, discharge its obligations, deal with regulatory agencies or
comply with laws, rules and regulations, including environmental laws
and regulations, in a proper manner could have an adverse effect on the
net proceeds payable to the Trust.  The Trust also has no right to remove
or replace an operator.

          The current operating companies are under no obligation to
continue operations in the royalty areas.  Natural gas is a wasting asset.
The production and sale of natural gas, from which the Trust derives its
royalties, reduces the amount of remaining proved producing reserves of
natural gas.  If the operating companies do not perform additional
development projects which replace at least a portion of the current
production, the anticipated life of the Trust will not be extended and could
be shortened.  Absent further additions to the amount of proved producing
reserves, production and sales will reach a point in the future where the
level of sales will no longer be commercially viable and production will
cease.   Ultimately, the amount of known and unknown reserves within a
defined area, such as the Oldenburg concession, is finite and will decline
over time.

Trust reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may prove to be
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
inaccurate, and these inaccuracies may cause errors in the reserve estimates.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The value of Trust units may depend in part on the reserves
attributable to the royalty areas. The calculations performed in the
process of estimating proved producing reserves are inherently uncertain.
The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of
available data, engineering interpretation and judgment, and the assumptions

                                  - 9 -

used regarding the quantities of recoverable natural gas and the future
prices of crude oil and natural gas.

          The Trust currently receives quarterly reports from the operating
companies with respect to production and sales on either a well-by-well or an
area-wide basis.  The Trust also receives annual reports from the operating
companies with respect to current and planned drilling and exploration
efforts.  These reports are very limited in nature.  The operating companies'
unified exploration and production venture, ExxonMobil Production Deutschland
GmbH ("EMPG"), which provides these reports to the Trust, continues to limit
the information flow to that which is required by German law, and the Trust
has no legal or contractual right to compel the issuance of additional
information.  The Trust's inability to compel the delivery of detailed
information with respect to individual wells increases the possibility of
inaccuracy in the petroleum engineering consultant's estimates of reserves.

          Actual production, revenues and expenditures by the operating
companies for the royalty areas, and therefore actual net proceeds payable to
the Trust, will vary from estimates and those variations could be material.
Additionally, while the moratorium on fracking has been lifted and there are
no wells currently in the drilling portfolio that require fracking, the
fracking law has mandated added regulatory steps with respect to all
drilling.  The new law requires that an environmental impact study be
performed as well as requiring that permission by the relevant water
authority be granted to protect drinking water supplies.  These additional
regulations will add costs to each well.  When used, the process of fracking
adds significant costs to drilling.  The operating companies will have to
evaluate these costs as part of their decision on whether or not to drill.

The effects of fluctuations in prices of gas and oil and changes in worldwide
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
and local economic conditions on the royalty income paid to the Trust cannot
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
be accurately projected.
-----------------------

          The Trust's distributions are highly dependent upon the prices
realized from the sale of natural gas and a decrease in such prices could
reduce the amount of cash distributions paid to unit owners.

          Oil and natural gas prices and demand for these products can
fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors that are beyond the
control of the Trust. Factors that contribute to these fluctuations include,
among others: (1) worldwide and German economic conditions and levels of
economic activity; (2) political and economic conditions in major oil
producing regions, especially in the Middle East and Russia; (3) weather
conditions; (4) the price of oil or natural gas imported into Germany; (5)
the level of consumer demand in Germany; (6) the increasing role of alternate
energy sources along with the German government's and European Union's role
in promoting those sources; and (7) German and European Union governmental
actions intended to broaden sources of energy supply.

          When oil and natural gas prices decline, the Trust is affected in
two ways. First, net income from the royalty areas is reduced. Second,

- 10 -

exploration and development activity by the operating companies on the
royalty areas may decline as some projects may become uneconomic and are
either delayed or eliminated. It is impossible to predict future oil and
natural gas price movements, and this, along with other factors, make
future cash distributions to unit owners impossible to predict.

          In recent years, there has been a shift in the structure of
European gas supply contracts resulting in the decoupling of the link between
oil prices and gas prices.  A comprehensive spot market has developed in
Europe with corresponding spot market prices for gas where the gas price is
not linked to oil prices.  According to the Trust's accountants in Germany,
gas prices, in the overwhelming majority of contracts, are linked to spot
market prices on a specific exchange with a plus or minus factor included.
However, following the August 26, 2016 amendments to the royalty agreements
regarding the pricing simplification, neither the contractual price nor the
spot market price will be a determining factor in the calculation of
royalties payable to the Trust.  As specified in the amendments, the Trust's
new pricing procedure now matches the German State royalty calculation basis
which is codified in the pertinent German State Royalty Code
(Niedersachsische Verordnung uber die Feldes- und die Forderabgabe).  As this
pricing procedure is currently configured, the state assessment base for
natural gas is the average German Border Import gas Price (the "GBIP").  In
the royalty calculations for the Trust, the GBIP for the period corresponding
to the respective calendar quarter (adjusted by a percentage factor) will be
the price used in the relevant calculation of quarterly royalties payable.
In September following the end of a given calendar year, the average GBIP for
that year (adjusted by a percentage factor) will be the price used in the
relevant year-end royalty adjustments.

Changes in the dollar value of the Euro have an immediate impact on the Trust.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

          For unit owners, changes in the dollar value of the Euro have an
immediate impact.  This impact occurs at the time the royalties, which are
paid to the Trust in Euros, are converted into U.S. dollars based upon the
applicable exchange rate and transferred from Germany to the United States.
In relation to the dollar, a stronger Euro would yield more dollars and a
weaker Euro would yield less dollars.

Cyber security risks and cyber incidents at the Trust or the operating
----------------------------------------------------------------------
companies could adversely affect our business.
----------------------------------------------

          Cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional
events. These incidents can include, but are not limited to, gaining
unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating
assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational
disruption. The result of these incidents could include, but are not limited
to, disrupted operations, misstated financial data, liability for stolen
assets or information, increased cyber security protection costs, litigation
and reputational damage adversely affecting investor confidence.

Item 2.   Properties.
          ----------

          The properties of the Trust, which the Trust and Trustees hold
pursuant to the Trust Agreement on behalf of the unit owners, are overriding
royalty rights on sales of gas, sulfur and oil under certain concessions or
leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.  The actual leases or concessions
are held either by Mobil Erdgas-Erdol GmbH ("Mobil Erdgas"), a German
operating subsidiary of ExxonMobil, or by Oldenburgische Erdolgesellschaft
("OEG").  As a result of direct and indirect ownership, ExxonMobil owns two-
thirds of OEG and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of Companies owns one-third of
OEG.  The Oldenburg concession (1,386,000 acres), covering virtually the
entire former Grand Duchy of Oldenburg and located in the German federal
state of Lower Saxony, provides 100% of the royalties received by the Trust.
BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a joint venture in which ExxonMobil and
the Royal Dutch/Shell Group each own 50%, administers the concession held by
OEG.  In 2002, Mobil Erdgas and BEB formed EMPG to carry out all exploration,
drilling and production activities.  All sales activities are still handled
by either Mobil Erdgas or BEB.

          Vermilion Energy Inc. ("Vermilion"), a Canadian based international
oil and gas producer, entered into a Farm-In Agreement (the "Farm-In
Agreement") with Mobil Erdgas and BEB.  The Farm-In Agreement specifies that
Vermilion has acquired an interest in various portions of a concession or
areas owned by Mobil Erdgas and BEB.  Three of these licenses cover the three
northernmost areas of the Oldenburg concession.  The Farm-In Agreement
commits Vermilion to financial participation at a 50% level in 11 gross
exploratory wells over the next five years.  If Vermilion conducts any
successful drilling within the confines of the Oldenburg concession, sales of
that gas or oil would be subject to the relevant royalty contract.  The
Trust's German consultant has confirmed for the Trust that Vermilion will
lead the development of its first well within the Oldenburg concession with a
possible start time in 2019.  The well is tentatively located in the western
portion of the area designated Oldenburg-Land, the southernmost area of the
three areas within the concession subject to Vermilion's Farm-In Agreement.
Vermilion's well is intended to develop the Rotliegend (Red Sandstone)
formation, a previously undeveloped productive zone within the concession.

          Under one set of rights covering the western part of the Oldenburg
concession (approximately 662,000 acres), the Trust receives a royalty
payment of 4% on gross receipts from sales by Mobil Erdgas of gas well gas,
oil well gas, crude oil and condensate (the "Mobil Agreement").  Under the
Mobil Agreement there is no deduction of costs prior to the calculation of
royalties from gas well gas and oil well gas, which together account for
approximately 99% of all the royalties under said agreement.  Historically,
the Trust has received significantly greater royalty payments under the Mobil
Agreement (as compared to the OEG Agreement described below) due to the
higher royalty rate specified by that agreement.

          The Trust is also entitled under the Mobil Sulfur Agreement to
receive a 2% royalty on gross receipts of sales of sulfur obtained as a
by-product of sour gas produced from the western part of Oldenburg.  The
payment of the sulfur royalty is conditioned upon sales of sulfur by Mobil
Erdgas at a selling price above an agreed upon base price.  This base price
is adjusted annually by an inflation index.  When the average quarterly
selling price falls below the indexed base price, no sulfur royalties are
paid by Mobil Erdgas.  Sulfur royalties under the Mobil Agreement totaled
($51,576), $78,094 and $375,614 during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014,
respectively.  The 2016 figure includes negative adjustments from 2015, 2013,

                                  - 12 -

2012 and 2011 of $36,336, $43,087, $186,045 and $56,225, which more than
offset sulfur royalties payable.  The 2015 figure includes negative
adjustments from 2014 and 2013 of $80,516 and $134,832, respectively.  The
operating companies had improperly allocated eastern sulfur sales to the
Mobil Agreement during 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011 resulting in the
overpayment of sulfur royalties.

          Under another set of rights covering the entire Oldenburg
concession and pursuant to the agreement with OEG, the Trust receives
royalties at the rate of 0.6667% on gross receipts from sales by BEB of gas
well gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur (removed during the
processing of sour gas) less a certain allowed deduction of costs (the "OEG
Agreement").  Under the OEG Agreement, 50% of the field handling and
treatment costs as reported for state royalty purposes are deducted from the
gross sales receipts prior to the calculation of the royalty to be paid to
the Trust.

          On August 26, 2016, the Trust executed amendments to its existing
royalty agreements with OEG and Mobil establishing a new base for the
determination of gas prices upon which the Trust's royalties are determined.
This new base is set as the state assessment base for natural gas used by the
operating companies in their calculation of royalties payable to the State of
Lower Saxony.  Currently, this change reflects a shift from the use of gas
ex-field prices ("contractual prices") to the prices calculated for the GBIP.
For simplification purposes, we will use "GBIP" when referring to the current
state assessment base.

          The change to the GBIP is intended to be revenue neutral for the
Trust.  Additionally, this change should reduce the scope and cost of the
accounting examination, eliminate ongoing disputes with OEG and Mobil
regarding sales to related parties, and reduce prior year adjustments to the
normally scheduled year-end reconciliation.  The new pricing basis will also
eliminate certain costs (transportation and plant gas storage) that were
previously deductible prior to the royalty calculation under the agreement
with OEG.

          Actual gas sales from the prior calendar quarter will be multiplied
by the average GBIP for a period starting two months earlier and will provide
the basis for royalty payments to the Trust during its fiscal quarter.  The
average GBIP for the corresponding period of actual sales is not available
due to the delay in its calculation.  In the final calculation of royalties
payable for calendar 2015, the average GBIP under the Mobil and OEG Royalty
Agreements was increased by 2% and 5%, respectively.  For calendar 2016 and
forward, the average GBIP under the Mobil and OEG Royalty Agreements will be
increased by 1% and 3%, respectively.   In March of the following calendar
year, an average GBIP for the prior calendar year (weighted on a monthly
basis by the respective volume of imported gas) is published.  In September
of the following calendar year, EMPG will make a final reconciliation based
upon the published yearly average GBIP increased by the respective percentage
factor and the total volume of gas sold under the royalty agreements during
the prior calendar year.

          The new basis for oil prices would be the published price from the
State Authority for Mining, Energy and Geology.  There are no percentage
adjustments factored into the oil royalty calculation.  There was no change
in the previous methodology used with regard to the determination of
royalties attributable to sales of sulfur.

          In addition to the Oldenburg area, the Trust also holds overriding
royalties at various rates on a number of currently non-producing leases of
various sizes in other areas of Germany.  One of these leases, Grosses Meer,
was formerly active but provided no royalties during fiscal 2016, 2015 and
2014.

Exhibit 99.1 to this Report is a report entitled Calculation of Cost
Depletion Percentage for the 2016 Calendar Year Based on the Estimate of
Remaining Proved Producing Reserves in the Northwest Basin of the Federal
Republic of Germany as of October 1, 2016 (the "Cost Depletion Report").
The Cost Depletion Report, dated November 30, 2016, was prepared by Ralph E.
Davis Associates, LLC, 711 Louisiana Street, Suite 3100, Houston, Texas 77002
("Davis Associates").  Davis Associates is an independent petroleum and
natural gas consulting organization specialized in analyzing hydrocarbon
reserves.

          The Cost Depletion Report provides documentation supporting the
calculation of the cost depletion percentage for the 2016 calendar year
based on the use of certain production data and the estimated net proved
producing reserves as of October 1, 2016 for the primary area in which the
Trust holds overriding royalty rights.  The cost depletion percentage is
prepared for the Trust's unit owners for tax reporting purposes.  The cost
depletion percentage recommended by the Trust's independent petroleum and
natural gas consultants for calendar 2016 is 10.2769%.  In order to permit
timely filing of the Cost Depletion Report and consistent with the practice
of the Trust in prior years, the information has been prepared for the 12-
month period ended September 30, 2016.  While this is one month prior to the
end of the fiscal year of the Trust, the information available for production

                                 - 14 -

and sales through the end of September is the most complete information
available at a date early enough to permit the timely preparation of the
various reports required.  Unit owners are referred to the full text of the
Cost Depletion Report contained herein for further details.

          The primary purpose of the Cost Depletion Report is the preparation
of the cost depletion percentage for use by unit owners in their own tax
reporting.  The only information provided to the Trust that can be utilized
in the calculation of the cost depletion percentage is current and historical
production and sales of proved producing reserves.  For the western half of
the Oldenburg Concession, the Trust received quarterly production and sales
information on a well-by-well basis.  For the eastern half of the Oldenburg
Concession, the Trust receives cumulative quarterly production and sales
information on two general areas.  These general areas encompass numerous
fields with varying numbers of wells.  Pursuant to the arrangements under
which the Trust holds royalty rights and the fact that the Trust is not
considered an operating company within Germany, the Trust has no access to
the operating companies' proprietary information concerning producing field
reservoir data.  The Trustees have been advised by their German counsel that
publication of such information is not required under applicable law in
Germany and that the royalty rights do not grant the Trust the right to
require or compel the release of such information.  Past efforts to obtain
such information from the operating companies have not been successful.
The information made available to the Trust by the operating companies does
not include any of the following: reserve estimates, capitalized costs,
production cost estimates, revenue projections, producing field reservoir
data (including pressure data, permeability, porosity and thickness of
producing zone) or other similar information.  While the limited information
available to the Trust permits the calculation of the cost depletion
percentage, it does not change the uncertainty with respect to the estimate
of proved producing reserves.  In addition, it is impossible for the Trust or
its consultant to make estimates of proved undeveloped or probable future net
recoverable oil and gas by appropriate geographic areas.

          The Trust has the authority to examine, but only for certain
limited purposes, the operating companies' sales and production from the
royalty areas.  The Trust also has access to published materials in Germany
from W.E.G. (a German organization equivalent to the American Petroleum
Institute or the American Gas Association).  The use of such statistical
information relating to production and sales necessarily involves
extrapolations and projections.  Both Davis Associates and the Trustees
believe the use of the material available is appropriate and suitable for
preparation of the cost depletion percentage and the estimates described in
the Cost Depletion Report.  The Trustees and Davis Associates believe this
report and these estimates to be reasonable and appropriate but assume that
these estimates may vary from statistical estimates which could be made if
reservoir production information (of the kind normally available to
producing companies in the United States) were available.  The limited
information available makes it inappropriate to make projections or estimates
of proved or probable reserves of any category or class other than the
estimated net proved producing reserves described in the Cost Depletion
Report.

          Attachment A of the Cost Depletion Report shows a schedule of
estimated net proved producing reserves of the Trust's royalty properties,
computed as of October 1, 2016 and a five year schedule of gas, sulfur and
oil sales for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013
and 2012 computed from quarterly sales reports of operating companies
received by the Trust during such periods.

          The Trust's units of beneficial interest are listed for trading on
the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NRT.  Under the Trust Agreement,
the Trustees distribute to unit owners, on a quarterly basis, the net royalty
income after deducting expenses and reserving limited funds for anticipated
administrative expenses.  As of November 30, 2016, there were 700 unit
owners of record.

          The quarterly distributions to unit owners represent their
undivided interest in royalty payments from sales of gas, sulfur and oil
during the previous quarter.  Each unit owner is entitled to recover a
portion of his or her investment in these royalty rights through a cost
depletion percentage.  The calculation of this cost depletion percentage is
set forth in detail in Attachment B to the Cost Depletion Report attached as
Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.

          The Cost Depletion Report has been prepared by Davis Associates
using the limited information described in Item 2 of this Report to which
reference is made.  The Trustees believe that the calculations and
assumptions used in the Cost Depletion Report are reasonable according to
the facts and circumstances of available information. The cost depletion
percentage recommended by the Trust's independent petroleum and natural gas
consultants for calendar 2016 is 10.2769%.  Specific details relative to the
Trust's income and expenses and cost depletion percentage as they apply to
the calculation of taxable income for the 2016 calendar year are included on
special removable pages in the 2016 Annual Report.  Additionally, the tax
reporting information for 2016 is available on the Trust's website,
www.neort.com, in the section marked Tax Letters contained within the Tax
Information section.

          The Trust does not maintain any compensation plans under which
units are authorized for issuance.  The Trust did not make any repurchases of
Trust units during fiscal 2016, 2015 or 2014 and has never made such
repurchases.

Item 7.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
         -----------------------------------------------------------
         and Results of Operations.
         -------------------------

Executive Summary
-----------------

          The Trust is a passive fixed investment trust which holds overriding
royalty rights, receives income under those rights from certain operating
companies, pays its expenses and distributes the remaining net funds to its
unit owners.  As mandated by the Trust Agreement, distributions of income are
made on a quarterly basis.  These distributions, as determined by the
Trustees, constitute substantially all of the funds on hand after provision
is made for Trust expenses then anticipated.

          The Trust does not engage in any business or extractive operations
of any kind in the areas over which it holds royalty rights and is precluded
from engaging in such activities by the Trust Agreement.  There are no
requirements, therefore, for capital resources with which to make capital
expenditures or investments in order to continue the receipt of royalty
revenues by the Trust.

          The properties of the Trust are described in Item 2. Properties of
this Report.  Of particular importance with respect to royalty income are the
two royalty agreements, the Mobil Agreement and the OEG Agreement.  The Mobil
Agreement covers gas sales from the western part of the Oldenburg concession.
Under the Mobil Agreement, the Trust has traditionally received the majority
of its royalty income due to the higher royalty rate of 4%.  The OEG Agreement
covers gas sales from the entire Oldenburg concession but the royalty rate of
0.6667% is significantly lower and gas royalties have been correspondingly
lower.

          The operating companies pay monthly royalties to the Trust based
on their sales of natural gas, sulfur and oil. Of these three products,
natural gas provided approximately 96% of the total royalties in fiscal 2016.
The amount of royalties paid to the Trust is primarily based on four factors:
the amount of gas sold, the price of that gas, the area from which the gas is
sold and the exchange rate.

          On approximately the 25th of the months of January, April, July and
October, the operating companies calculate the amount of gas sold during the
previous calendar quarter and determine the amount of royalties that were
payable to the Trust based on those sales.  The pricing component to this
royalty calculation no longer conforms to the same period.  Due to the delay
in the availability of the GBIP, the average GBIP for a three-month period
ending two months prior to the end of the relevant calendar quarter is used.
The average GBIP is increased by a percentage factor depending upon which
royalty agreement forms the underlying basis for the royalty calculation.
The respective royalty amount is divided into thirds and forms the monthly
royalty payments to the Trust (payable on the 15th of each month) for the
Trust's upcoming fiscal quarter.  At the same time that the operating
companies determine the actual amount of royalties that were payable for the
prior calendar quarter, they look at the actual amount of royalties that were
paid to the Trust for that period and calculate the difference between what
was paid and what was payable.  Additional amounts payable by the operating
companies would be paid immediately and any overpayment would be deducted
from the payment for the first month of the following fiscal quarter.  In
March of the following calendar year, an average GBIP for the prior calendar

                                 - 19 -

year (weighted on a monthly basis by the respective volume of imported gas)
is published.  In September of each year, the operating companies make the
final determination of any necessary royalty adjustments for the prior
calendar year with a positive or negative adjustment made accordingly.
Currently, the Trust's German accountants review the royalty calculations on
a biennial basis.

          There are two types of natural gas found within the Oldenburg
concession, sweet gas and sour gas.  Sweet gas has little or no contaminants
and needs no treatment before it can be sold.  Sour gas, in comparison, must
be processed at the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant before it can be
sold.  The desulfurization process removes hydrogen sulfide and other
contaminants.  The hydrogen sulfide in gaseous form is converted to sulfur in
a solid form and sold separately. As needed, EMPG, the operator of the
Grossenkneten desulfurization plant, conducts maintenance on the plant,
generally during the summer months when demand is lower.  Historically, sour
gas production capacity during the period of maintenance work has been
reduced by approximately one-third.  There was no maintenance conducted
during 2016.  Maintenance was conducted from August 31, 2015 through October
13, 2015.  The operating companies have informed the Trust that, to promote
greater efficiency and cost effectiveness, the production capacity of
Grossenkneten will be reduced beginning in 2017.

          Under the Mobil and OEG Agreements, the gas is sold in one of three
ways: (1) directly on the spot market; (2) between Mobil Erdgas and BEB
(intra-company sales); or (3) directly to various distributors under
contracts (which delineate, among other provisions, the timing, manner,
volume and price of the gas sold).   While the operating companies will
continue to sell gas in one of these three ways, the impact of the respective
pricing involved is no longer applicable to the Trust because, under the
amended royalty agreements, the price point, which is used as part of the
basis for the royalty calculations, is now the average GBIP.

          The Trust's accountants in Germany have completed their examination
of the operating companies for 2013 and 2014 and all relevant adjustments
have been made to Trust royalties.  Their next examination for the 2015-2016
period will be performed under the amended royalty agreements and will likely
commence in November 2017.

          For unit owners, changes in the dollar value of the Euro have an
immediate impact.  This impact occurs at the time the royalties, which are
paid to the Trust in Euros, are converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable
exchange rate and transferred from Germany to the United States.  In relation
to the dollar, a stronger Euro would yield more dollars and a weaker Euro
would yield less dollars.

          Seasonal demand factors affect the income from the Trust's royalty
rights insofar as they relate to energy demands and increases or decreases in
prices, but on average they are generally not material to the annual income
received under the Trust's royalty rights.

- 20 -

          The Trust has no means of ensuring continued income from overriding
royalty rights at their present level or otherwise.  The Trust's consultant
in Germany provides general information to the Trust on the German and
European economies and energy markets.  This information provides a context
in which to evaluate the actions of the operating companies.  The Trust's
consultant receives reports from EMPG with respect to current and planned
drilling and exploration efforts.  However, EMPG and the operating companies
continue to limit the information flow to that which is required by German
law.

          The low level of administrative expenses of the Trust limits the
effect of inflation on costs.  Sustained price inflation would be reflected
in sales prices.  Sales prices along with sales volumes form the basis on
which the royalties paid to the Trust are computed.

Results:  Fiscal 2016 versus Fiscal 2015
----------------------------------------

          For fiscal 2016, the Trust's gross royalty income decreased 43.82%
to $6,960,961 from $12,390,575 in fiscal 2015 continuing to reflect the
disruption in the energy market and the uncertainty of the world economy.
The decrease in royalty income is due to declines in gas sales, gas prices
and average exchange rates under both royalty agreements.  The decrease in
the amount of royalty income resulted in the lower distributions.  The total
distribution for fiscal 2016 was $0.67 per unit compared to $1.27 per unit
for fiscal 2015.  As in prior years, the Trust receives adjustments from the
operating companies based on their final calculations of royalties payable
during the previous periods.  During fiscal 2016, the combination of positive
and negative adjustments reduced royalty income by $381,886, the equivalent
of $0.0416 per unit.  Due to the incorrect inclusion in prior years of
eastern sulfur sales in the royalty calculation under the Mobil Sulfur
Agreement, the combination of current year sulfur royalties and the negative
adjustment from prior years resulted in a net negative adjustment for fiscal
2016 of $51,576, the equivalent of $0.0056 per unit.  During fiscal 2015, the
combination of positive and negative adjustments reduced royalty income by
$592,626, the equivalent of $0.0645 per unit.  Due to the incorrect inclusion
in prior years of eastern sulfur sales in the royalty calculation under the
Mobil Sulfur Agreement, the combination of current year sulfur royalties and
the negative adjustment from prior years resulted in a net negative
adjustment for fiscal 2015 of $215,348, the equivalent of $0.0234 per unit.

          Gas sales under the Mobil Agreement declined 12.83% to 25.043
Billion cubic feet ("Bcf") in fiscal 2016 from 28.729 Bcf in fiscal 2015.
Gas sales in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 showed a decline from
the prior year's equivalent quarters.  However, gas sales in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2016 were higher than the prior year's equivalent quarter.
At least some of the increase in fourth quarter gas sales may be explained by
the partial shutdown of the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant for a
six-week period during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.  Since the Trust
does not receive information about the decision-making process of the
operating companies, it is impossible to determine to what extent, if any,
which factors may have impacted gas sales.  However, according to the Trust's
consultant in Germany, it is likely that some portion of the decline in gas
production is due to the normal reduction in well pressure that is
experienced over time.  The suspension of all drilling activities during the
2015-2016 period likely has also impacted gas sales.

Fiscal Year Avg.       1.1083              1.1323              -  2.12%

          Excluding the effects of differences in prices and average exchange
rates, the combination of royalty rates on gas sold from western Oldenburg
results in an effective royalty rate approximately seven times higher than
the royalty rate on gas sold from eastern Oldenburg.  This is of particular
significance to the Trust since gas sold from western Oldenburg provides the
bulk of royalties paid to the Trust.  For fiscal 2016, the volume of gas sold
from western Oldenburg accounted for only 32.43% of the volume of all gas
sales.  However, western Oldenburg gas royalties provided approximately
81.05% or $5,408,745 out of a total of $6,673,084 in overall Oldenburg gas
royalties.

          Gas sales under the OEG Agreement decreased 12.21% to 77.213 Bcf
in fiscal 2016 from 87.952 Bcf in fiscal 2015.  At least some portion of the

                                 - 22 -

decline in overall gas sales is likely a result of EMPG's decision to suspend
all drilling activities during 2015-2016.  Since the Trust does not receive
information about the decision-making process of the operating companies, it
is impossible to determine to what extent, if any, which factors may have
impacted gas sales.  However, according to the Trust's consultant in Germany,
it is likely that some portion of the decline in gas production is due to the
normal reduction in well pressure that is experienced over time.

Results:  Fiscal 2015 versus Fiscal 2014
----------------------------------------

          For fiscal 2015, the Trust's gross royalty income decreased 34.53%
to $12,390,575 from $18,927,005 in fiscal 2014 continuing to reflect the
disruption in the energy market and the uncertainty of the world economy.
The decrease in royalty income is due to declines in gas sales, gas prices
and average exchange rates under both royalty agreements.  The decrease in
the amount of royalty income resulted in the lower distributions.  The total
distribution for fiscal 2015 was $1.27 per unit compared to $1.95 per unit
for fiscal 2014.  As in prior years, the Trust receives adjustments from the
operating companies based on their final calculations of royalties payable
during the previous periods.  During fiscal 2015 the combination of positive
and negative adjustments reduced royalty income by $592,626, the equivalent
of $0.0645 per unit.  Due to the incorrect allocation in prior years of
eastern sulfur sales to royalty calculations under the Mobil Sulfur
Agreement, the combination of current year sulfur royalties and the negative
adjustment from prior years resulted in a net negative adjustment for fiscal
2015 of $215,348, the equivalent of $0.0234 per unit.  During fiscal 2014,
the negative adjustments decreased royalty income by $52,676, the equivalent
of $0.0057 per unit.

          Gas sales under the Mobil Agreement declined 7.84% to 28.729 Bcf
in fiscal 2015 from 31.172 Bcf in fiscal 2014.  A significant portion of this
decline occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter and was likely caused by
the partial shutdown of the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant for a
six-week period.  Since the Trust does not receive information about the
decision-making process of the operating companies, it is impossible to
determine to what extent, if any, which factors may have impacted gas sales.
However, according to the Trust's consultant in Germany, it is likely that
some portion of the decline in gas production is due to the normal reduction
in well pressure that is experienced over time.

          Excluding the effects of differences in prices and average exchange
rates, the combination of royalty rates on gas sold from western Oldenburg
results in an effective royalty rate approximately seven times higher than
the royalty rate on gas sold from eastern Oldenburg.  This is of particular
significance to the Trust since gas sold from western Oldenburg provides the
bulk of royalties paid to the Trust.  For fiscal 2015, the volume of gas sold
from western Oldenburg accounted for only 32.66% of the volume of all gas
sales.  However, western Oldenburg gas royalties provided approximately
79.32% or $9,289,836 out of a total of $11,711,215 in overall Oldenburg gas
royalties.

          Gas sales under the OEG Agreement decreased 9.47% to 87.952 Bcf in
fiscal 2015 from 97.155 Bcf in fiscal 2014.  A significant portion of this
decline occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter and was likely caused by
the partial shutdown of the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant for a six-
week period.  Since the Trust does not receive information about the
decision-making process of the operating companies, it is impossible to
determine to what extent, if any, which factors may have impacted gas sales.
However, according to the Trust's consultant in Germany, it is likely that
some portion of the decline in gas production is due to the normal reduction
in well pressure that is experienced over time.

          Interest income for fiscal 2015 decreased 49.59% to $9,439 as
compared to $18,724 for fiscal 2014 reflecting the reduction in royalty
receipts.  Trust expenses decreased 9.08% to $819,341 in fiscal 2015 from
$901,150 in fiscal 2014 primarily due to the absence of accounting costs
associated with the biennial examination of the royalty calculations by the
German operating companies and the reduction in Trustees fees as specified
according to the provisions of the Trust Agreement.

Report on Exploration and Drilling
----------------------------------

         The Trust's German consultant periodically contacts the
representatives of the operating companies to inquire about their planned and
proposed drilling and geophysical work and other general matters.  The
following represents a summary of the most recent information the Trust's
German consultant received from representatives of EMPG.  The Trust is not
able to confirm the accuracy of any of the information supplied by the
operating companies.  In addition, the operating companies are not required
to take any of the actions outlined and, if they change their plans with
respect to any such actions, they are not obligated to inform the Trust.

After having suspended all drilling activities for 2015
          and 2016 and with the continuing difficulties caused by
          low energy prices worldwide, EMPG has slowed the pace of

                                 - 26 -

          its future drilling program.  As recently as last spring,
          EMPG's drilling program provided for four wells to be
          drilled in 2017 followed by one well and one work-over
          in 2018, two wells in 2019 and one well in 2020.  The
          new program calls for one well and one work-over in 2017,
          three wells in 2018, two wells in 2019 and one well in
          2020.  Despite the lifting of the moratorium on fracking,
          no Carboniferous wells are listed in the drilling program
          through 2020.

          During 2016, EMPG performed work-overs of five eastern
          wells and one western well: Neerstedt Z-3, Doetlingen Z-12,
          Goldenstedt Z-13 and Z-20, Hengstlage T-14 and Kneheim Z-3
          (western). Workovers are conducted on older wells that for
          various reasons have experienced a drop in production due
          to a decline in pressure and can possibly benefit from
          further developmental efforts.  These reasons can include
          the presence of formation debris, bacterial infestation and
          formation water influx.

          The work-over scheduled for 2017 will be on Visbek Z-16a,
          a western Zechstein well.  Visbek Z-16a suffered a severe
          casing collapse six months after it began production and
          was shut down in October 2013.  While originally it was
          planned to drill a new coiled tubing sidetrack, the
          continuing low gas prices have made this choice uneconomical.
          Instead, this work-over will involve an attempt to repair
          the original casing.  The new well listed for 2017 is
          Hemmelte NW T-1 which is planned to develop a new area
          of the sweet gas Bunter zone in western Oldenburg.  This
          well was initially planned as a dual purpose well tapping
          both the Bunter and the deeper Zechstein zones but, due to
          technical difficulties, was scaled back.  A second well
          to access the Zechstein zone at a later date was initially
          mentioned but no further information has been forthcoming.

          The three new wells listed for 2018 are Brettorf Z-2b,
          Goldenstedt Z-12a M1 and Goldenstedt Z-25a M1.  All these
          wells are multilateral wells, are located in eastern
          Oldenburg and are sour gas infill wells.  Multilateral
          wells take advantage of a single master well to draw from
          multiple sidetracks.  The primary advantage is the cost
          saving in using a single borehole for more than one sidetrack.

          The two new wells listed for 2019 are Doetlingen Z-3A
          and Jeddeloh Z-1.  Doetlingen Z-3A is intended to develop
          the Zechstein zone in eastern Oldenburg.  Jeddeloh Z-1 is
          the first well being drilled in the Oldenburg concession
          with Vermilion as the lead developer.  The well is an
          exploration well tentatively located in the western portion
          of the area designated as Oldenburg-Land, the southernmost
          area of the three areas within the concession subject to
          Vermilion's Farm-In Agreement.  Vermilion's well is intended
          to develop the Rotliegend (Red Sandstone) formation, a
          previously undeveloped productive zone within the concession.
          Oldenburg-Land is a relatively undeveloped area of the
          concession compared to the southern area of Muensterland-
          Cloppenburg-Vechta where the majority of the wells
          operated by EMPG are located.
                                 - 27 -

          The single new well listed for 2020 is Alhorn Z-3, another
          sour gas well.  Alhorn Z-3 is intended to reopen the old
          Alhorn field, which had been plugged and abandoned in 1997.

          No firm dates have been announced for any of the wells
          described above.  Information on wells that are not named
          or are in preliminary planning stages is not divulged by EMPG.

Critical Accounting Policies
----------------------------

          The financial statements, appearing subsequently in this Report,
present financial statement balances and financial results on a modified cash
basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of accounting other than
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP basis").
Cash basis accounting is an accepted accounting method for royalty trusts
such as the Trust.  GAAP basis financial statements disclose income as earned
and expenses as incurred, without regard to receipts or payments.  The use of
GAAP would require the Trust to accrue for expected royalty payments.  This
is exceedingly difficult since the Trust has very limited information on such
payments until they are received and cannot accurately project such amounts.
The Trust's cash basis financial statements disclose revenue when cash is
received and expenses when cash is paid.  The one modification of the cash
basis of accounting is that the Trust accrues for distributions to be paid
to unit owners (those distributions approved by the Trustees for the Trust).
The Trust's distributable income represents royalty income received by the
Trust during the period plus interest income less any expenses incurred by
the Trust, all on a cash basis.  In the opinion of the Trustees, the use of
the modified cash basis provides a more meaningful presentation to unit
owners of the results of operations of the Trust and presents to the unit
owners a more accurate calculation of income and expenses for tax reporting
purposes.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
------------------------------

          The Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements.

Contractual Obligations
-----------------------

          As shown below, the Trust had no contractual obligations as of
October 31, 2016 other than the distribution announced on October 28, 2016
and payable to unit owners on November 30, 2016, as reflected in the
statement of assets, liabilities and trust corpus.

         This Report on Form 10-K may contain forward-looking statements
intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  Such statements address
future expectations and events or conditions concerning the Trust.  Many
of these statements are based on information provided to the Trust by the
operating companies or by consultants using public information sources.
These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could
cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in any
forward-looking statements.  These include:

-  risks and uncertainties concerning levels of gas production
             and gas sale prices, general economic conditions and currency
             exchange rates;
          -  the ability or willingness of the operating companies to
             perform under their contractual obligations with the Trust;
          -  potential disputes with the operating companies and the
             resolution thereof; and
          -  the risk factors set forth above under Item 1A of this Report.

          All such factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties
that may materially affect actual results, and are generally beyond the
control of the Trust.  New factors emerge from time to time and it is not
possible for the Trust to predict all such factors or to assess the impact
of each such factor on the Trust.  Any forward-looking statement speaks
only as of the date on which such statement is made, and the Trust does not
undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect
events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made.

Item 7A.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.
          ----------------------------------------------------------

          The Trust does not engage in any trading activities with respect to
possible foreign exchange fluctuations.  The Trust does not use any financial
instruments to hedge against possible risks related to foreign exchange
fluctuations.  The market risk with respect to funds held in the Trust's
bank account in Germany is negligible because standing instructions at
the Trust's German bank require the bank to process conversions and transfers
of royalty payments as soon as possible following their receipt.  The Trust
does not engage in any trading activities with respect to commodity price
fluctuations.

           REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and the Unit Owners of
North European Oil Royalty Trust

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets, liabilities and trust
corpus of North European Oil Royalty Trust (the "Trust") as of October 31,
2016 and 2015, and the related statements of revenue collected and expenses
paid, undistributed earnings, and changes in cash and cash equivalents for
each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2016.  These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Trust's management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require
that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement.  An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements.  An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 1, these financial statements have been prepared on the
modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of
accounting other than U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly,
in all material respects, the assets, liabilities and trust corpus of the
Trust as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, its revenue collected and expenses
paid, its undistributed earnings, and changes in its cash and cash
equivalents for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31,
2016, on the basis of accounting described in Note 1.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Trust's internal control over

                     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                     -----------------------------
                    OCTOBER 31, 2016, 2015 AND 2014
                    -------------------------------

(1) Summary of significant accounting policies:
    -------------------------------------------

      Basis of accounting -
      ---------------------

      The accompanying financial statements of North European Oil Royalty
Trust (the "Trust") are prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations
of the SEC.  Financial statement balances and financial results are presented
on a modified cash basis of accounting, which is a comprehensive basis of
accounting other than accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ("GAAP basis").  In the opinion of management, all adjustments that
are considered necessary for a fair presentation of these financial
statements, including adjustments of a normal, recurring nature, have been
included.

      On a modified cash basis, revenue is earned when cash is received and
expenses are incurred when cash is paid.  GAAP basis financial statements
disclose revenue as earned and expenses as incurred, without regard to
receipts or payments.  The modified cash basis of accounting is utilized to
permit the accrual for distributions to be paid to unit owners (those
distributions approved by the Trustees for the Trust).  The Trust's
distributable income represents royalty income received by the Trust during
the period plus interest income less any expenses incurred by the Trust, all
on a cash basis.  In the opinion of the Trustees, the use of the modified
cash basis of accounting provides a more meaningful presentation to unit
owners of the results of operations of the Trust.

Producing gas and oil royalty rights -
      --------------------------------------

      The rights to certain gas and oil royalties in Germany were transferred
to the Trust at their net book value by North European Oil Company (the
"Company") (see Note 2).  The net book value of the royalty rights has been
reduced to one dollar ($1) in view of the fact that the remaining net book
value of royalty rights is de minimis relative to annual royalties received
and distributed by the Trust and does not bear any meaningful relationship to
the fair value of such rights or the actual amount of proved producing
reserves.

Federal and state income taxes -
      --------------------------------

      The Trust, as a grantor trust, is exempt from federal income taxes
under a private letter ruling issued by the Internal Revenue Service.
The Trust has no state income tax obligations.

                                  F-6
                                 - 36 -

      Cash and cash equivalents -
      ---------------------------

      Cash and cash equivalents are defined as amounts deposited in bank
accounts and amounts invested in certificates of deposit and U. S. Treasury
bills with original maturities generally of three months or less from the
date of purchase.  The investment options available to the Trust are limited
in accordance with specific provisions of the Trust Agreement.  As of October
31, 2016, the uninsured amounts held in the Trust's U.S. bank accounts were
$906,704.  In addition, the Trust held 9,875 Euros, the equivalent of
$10,820, in its German bank account at October 31, 2016.

      Net income per unit -
      ---------------------

      Net income per unit is based upon the number of units outstanding at
the end of the period.  As of October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were
9,190,590 units of beneficial interest outstanding.

      New accounting pronouncements -
      -------------------------------

      The Trust is not aware of any recently issued, but not yet effective,
accounting standards that would be expected to have a significant impact on
the Trust's financial position or results of operations.

(2) Formation of the Trust:
    -----------------------

    The Trust was formed on September 10, 1975.  As of September 30, 1975,
the Company was liquidated and the remaining assets and liabilities of the
Company, including its royalty rights, were transferred to the Trust.  The
Trust, on behalf of the owners of beneficial interest in the Trust, holds
overriding royalty rights covering gas and oil production in certain
concessions or leases in the Federal Republic of Germany.  These rights are
held under contracts with local German exploration and development
subsidiaries of ExxonMobil Corp. and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of
Companies.  Under these contracts, the Trust receives various percentage
royalties on the proceeds of the sales of certain products from the areas
involved.  At the present time, royalties are received for sales of gas well
gas, oil well gas, crude oil, condensate and sulfur.

(3) Related party transactions:
    ---------------------------

    John R. Van Kirk, the Managing Director of the Trust, provides office
space and services to the Trust at cost.  For such office space and services,
the Trust reimbursed the Managing Director $28,559, $25,729 and $24,634 in
fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Lawrence A. Kobrin, a Trustee of the Trust, is a Senior Counsel at Cahill
Gordon & Reindel LLP, which serves as counsel to the Trust.  For legal
services, the Trust paid Cahill Gordon & Reindel LLP $80,405, $61,403 and
$57,512 in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

(4) Employee benefit plan:
    ----------------------

    The Trust has established a savings incentive match plan for employees
(SIMPLE IRA) that is available to both employees of the Trust, one of whom is
the Managing Director.  The Trustees authorized the making of contributions
by the Trust to the accounts of employees, on a matching basis, of up to 3%
of cash compensation paid to each such employee for the 2016, 2015 and 2014
calendar years.

Item 9A.  Controls and Procedures.

Disclosure Controls and Procedures
----------------------------------

          The Trust maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are
designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust is
recorded, processed, summarized, accumulated and communicated to its
management, which consists of the Managing Director, to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure, and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms.
The Managing Director has performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures as of
October 31, 2016.  Based on that evaluation, the Managing Director concluded
that the Trust's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
October 31, 2016.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting
-----------------------------------------

          Part A.  Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial
                   ------------------------------------------------------
                   Reporting
                   ---------

          The Trust's management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term
is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) for the Trust.  There are inherent
limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the
possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.
Accordingly, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable
assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because
of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over
time.  Management has evaluated the Trust's internal control over financial
reporting as of October 31, 2016.  This assessment was based on criteria for
effective internal control over financial reporting described in the
standards promulgated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and in
the Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Based on this
evaluation, management concluded that the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2016.  Management's
assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial

          REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Trustees and the Unit Owners
of North European Oil Royalty Trust

We have audited North European Oil Royalty Trust's (the "Trust") internal
control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2016, based on criteria
established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
The Trust's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Trust's internal control over
financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control
based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A trust's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  A trust's
internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of
the assets of the trust; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
and expenditures of the trust are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and trustees of the trust; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the trust's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

- 41 -

In our opinion, the Trust maintained, in all material respects, effective
internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2016, based on
criteria established in Internal Control Integrated Framework (2013) issued
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO).

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the statements of assets,
liabilities and trust corpus as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related
statements of revenue collected and expenses paid, undistributed earnings and
changes in cash and cash equivalents for each of the years in the three-year
period ended October 31, 2016 and our report dated December 29, 2016
expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Trustees:

     In accordance with the request of the Trustees of North European Oil
Royalty Trust ("Trustees"), the firm of Ralph E. Davis Associates, LLC
("Davis Associates") of Houston, Texas has performed the calculations
necessary to derive the cost depletion percentage for the 2016 calendar
year.  The cost depletion percentage was prepared for use by individual
unit owners of North European Oil Royalty Trust ("Trust") in their tax
preparations. In order to perform the calculation of the cost depletion
percentage we were further requested by the Trustees to prepare a report of
the estimated remaining proved producing reserves attributable to the
overriding royalty interests of the Trust in the Northwest German Basin of
the Federal Republic of Germany with an effective date of October 1, 2016.

     We have reviewed all available information with respect to 100% of the
Trust's proved developed properties utilized in the calculation of the cost
depletion percentage as discussed later in this report.  It is our opinion
that these properties represent all of the Trust's assets that may be
classified as proved for this purpose as per the Securities and Exchange
Commission directives as detailed later in this report.

     The reserves associated with this review have been classified in
accordance with the definitions of the Securities and Exchange Commission
as found in Part 210 Form and Content of and Requirements for Financial
Statements, Securities Act of 1933, Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, Investment Company Act of 1940,
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Energy Policy and Conservation Act of
1975, under Rules of General Application Section 210.4-10 Financial
accounting and reporting for oil and gas producing activities pursuant to the
Federal securities laws and the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975.

     The proved producing reserves are as of October 1, 2016 and the
reported sales are for the twelve month period ending September 30, 2016.
The use of the period ending September 30, 2016 is consistent with prior
years and allows the timely calculation of the royalty reserves and the cost
depletion percentage for the calendar year.  Throughout this report the unit

price used for crude oil, condensate, natural gas and sulfur is based upon
the appropriate price in effect for each of the twelve months during fiscal
2016 and averaged for the period.

     Based on the results of our calculation of estimated remaining proved
producing reserves contained in the first part of this report, we have
performed the calculations necessary to derive the cost depletion percentage
for the 2016 calendar year.  As detailed in Attachment B, the cost depletion
percentage for the 2016 calendar year for Trust unit owners is equal to
10.2769% of their cost base as of January 1, 2016.

DISCUSSION
----------

     The scope of this study was to review limited information we were able
to compile and to prepare an estimate of the proved producing reserves
attributable to the interests of the Trust from which the cost depletion
percentage could be calculated.  We prepared reserve estimates using
acceptable evaluation principles for each source.  These estimates were
based in large part on the limited information supplied by the operator of
the relevant properties.

     The quantities presented herein are estimated reserves of oil, natural
gas, natural gas liquids and sulfur that geologic and engineering data
demonstrate can be recovered from known reservoirs under current economic
conditions with reasonable certainty.

DESCRIPTION OF HOLDINGS
-----------------------

     The Trust holds various overriding royalty rights on sales of gas,
sulfur and oil from certain concessions and leases in the Federal Republic of
Germany.  The Oldenburg concession (1,386,000 acres), covering virtually the
entire former Grand Duchy of Oldenburg and located in the federal state of
Lower Saxony, is held by Oldenburgische Erdolgesellschaft ("OEG").  OEG in
turn is owned by Mobil Erdgas-Erdol GmbH ("Mobil Erdgas"), the German
subsidiary of ExxonMobil Corp. and by BEB Erdgas und Erdol GmbH ("BEB"), a
joint venture of ExxonMobil Corp. and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group of
Companies.  As a result by direct and indirect ownership, ExxonMobil Corp.
owns two-thirds of OEG and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group owns one-third of OEG.

     The Oldenburg concession is the major source of royalty income for the
Trust.  All proved producing reserves within the Oldenburg concession are
covered by this report.  Although the Trust has interests in other producing
areas, reserves and net sales for these areas are no longer used in the
calculation of the annual cost depletion percentage.   The exclusion of these
reserves does not have a material effect on the calculation of the cost
depletion percentage.  We will continue to monitor the quarterly statements

For the Calendar Year 2016

and, if increases are noted that could materially add reserves to the Trust,
we will resume estimating future reserves.

     In 2002 Mobil Erdgas and BEB formed a new company ExxonMobil Production
Deutschland GmbH to carry out all exploration, drilling and production within
the Oldenburg concession.  All sales activities are still handled by either
Mobil Erdgas or BEB.

          a)  Under one set of rights covering the western part of the
              Oldenburg concession (approximately 662,000 acres); the Trust
              receives a royalty payment of 4% on gross receipts from sales
              by Mobil Erdgas of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil and
              condensate ("Mobil Agreement"). Under the Mobil Agreement
              there is no deduction of costs prior to the calculation of
              royalties from gas well gas or oil well gas, which together
              account for approximately 99% of all the royalties under said
              agreement.

          b)  Under another series of rights covering the entire Oldenburg
              concession and pursuant to an agreement with OEG, the Trust
              receives royalties at the rate of 0.6667% on gross receipts
              from sales of gas well gas, oil well gas, crude oil,
              condensate and sulfur (removed during the processing of sour
              gas) less a certain allowed deduction of costs ("OEG
              Agreement").  Under the OEG Agreement, 50% of the field
              handling and treatment costs as reported for state royalty
              purposes are deducted from gross sales receipts prior to the
              calculation of the royalty to be paid to the Trust.  Sulfur is
              a by-product of gas production and is not considered in the
              computation of total cost depletion.

          c)  The Trust is also entitled to receive from Mobil Erdgas a 2%
              royalty payment on gross receipts from sales of sulfur obtained
              as a by-product of sour gas produced from the western part of
              Oldenburg. However, the payment of the sulfur royalty is
              provisional on whether Mobil Erdgas' selling price meets or
              exceeds the indexed base price.  The average selling price for
              sulfur exceeded the indexed base price since the start of
              fiscal 2012 except for the fourth calendar quarter of 2013.
              Sulfur is a by-product of gas production and is not considered
              in the computation of total cost depletion.

OLDENBURG AREA -  SALES AND RESERVES
------------------------------------

     The Trust's royalty income comes primarily from the Oldenburg area.  Gas
production accounts for the majority of the income; however, the hydrogen
sulfide in much of the gas produced necessitates its removal before the gas
can be sold. At the Grossenkneten desulfurization plant, the hydrogen sulfide
in sour gas is removed.  The plant's present input capacity stands at 620
million cubic feet ("MMcf") per day.  However, the operating companies have
informed the Trust that, to promote greater efficiency and cost
effectiveness, the production capacity of Grossenkneten will be reduced in
2017.

TOTAL SALES
                              -----------

     During the twelve months ending September 30, 2016, total sales for the
Oldenburg area were as follows:

     Estimated gross remaining proved producing reserves attributable to
the total Oldenburg area as of October 1, 2016 are as follows:

                                      WEST           EAST          TOTAL

                                NET RESERVES
                                ------------

     To present an accurate picture of estimated proved producing reserves
net to the Trust, the gross reserve figures outlined above must be modified
by the impact of the different royalty rates in effect in the Oldenburg
concession.  A comparison of the Trust's overriding royalty rates in both
the western and eastern areas of Oldenburg is as follows:

          Mobil Erdgas                  West          East
          ---------------            ----------    ----------
              Gas & Oil                  4%            0%
              Sulfur                     2%            0%

          BEB
          ---------------
              Gas & Oil               0.6667%(1)    0.6667%(1)
              Sulfur                  0.6667%(1)    0.6667%(1)

         (1) Prior to the calculation of royalties, 50% of costs as reported
             for state royalty purposes are deducted.

     The application of these royalty rates to the estimated gross remaining
proved producing reserves attributable to the western and eastern Oldenburg
areas yields the combined estimated proved producing reserves net to the
Trust.  The Trust's estimated remaining net proved producing reserves as of
October 1, 2016 and net sales for the twelve month period ending September
30, 2016 are as follows:

                                       Reserves         Sales
                                       --------         -----
          Gas Well Gas-MMcf             12,214          1,392
          Oil Well Gas-MMcf                 14              1
          Oil & Condensate-Barrels      33,371          4,225

history of net sales attributable to the royalty interests of the Trust are
presented in Attachment A.

LIMITATIONS OF AVAILABLE DATA
-----------------------------

     The reserves considered in this report are defined as proved producing
reserves.  Proved producing reserves are limited to those quantities which
can be expected to be recoverable commercially from known reservoirs at
current prices and costs, under existing regulatory practices and with
existing conventional equipment and operating methods.  Proved producing

For the Calendar Year 2016

reserves do not include either proved developed non-producing reserves or
any class of probable reserves.

     The estimate of reserves included in this report is based primarily upon
production history or analogy with wells in the area producing from the same
or similar formations.  In addition to individual well production history,
geological and well test information, when available, were utilized in the
evaluation.

     The reserves included in this report are estimates only and should not
be construed as being exact quantities.  The accuracy of the estimates is
dependent upon the quality of available data and upon the independent
geological and engineering interpretation of that data.  The quantities
presented herein are estimated reserves of hydrocarbons and produced products
that geologic and engineering data demonstrate can be recovered from known
reservoirs under current economic conditions with reasonable certainty.
Reserve estimates presented in this report are calculated using acceptable
methods and procedures and are believed to be appropriate and reasonable;
however, future reservoir performance may justify revision of these estimates.

     For the purpose of this report, estimated reserves are scheduled for
recovery primarily on the basis of actual producing rates or appropriate
well test information. They were prepared giving consideration to engineering
and geological data, anticipated producing mechanisms, the number and types
of completions, as well as past performance of analogous reservoirs.
Individual well production histories were analyzed and an appropriate daily
producing rate was utilized for each individual well in the preparation of a
forecast of future producing rates until an anticipated economic limit.

     The estimates of reserves and the forecasted rates of production may be
subject to regulation by various agencies, changes in market demand or other
factors. Consequently, the volumes of reserves recovered and the actual rates
of recovery may vary from the estimates included herein.

     The Trust, as an overriding royalty interest owner, does not receive
proprietary data from the various operators on producing wells.  Data, such
as logs, core analysis, reservoir tests, pressure tests, gas analyses,
geologic maps, and individual well production histories on all of the wells
which are used in volumetric and material balance type reserve estimates, are
not available to the Trust.  The lack of such data increases the inherent
uncertainties of our reserve estimate.

     The Trust receives quarterly statements from the operators that report
production, sales and revenue data.  Utilizing the same procedures as in
prior years, this information plus published information received from
W.E.G. (a German organization comparable to the American Petroleum Institute
or the American Gas Association) has been used to prepare this annual report.
In addition, the Trust retains a part-time consultant in Germany who is
familiar with the German petroleum industry in general and the operating

companies in particular.  His periodic reports and communications were
considered in the preparation of this report.

     We believe that reserve estimates prepared using all the available data
are appropriate and sufficient for the calculation of the cost depletion
percentage. However, due to the limitations of available data, this estimate
of reserves cannot have the same degree of accuracy that an estimate of
reserves prepared using all pertinent data would have.  Our experience in the
evaluation of reserves using such limited data, including twenty-five (25)
years of experience working for the Trust, compensates somewhat for the
limitations of available data.

     The data in the reports received by the Trust is in metric tons and cubic
meters.  The following Metric to English Unit conversion factors were used:

          Gas:     37.25 cubic feet per cubic meter at 14.7 psia
                   and 60 degrees Fahrenheit
          Oil:     7.23 barrels per metric ton
          Sulfur:  1.1 short tons per metric ton

CALCULATION OF COST DEPLETION PERCENTAGE
----------------------------------------

     The categories of proved producing reserves considered in the calculation
of the cost depletion percentage are oil, oil well gas, and gas well gas.
Sulfur is a by-product of gas production and is not considered in the
computation of total cost depletion percentage.

     For each category of reserves, a product base was established for the
Trust as of January 1, 1976.  Through the use of these product bases, we can
account for the relative size of each of these categories of reserves and
the corresponding impact on the calculation of the cost depletion percentage.
The product base for each category of proved producing reserves is reduced
annually by an adjustment that is calculated by multiplying the product base
at the beginning of the current year by the depletion factor for that
category of reserves.  The depletion factor for each category of reserves is
the ratio of the relevant net sales during the current year to the
corresponding adjusted net proved producing reserves at the beginning of the
current year.

     Significant items in the cost depletion percentage calculation that
appear on Attachment B as specific item numbers, shown in parentheses and
their sources are as follows:

          The adjusted estimated net proved producing reserves as of 10/1/15
          Line (3) is obtained by adding the estimated remaining net proved
          producing reserves as of 10/1/15 Line (1) and the adjustments to
          reserves during the period Line (2).  Therefore Line (3) =
          Line (1) + Line (2).

For the Calendar Year 2016

The depletion factor Line (6) for each category of proved producing
          reserves is obtained by dividing the relevant net sales Line (4) by
          the corresponding adjusted estimated net proved producing reserves
          as of 10/1/15 Line (3).  Therefore Line (6) = Line (4) / Line (3).

          The product base for each category of proved producing reserves as
          of 1/1/15 Line (7) and the adjustment taken during 2015 Line (8)
          were obtained from the previous year's report.  The product base as
          of 1/1/16 Line (9) forms the initial starting point for the
          calculation of the cost depletion percentage for the 2016 tax year.
          The product base for 1/1/16 Line (9) then is Line (7) - Line (8).

          The adjustment to the product base for each category of proved
          producing reserves Line (10) is used to reduce the product base as
          of the beginning of each year.  This adjustment is the product of
          the depletion factor for each category of proved producing reserves
          Line (6) multiplied by the corresponding product base as of 1/1/16
          Line (9).  Therefore Line (10) = Line (6) x Line (9).

          The cost depletion percentage Line (11) then is the sum of the
          adjustment to the product base of each category of proved producing
          reserves [Sum Line (10)] divided by the sum of the product base for
          each category as of 1/1/16 [Sum Line (9)].  Therefore Line (11) =
          [Sum Line (10)] / [Sum Line (9)].

The cost depletion percentage represents the total allowable cost
depletion for the 2016 calendar year for the Trust's unit owners, expressed
as a percentage of their cost base as of January 1, 2016.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION - DEFINITIONS OF RESERVES
       ------------------------------------------------------------

The following information is taken from the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission:

PART 210 FORM AND CONTENT OF AND REQUIREMENTS FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, PUBLIC UTILITY
HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935, INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940, INVESTMENT
ADVISERS ACT OF 1940, AND ENERGY POLICY AND CONSERVATION ACT OF 1975

Rules of General Application

   Section 210.4-10  Financial accounting and reporting for oil and gas
producing activities pursuant to the Federal securities laws and the Energy
Policy and Conservation Act of 1975.

Reserves
--------

Reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related
substances anticipated to be economically producible, as of a given date, by
application of development projects to known accumulations. In addition,
there must exist, or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will
exist, the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production,
installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market,
and all permits and financing required to implement the project.

Reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major,
potentially sealing, faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and
evaluated as economically producible. Reserves should not be assigned to
areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a
non-productive reservoir (i.e., absence of reservoir, structurally low
reservoir, or negative test results). Such areas may contain prospective
resources (i.e., potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered
accumulations).

Proved Oil and Gas Reserves
---------------------------

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which,
by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with
reasonable certainty to be economically producible-from a given date forward,
from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating
methods, and government regulations-prior to the time at which contracts
providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal
is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic
methods are used for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons

must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will
commence the project within a reasonable time.

   (i)   The area of the reservoir considered as proved includes:

        (A) The area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts,
            if any, and

        (B) Adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can, with
            reasonable certainty, be judged to be continuous with it and to
            contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of
            available geoscience and engineering data.

   (ii) In the absence of data on fluid contacts, proved quantities in a
reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons (LKH) as seen in a
well penetration unless geoscience, engineering, or performance data and
reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty.

   (iii) Where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a
highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential exists for an associated
gas cap, proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher
portions of the reservoir only if geoscience, engineering, or performance
data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable
certainty.

   (iv)  Reserves which can be produced economically through application of
improved recovery techniques (including, but not limited to, fluid injection)
are included in the proved classification when:

        (A) Successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir
            with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a
            whole, the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or
            an analogous reservoir, or other evidence using reliable
            technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the
            engineering analysis on which the project or program was based;
            and

        (B) The project has been approved for development by all necessary
            parties and entities, including governmental entities.

   (v)  Existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which
economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined. The price shall
be the average price during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of
the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic
average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period,
unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements, excluding escalations
based upon future conditions.

Reasonable Certainty.  If deterministic methods are used, reasonable
certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be
recovered. If probabilistic methods are used, there should be at least a 90%
probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the
estimate. A high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more
likely to be achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability
of geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and
economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time,
reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant
than to decrease.

Reliable Technology.  Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more
technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and
has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency
and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous
formation.

Probable Reserves
-----------------

Probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be
recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are
as likely as not to be recovered.

   (i)  When deterministic methods are used, it is as likely as not that
actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved
plus probable reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there should be
at least a 50% probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal
or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates.

   (ii) Probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to
proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are
less certain, even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or
productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion. Probable
reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the
proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir.

   (iii) Probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental
quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons
in place than assumed for proved reserves.

For the Calendar Year 2016

Possible Reserves
-----------------

Possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be
recovered than probable reserves.

   (i)  When deterministic methods are used, the total quantities ultimately
recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus
probable plus possible reserves. When probabilistic methods are used, there
should be at least a 10% probability that the total quantities ultimately
recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible
reserves estimates.

   (ii)  Possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent
to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data
are progressively less certain. Frequently, this will be in areas where
geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and
vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined
project.

   (iii) Possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated
with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the
recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves.

   (iv)  The proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible
reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and
commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are
clearly documented, including comparisons to results in successful similar
projects.

   (v)   Possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering
data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same
accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with
displacement less than formation thickness or other geological
discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore, and the
registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the
known (proved) reservoir. Possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are
structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in
communication with the proved reservoir.

   (vi)  Pursuant to paragraph (a)(22)(iii) of this section, where direct
observation has defined a highest known oil (HKO) elevation and the potential
exists for an associated gas cap, proved oil reserves should be assigned in
the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the HKO only if the
higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable
technology. Portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable
certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based
on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations.

Developed Oil and Gas Reserves
------------------------------

Developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be
expected to be recovered:

   (i) Through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods
or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared
to the cost of a new well; and

   (ii) Through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational
at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not
involving a well.

Undeveloped Oil and Gas Reserves
--------------------------------

Undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are
expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from
existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for
recompletion.

   (i)   Reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly
offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of
production when drilled, unless evidence using reliable technology exists
that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater
distances.

   (ii)  Undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves
only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are
scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless the specific circumstances,
justify a longer time.

   (iii) Under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be
attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or
other improved recovery technique is contemplated, unless such techniques
have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an
analogous reservoir, as defined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or by
other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty.

Additional Definitions:

Deterministic Estimate
----------------------

The method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a
single value for each parameter (from the geoscience, engineering, or
economic data) in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation
procedure.

For the Calendar Year 2016

Probabilistic Estimate
----------------------

The method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic
when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown
parameter (from the geoscience and engineering data) is used to generate a
full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of
occurrence.

Reasonable Certainty
--------------------

If deterministic methods are used, reasonable certainty means a high degree
of confidence that the quantities will be recovered. If probabilistic
methods are used, there should be at least a 90% probability that the
quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. A high
degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be
achieved than not, and, as changes due to increased availability of
geoscience (geological, geophysical, and geochemical), engineering, and
economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) with time,
reasonably certain EUR is much more likely to increase or remain constant
than to decrease.
