  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, all references to "Black Knight," "us," "we" or "our" are to Black Knight Financial Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries. 
    
           (1) 
    Basis of Presentation 
     The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), and all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited), as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on February 26, 2016. 
  Prior period amounts related to the Legal and regulatory accrual and Accrued interest on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited) have been reclassified to Trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities in order to conform to the current period presentation. 
  Description of Business 
  Black Knight is a holding company that conducts business through our sole managing member interest in Black Knight Financial Services, LLC ("BKFS LLC"). Through its subsidiaries, BKFS LLC is a leading provider of integrated technology, workflow automation and data and analytics to the mortgage and real estate industries. Our solutions facilitate and automate many of the mission-critical business processes across the entire mortgage loan life cycle, from origination until asset disposition. We believe we differentiate ourselves by the breadth and depth of our comprehensive, integrated solutions and the insight we provide to our clients.  
  We are a majority-owned subsidiary of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. ("FNF"). Our business generally represents a reorganization of the former Technology, Data and Analytics segment of Lender Processing Services, Inc. ("LPS"), a former provider of integrated technology, data and services to the mortgage lending industry in the United States that FNF acquired in January 2014. Our business also includes two companies that were contributed to us by FNF: Fidelity National Commerce Velocity, LLC and Property Insight, LLC. ServiceLink Holdings, LLC ("ServiceLink"), another majority-owned subsidiary of FNF, operates the Transaction Services businesses of the former LPS as well as FNF s legacy ServiceLink businesses.  
  Reporting Segments 
  We conduct our operations through   two   reporting segments: (1) Technology and (2) Data and Analytics. See further discussion in Note 12     Segment Information  .   
  Consolidation 
  BKFS LLC is subject to the consolidation guidance related to variable interest entities as set forth in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 810,   Consolidation   ("ASC 810"). Black Knight, as the sole managing member of BKFS LLC, has the exclusive authority to manage, control and operate the business and affairs of BKFS LLC and its subsidiaries, pursuant to the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement ("LLC Agreement"). Under the terms of the LLC Agreement, Black Knight is authorized to manage the business of BKFS LLC, including the authority to enter into contracts, manage bank accounts, hire employees and agents, incur and pay debts and expenses, merge or consolidate with other entities and pay taxes. Because Black Knight is the primary beneficiary through its sole managing member interest and possesses the rights established in the LLC Agreement, in accordance with the requirements of ASC 810, Black Knight controls BKFS LLC and appropriately consolidates the operations thereof.  
  We account for noncontrolling interests in accordance with ASC 810. Our Class A shareholders indirectly control BKFS LLC through our managing member interest. Our Class B shareholders have a noncontrolling interest in BKFS LLC. Their share of equity in BKFS LLC is reflected in Noncontrolling interests in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited), and their share of net earnings or loss in BKFS LLC is reported in Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Earnings (Unaudited). Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests do not include expenses incurred directly by Black Knight, including income tax expense attributable to Black Knight.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) - (Continued) 

All earnings prior to the closing of our initial public offering ("IPO") on May 26, 2015 have been disclosed as Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents include the following (in millions): 

_______________ 
  (1) Restricted cash equivalents relate to our subsidiary, I-Net Reinsurance Limited, and are held in trust until the final reinsurance policy is canceled.  
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
  Trade receivables, net includes an allowance for doubtful accounts of   $2.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Capital Lease  
  On June 29, 2016, Black Knight entered into a   one  -year capital lease agreement with a bargain purchase option for certain computer equipment. The leased equipment has a useful life of   five   years and will be depreciated on a straight-line basis over this period. The leased equipment was valued based on the net present value of the minimum lease payments, which was   $10.0 million   (net of imputed interest of   $0.1 million  ) and is included in Property and equipment, net on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited). The remaining capital lease obligation of   $8.4 million   is included in Trade accounts payable and other accrued liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (Unaudited). This transaction is a non-cash investing and financing activity. 
  Total minimum lease payments as of   September 30, 2016   for the remainder of 2016 and 2017 are as follows (in millions): 

Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Earnings (Unaudited) include the following (in millions):

Deferred contract costs amortization for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes accelerated amortization of   $2.9 million   related to certain deferred implementation costs. 
  Transition and Integration Costs 
  Transition and integration costs during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily represent costs related to business acquisitions. See further discussion in Note 2     Business Acquisitions  . Transition and integration costs during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily represent management fees paid to FNF and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. ("THL"), and costs related to the IPO. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  Revenue Recognition (Topic 606) 
  In May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this update simplify the transition and clarify certain aspects of the revenue standard.  
  Also in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11,   Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  . The SEC Staff is rescinding certain SEC Staff Observer comments that are codified in ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , and ASC Topic 932,   Extractive Activities-Oil and Gas  , effective upon adoption of ASC Topic 606,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASC 606 ). Specifically, registrants should not rely on the SEC Staff Observer comments upon adoption of ASC 606 related to revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process, accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs, accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer and accounting for gas-balancing arrangements.  
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.   This guidance clarifies how to determine whether goods and services are separately identifiable and thus accounted for as separate performance obligations. Additionally, this update clarifies how to evaluate the nature of a promise in granting a license of intellectual property, which determines whether to recognize revenue over time or at a point in time.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).   This new standard requires a company to determine whether it is a principal (that controls the promised good or service before transferring it to the customer) or an agent (that arranges for another entity to provide the goods or services). Principals are required to recognize revenue equal to the gross amount of consideration exchanged for the promised good or service. Agents are required to recognize revenue net of any fees or commissions paid for arranging the promised good or service to be provided by another party.  
  The ASUs listed above are effective on adoption of ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating which transition approach to use and assessing the effect the adoption of these ASUs will have on our results of operations and our financial position. 
  Other Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The amendments in this ASU introduce clarifications to the presentation of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The primary updates include additions and clarifications of the classification of cash flows related to certain debt repayment activities, contingent consideration payments related to business combinations, proceeds from insurance policies, distributions from equity method investees and cash flows related to securitized receivables. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including in interim periods. This ASU requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented upon adoption. We do not expect this update to have a material effect on our statement of cash flows. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments     Credit Losses  . This guidance significantly changes how companies measure and recognize credit impairment for many financial assets. The new Current Expected Credit Loss Model will require companies to immediately recognize an estimate of credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of the financial assets included in the scope of this standard, which include trade receivables. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for annual and

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) - (Continued) 

interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. We do not expect this update to have a material effect on our results of operations or our financial position. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . Under the new guidance, companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and certain tax deficiencies related to share-based awards in additional paid-in capital. Instead, income tax effects of awards will be recorded in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also will allow an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statements should be applied prospectively. Amendments related to minimum statutory withholding requirements and forfeitures should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. The guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. We do not expect this update to have a material effect on our results of operations or our financial position. 
   
  (2)    Business Acquisitions 
  We include the results of operations of acquired businesses beginning on the respective acquisition dates. The purchase price is allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Measurement period adjustments to provisional purchase price allocations are recognized in the period in which they are determined, with the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income resulting from such changes calculated as if the accounting had been completed on the acquisition date. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , Black Knight completed the acquisitions of eLynx Holdings, Inc. ("eLynx") and Motivity Solutions, Inc. ("Motivity"). Neither acquisition meets the definition of "significant" pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation S-X ( 210.3-05) either individually or in the aggregate. Further, the individual and aggregate results of operations are not material to Black Knight's financial statements. Further details on each acquisition are discussed below. 
  Allocation of Purchase Price 
  The fair value of the acquired Computer software and Other intangible assets for both transactions was determined using a preliminary third-party valuation based on significant estimates and assumptions, including Level 3 inputs, which are judgmental in nature. These estimates and assumptions include the projected timing and amount of future cash flows, discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in the future cash flows and future market prices. These estimates are preliminary and subject to adjustments as we complete our valuation process with respect to capitalized software, other intangible assets and goodwill. The fair value of the remaining assets acquired and liabilities assumed approximate their carrying values, and therefore, no fair value adjustments are reflected in these amounts.  
  eLynx 
  On May 16, 2016, Black Knight completed its acquisition of eLynx, a leading lending document and data delivery platform. eLynx helps clients in the financial services and real estate industries electronically capture and manage documents and associated data throughout the document lifecycle. Black Knight purchased eLynx to augment its origination technologies. This acquisition positions Black Knight to electronically support the full mortgage origination process. 
  Total consideration paid, net of cash received, was   $115.0 million   for   100%   of the equity interests of eLynx. Additionally, Black Knight incurred direct transaction costs of   $0.4 million   and   $1.2 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, that are included in Transition and integration costs on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Earnings (Unaudited). The total consideration paid was as follows (in millions):

Motivity 
  On June 22, 2016, Black Knight completed its acquisition of Motivity, which provides customized mortgage business intelligence software solutions. Motivity will be integrated with Black Knight's LoanSphere product suite, including the LoanSphere Data Hub, to provide clients with deeper insights into their origination and servicing operations and portfolios. 
  Total consideration paid, net of cash received, was   $35.2 million   for   100%   of the equity interests of Motivity. Additionally, Black Knight incurred direct transaction costs of   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, that are included in Transition and integration costs on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Earnings and Comprehensive Earnings (Unaudited).

Estimated Useful Lives of Property and Equipment, Computer Software and Other Intangible Assets Acquired 
  As of the respective acquisition dates, the gross carrying value and weighted average estimated useful lives of Property and equipment, Computer software and Other intangible assets acquired in the above acquisitions consisted of the following (dollars in millions): 

(3)    Earnings Per Share 
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing Net earnings attributable to Black Knight by the weighted-average number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding during the period.  
  For the periods presented, potentially dilutive securities include unvested restricted stock awards and the shares of Class B common stock that are convertible on a   one  -for-one basis into shares of our Class A common stock. However, the   84.8 million   shares of Class B common shares have been excluded in computing diluted net earnings per share because including them on an "if-converted" basis would have an anti-dilutive effect. Diluted net earnings per share is calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Black Knight by the weighted-average diluted number of shares of Class A common stock outstanding. The denominator includes the dilutive effect of approximately   2.0 million   and   3.3 million   shares of unvested restricted shares of Class A common stock for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, and approximately   1.9 million   and   3.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the period from May 26, 2015 through September 30, 2015, respectively. 
    
  The shares of Class B common stock do not share in the earnings or losses of Black Knight and are, therefore, not participating securities. Accordingly, basic and diluted net earnings per share of Class B common stock have not been presented.

  THL affiliates held   $39.5 million   and   $39.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, of principal amount of our Term Loan B (as defined in Note 8     Long-Term Debt  ) from our credit agreement dated May 27, 2015.

  Credit Agreement 
  On May 27, 2015, our indirect subsidiary, Black Knight InfoServ, LLC ("BKIS"), entered into a credit and guaranty agreement (the "Credit Agreement") with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, the guarantors party thereto and the other agents and lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for (i) an   $800.0 million   term loan A facility (the "Term A Loan"), (ii) a   $400.0 million   term loan B facility (the "Term B Loan") and (iii) a   $400.0 million   revolving credit facility (the "Revolving Credit Facility", and collectively with the Term A Loan and Term B Loan, the "Facilities"). The Term A Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility mature on May 27, 2020, and the Term B Loan matures on May 27, 2022. The Facilities are guaranteed by substantially all of BKIS's wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries and BKFS LLC, and are secured by associated collateral agreements that pledge a lien on virtually all of BKIS's assets, including fixed assets and intangible assets, and the assets of the guarantors.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Term A Loan and the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Eurodollar rate plus a margin of   200   basis points, and the Term B Loan bears interest at the Eurodollar rate plus a margin of   300   basis points, subject to a Eurodollar rate floor of   75   basis points. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have   $350.0 million   capacity on the Revolving Credit Facility and pay an unused commitment fee of   30   basis points. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Black Knight borrowed   $55.0 million   on our Revolving Credit Facility, all of which was related to the eLynx and Motivity acquisitions. See further discussion in Note 2     Business Acquisitions.   We made payments of   $105.0 million   on this facility during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rates on the Term A Loan, Term B Loan and Revolving Credit Facility were   2.56%  ,   3.75%   and   2.56%  , respectively. 
  Senior Notes 
  BKIS has   5.75%   Senior Notes, interest paid semi-annually, which mature on April 15, 2023 (the "Senior Notes"). The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations, registered under the Securities Act and contain customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants, and events of default for indebtedness of this type (with grace periods, as applicable, and lender remedies).

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) - (Continued) 

Prior to October 15, 2017, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes by paying a "make-whole" premium based on U.S. Treasury rates. On or after October 15, 2017, we may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at the redemption prices listed in the table below, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if a change of control occurs, we are required to offer to purchase all outstanding Senior Notes at a price equal to   101%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date of purchase. 

Fair Value of Long-Term Debt 
  The fair value of our Senior Notes as of   September 30, 2016   was   $410.5 million   (  105.25%   of par value), based upon established market prices for the securities using level 2 inputs. The fair value of our Facilities approximates their carrying value at   September 30, 2016  . The fair value of our Facilities is based upon established market prices for the securities using level 2 inputs. 
  Interest Rate Swaps 
  On January 20, 2016, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge forecasted monthly interest rate payments on   $400.0 million   of our floating rate debt (  $200.0 million   notional value each) (the "Swap Agreements"). Under the terms of the Swap Agreements, we receive payments based on the 1-month LIBOR rate (equal to 0  .5625%   as of   September 30, 2016  ) and pay a weighted average fixed rate of   1.01%  . The effective term for the Swap Agreements is February 1, 2016 through January 31, 2019. 
   We entered into the Swap Agreements to convert a portion of the interest rate exposure on our floating rate debt from variable to fixed. We designated these Swap Agreements as cash flow hedges. A portion of the amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into Interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the Term A Loan. The fair value of our Swap Agreements is based upon level 2 inputs. We have considered our own credit risk when determining the fair value of our Swap Agreements.  
  The estimated fair values of our Swap Agreements are as follows (in millions):     

As of   September 30, 2016  , a cumulative loss of   $0.8 million   (  $0.5 million   net of tax) is reflected in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, and a cumulative loss of   $0.8 million   is reflected in Noncontrolling interests. Below is a summary of the effect of derivative instruments on amounts recognized in other comprehensive earnings ("OCE") on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Earnings (Unaudited) for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (in millions): 

Approximately   $1.1 million   (  $0.9 million   net of tax) of the balance in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and noncontrolling interests as of   September 30, 2016   is expected to be reclassified into Interest expense over the next 12 months.

  BLACK KNIGHT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) - (Continued) 

It is our policy to execute such instruments with credit-worthy banks and not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe our interest rate swap counterparties will be able to fulfill their obligations under our agreements, and we believe we will have debt outstanding through the various expiration dates of the swaps such that the occurrence of future cash flow hedges remains probable. 
   
  (9)        Income Taxes 
  For the period prior to the IPO, substantially all of the income taxes of BKFS LLC were not reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) as the responsibility for payment of income taxes was borne by the members of BKFS LLC and not by us. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no uncertain tax positions. We record interest and penalties related to income taxes, if any, as a component of Income tax expense. Our effective tax rate for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   16.3%   and   18.1%  , respectively, and   16.3%   and   11.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These rates are lower than the typical federal and state statutory rate because of the effect of our noncontrolling interests. 
   
  (10)        Commitments and Contingencies 
  In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various pending and threatened litigation and regulatory matters related to our operations, some of which include claims for punitive or exemplary damages. Our ordinary course litigation includes purported class action lawsuits, which make allegations related to various aspects of our business. From time to time, we also receive requests for information from various state and federal regulatory authorities, some of which take the form of civil investigative demands or subpoenas. Some of these regulatory inquiries may result in the assessment of fines for violations of regulations or settlements with such authorities requiring a variety of remedies. We believe that no actions, other than those discussed below, depart from customary litigation or regulatory inquiries incidental to our business. 
  We review lawsuits and other legal and regulatory matters (collectively  legal proceedings ) on an ongoing basis when making accrual and disclosure decisions. When assessing reasonably possible and probable outcomes, management bases its decision on its assessment of the ultimate outcome assuming all appeals have been exhausted. For legal proceedings where it has been determined that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable, a liability based on known facts and which represents our best estimate has been recorded. Actual losses may materially differ from the amounts recorded and the ultimate outcome of our pending cases is generally not yet determinable. The accrual for legal and regulatory matters, which includes expenses incurred through the balance sheet date, was   $3.5 million   and   $8.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. While some of these matters could be material to our operating results or cash flows for any particular period if an unfavorable outcome results, at present we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of currently pending legal proceedings, either individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. 
  Litigation Matters 
  On December 16, 2013, LPS received notice that Merion Capital, L.P. and Merion Capital II, L.P. (together "Merion Capital") were asserting their appraisal right relative to their ownership of   5,682,276   shares of LPS stock (the  Appraisal Shares ) in connection with the acquisition of LPS by FNF on January 2, 2014. On February 6, 2014, Merion Capital filed an appraisal proceeding, captioned   Merion Capital LP and Merion Capital II, LP v. Lender Processing Services, Inc.,   C.A. No. 9320-VCL, in the Delaware Court of Chancery seeking a judicial determination of the "fair" value of Merion Capital's   5,682,276   shares of LPS common stock under Delaware law, together with statutory interest. We filed an answer to this suit on March 3, 2014. Merion s expert has opined that the consideration should have been   $50.46   per share, which is approximately   36 percent   higher than the final consideration of   $37.14  , and therefore, they are owed an additional   $75.7 million   plus statutory interest, which is approximately   $13.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . Black Knight s position is that no additional consideration is owed. A bench trial was held May 2 through May 5, 2016, and post-trial arguments were held on September 21, 2016. We will continue to vigorously defend against the appraisal proceedings, and we do not believe the result will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.   
  Regulatory Matters 
  Following a review by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision (collectively, the "banking agencies"), LPS entered into a consent order (the "Order") dated April 13, 2011 with the banking agencies. The banking agencies' review of LPS's services included the services provided by its default operations to mortgage servicers regulated by the banking agencies, including document execution services. The Order did not make any findings of fact or conclusions of wrongdoing, nor did LPS admit any fault or liability. Although LPS is a party to the Order, the ongoing costs of litigation and any potential resulting liability is expected  
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  
    
  BLACK KNIGHT FINANCIAL SERVICES, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited) - (Continued) 

to be borne by the underlying LPS default operations, which are now part of ServiceLink. Under the Order, ServiceLink agreed to further study the issues identified in the review and to enhance ServiceLink's compliance, internal audit, risk management and board oversight plans with respect to those businesses. LPS also agreed to engage an independent third party to conduct a risk assessment and review of its default management businesses and document execution services it provided to mortgage servicers from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2010, which has been on hold since June 2013.  
  To the extent such third party review, once completed, requires additional remediation of mortgage documents, ServiceLink has agreed to implement an appropriate plan to address the issues. The Order does not include any fine or other monetary penalty. The banking agencies notified ServiceLink in December 2015 that they wish to discuss terminating the Order through a possible agreed civil monetary penalty amount in lieu of requiring any additional document execution review by the independent third party. At this time, the parties have not agreed on a possible civil monetary penalty amount. The parties entered into a tolling agreement to allow the parties to engage in these discussions.  
  This matter is subject to a Cross-Indemnity Agreement between BKFS LLC and ServiceLink (see   Indemnification Agreement   below). 
  Indemnifications and Warranties  
  We often agree to indemnify our clients against damages and costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright, trademark infringement or breaches of confidentiality associated with use of our software through software licensing agreements. Historically, we have not made any payments under such indemnifications, but continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications to identify whether a loss has occurred that is both probable and estimable that would require recognition. In addition, we warrant to clients that our software operates substantially in accordance with the software specifications. Historically, no costs have been incurred related to software warranties and none are expected in the future, and as such, no accruals for warranty costs have been made.  
  Indemnification Agreement 
  We are party to the Cross-Indemnity Agreement with ServiceLink. Pursuant to this agreement, ServiceLink indemnifies us from liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from the conduct of ServiceLink's business or any action, suit or proceeding in which we or any of our subsidiaries are named by reason of being a successor to the business of LPS and the cause of such action, suit or proceeding relates to the business of ServiceLink. In return, we indemnify ServiceLink for liabilities relating to, arising out of, or resulting from the conduct of our business. 
   
  (11)        Equity-Based Compensation 
  On February 3, 2016, we granted approximately   0.8   million restricted shares of our Class A common stock with a grant date fair value of   $28.29   per share, which was based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The vesting for these shares is based on certain operating performance and service criteria. Of the   0.8   million restricted shares granted,   0.2   million restricted shares vest over a   three  -year period, and   0.6   million restricted shares vest over a   four  -year period.  
  Restricted stock transactions in 2016 are as follows (shares in millions): 

______________________________ 
           * 
    The BKFS LLC profits interest units that were converted into restricted shares in connection with our IPO had a weighted average grant date fair value of   $2.10   per unit. The fair value of the restricted shares at the date of conversion, May 20, 2015, was   $24.50   per share. The original grant date fair value of the vested restricted shares, which were originally granted as profits interests units, was   $2.01   per unit.

Equity-based compensation expense was   $3.4 million   and   $0.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $9.5 million   and   $10.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These expenses are included in Operating expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Comprehensive Earnings (Unaudited). Equity-based compensation expense for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   includes an acceleration charge of   $6.2 million   related to the accelerated vesting of   4.4 million   restricted shares of Class A common stock in connection with the IPO. 
  Total unrecognized compensation cost was   $28.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   2.7   years. 
   
  (12)    Segment Information 
  ASC Topic 280,   Segment Reporting   ("ASC 280")     establishes standards for reporting information about segments and requires that a public business enterprise reports financial and descriptive information about its segments. Segments are components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and are evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ( CODM ) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Black Knight s president and chief executive officer is identified as the CODM as defined by ASC 280. To align with the internal management of our business operations based on service offerings, our business is organized into   two   segments:  
             
    Technology -   offers software and hosting solutions that support loan servicing, loan origination and settlement services.   
                
    Data and Analytics -   offers data and analytics solutions to the mortgage, real estate and capital markets industries. These solutions include property ownership data, lien data, servicing data, automated valuation models, collateral risk scores, prepayment and default models, lead generation and other data solutions.  
     Separate discrete financial information is available for these two segments and the operating results of each segment are regularly evaluated by the CODM in order to assess performance and allocate resources. We use EBITDA as the primary profitability measure for making decisions regarding ongoing operations. EBITDA is earnings before Interest expense, Income tax expense and the Depreciation and amortization of Property and equipment, Computer software, Other intangible assets and deferred contract costs. We do not allocate Interest expense, Other expense, net, Income tax expense and certain other items, such as purchase accounting adjustments and acquisition-related costs to the segments, since these items are not considered in evaluating the segments' overall operating performance.  
  Summarized financial information concerning our segments is shown in the tables below (in millions). Prior period results have been reclassified to conform to the current segment presentation. We have reclassified purchase accounting adjustments from the Technology and Data and Analytics segments to Corporate and Other to provide a better indication of ongoing segment performance.

  The statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that are not purely historical are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, including statements regarding expectations, hopes, intentions or strategies regarding the future. Forward-looking statements are based on Black Knight management's beliefs, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, them. Because such statements are based on expectations as to future financial and operating results and are not statements of fact, actual results may differ materially from those projected. Black Knight Financial Services, Inc. (  "Black Knight," "us," "we" or "our"  ) undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The risks and uncertainties that forward-looking statements are subject to include, but are not limited to: electronic security breaches against our information systems; our ability to maintain and grow our relationships with our customers; changes to the laws, rules and regulations that affect our and our customers' businesses; our ability to adapt our services to changes in technology or the marketplace; the effect of any potential defects, development delays, installation difficulties or system failures on our business and reputation; changes in general economic, business, regulatory and political conditions, particularly as they effect the mortgage industry; risks associated with the availability of data; the effects of our substantial leverage on our ability to make acquisitions and invest in our business; risks associated with our structure and status as a "controlled company"; our ability to successfully integrate strategic acquisitions; and other risks detailed in the "Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information," "Risk Factors" and other sections of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). 
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016. 
  History 
  Black Knight is a holding company that conducts our business through our interest in Black Knight Financial Services, LLC ("BKFS LLC"). Through its subsidiaries, BKFS LLC is a leading provider of integrated technology, workflow automation and data and analytics to the mortgage and real estate industries. Our solutions facilitate and automate many of the mission-critical business processes across the entire mortgage loan life cycle, from origination until asset disposition. We believe we differentiate ourselves by the breadth and depth of our comprehensive, integrated solutions and the insight we provide to our clients.  
  We are a majority-owned subsidiary of Fidelity National Financial, Inc. ("FNF"). Our business generally represents a reorganization of the former Technology, Data and Analytics segment of Lender Processing Services, Inc. ("LPS"), a former provider of integrated technology, data and services to the mortgage lending industry in the United States that FNF acquired in January 2014. Our business also includes the businesses of Fidelity National Commerce Velocity, LLC and Property Insight, LLC, two companies that were contributed to us by FNF.

  Overview  
  We have market-leading positions in mortgage processing and technology solutions combined with comprehensive real estate data and extensive analytic capabilities. Our solutions are utilized by U.S. mortgage originators and mortgage servicers, as well as other financial institutions, investors and real estate professionals, to support mortgage lending and servicing operations, analyze portfolios and properties, operate more efficiently, meet regulatory compliance requirements and mitigate risk.  
  The U.S. mortgage market is undergoing significant change, and mortgage market participants have been subjected to more stringent oversight in recent years. Regulators have increasingly focused on better disclosure, improved risk mitigation and enhanced oversight. Mortgage lenders large and small have experienced higher costs in order to comply with this higher level of regulation. Despite these new regulatory burdens, the mortgage industry remains a competitive marketplace with numerous large lenders and smaller institutions competing for new loan originations. In order to comply with this increased regulatory burden and compete more effectively, mortgage market participants have continued to outsource mission-critical functions to third party technology providers that can offer comprehensive and integrated solutions, which are also cost-effective, due to their deep domain expertise and economies of scale. 
  We believe our comprehensive end-to-end, integrated solutions differentiate us from other technology providers serving the mortgage industry and position us particularly well for evolving opportunities in this market. We have served the mortgage and real estate industries for over 50 years and utilize this experience to design and develop solutions that fit our clients  ever-evolving needs. Our proprietary technology platforms and data and analytics capabilities reduce manual processes, improve compliance and quality, mitigate risk and deliver significant cost savings to our clients. Our scale allows us to continually and cost-effectively invest in our business in order to meet evolving industry requirements and maintain our position as an industry-standard platform for mortgage market participants. We had   32.3 million   and   30.7 million   active loans on our mortgage servicing platform on

September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Based on the total number of U.S. first lien mortgages outstanding on   September 30, 2016  , according to the Black Knight Mortgage Monitor Report, our proprietary technology platform is used to service approximately   61%   of all U.S. first lien mortgages, reflecting our leadership in technology for the mortgage servicing market. 
  Our business is organized into two segments:  
     Technology     -     offers software and hosting solutions that support loan servicing, loan origination and settlement services.  
             
    Data and Analytics     -     offers data and analytics solutions to the mortgage, real estate and capital markets industries. These solutions include property ownership data, lien data, servicing data, automated valuation models, collateral risk scores, prepayment and default models, lead generation and other data solutions.  
     We offer our solutions to a wide range of clients across the mortgage industry. The quality and breadth of our solutions contributes to the long-standing nature of our relationships with our clients, the majority of whom enter into long-term contracts across multiple products that are embedded in their mission critical workflow and decision processes. Given the contractual nature of our revenues and stickiness of our client relationships, our revenues are highly visible and recurring in nature. Due to our integrated suite of solutions and our scale in the mortgage market, we are able to drive significant operating leverage, which we believe enables our clients to operate more efficiently while allowing us to generate strong margins and cash flow.  
  Business Trends and Conditions 
  General  
  The U.S. mortgage market is large, and the loan life cycle is complex and consists of several stages. The mortgage loan life cycle includes origination, servicing and default. Mortgages are originated through home purchases or refinancing of existing mortgages. Once a mortgage is originated, it is serviced on a periodic basis by mortgage servicers, which may not be the lenders that originated the mortgage. Furthermore, if a mortgage experiences default, it triggers a set of multifaceted processes with an assortment of potential outcomes depending on a mix of variables.  
  Underlying the three major components of the mortgage loan life cycle is the technology, data and analytics support behind each process, which has become increasingly critical to industry participants due to the complexity of regulatory requirements. As the industry has grown in complexity, participants have responded by outsourcing to large scale specialty providers, automating manual processes and seeking end-to-end solutions that support the processes required to manage the entire mortgage loan life cycle.  
  The U.S. mortgage market has seen significant change over the past few years and is expected to continue to evolve going forward. Key regulatory actions arising from the recent financial crisis, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act ("Dodd-Frank Act") and the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), impose new and evolving standards for market participants. These regulatory changes have spurred lenders and servicers to seek technology solutions that facilitate the meeting of compliance obligations in the face of a changing regulatory environment while remaining efficient and profitable.  
             
    Increased regulation  . Most U.S. mortgage market participants have become subject to increasing regulatory oversight and regulatory requirements as federal and state governments have enacted various new laws, rules and regulations. One example of such legislation is the Dodd-Frank Act, which contains broad changes for many sectors of the financial services and lending industries and established the CFPB, a new federal regulatory agency responsible for regulating consumer financial protection within the United States. It is our experience that mortgage lenders have become more focused on minimizing the risk of non-compliance with these evolving regulations and are looking toward technologies and solutions that help them comply with the increased regulatory oversight and burdens. The CFPB final rules became effective October 2015, amending Regulation Z (the Truth in Lending Act) ("TILA") and Regulation X (Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act) ("RESPA") (the  TILA-RESPA Rule ) to consolidate existing loan disclosures under TILA and RESPA for closed-end credit transactions secured by real property. The TILA-RESPA Rule requires (i) timely delivery of a loan estimate upon receipt of a consumer s application and (ii) timely delivery of a closing disclosure prior to consummation of a transaction. The TILA-RESPA Rule also imposes certain restrictions, including the prohibition of imposing fees prior to provision of an estimate and the prohibition of providing estimates prior to a consumer s submission of verifying documents.    
                
    Lenders increasingly focused on core operations.   As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny and the higher cost of doing business, we believe lenders have become more focused on their core operations and customers. We believe lenders are increasingly shifting from in-house technologies to solutions with third-party providers who can provide better technology and services more efficiently. Lenders require these vendors to provide best-in-class technology and deep domain expertise and to assist them in maintaining regulatory compliance.

Growing role of technology in the U.S. mortgage industry.   Banks and other lenders and servicers have become increasingly focused on technology automation and workflow management to operate more efficiently and meet their regulatory guidelines. We believe vendors must be able to support the complexity of the market, display extensive industry knowledge and possess the financial resources to make the necessary investments in technology to support lenders.   
                
    Increased demand for enhanced transparency and analytic insight  . As U.S. mortgage market participants work to minimize the risk in lending, servicing and capital markets, they rely on the integration of data and analytics with technologies that enhance the decision making process. These industry participants rely on large comprehensive third party databases coupled with enhanced analytics to achieve these goals.  
     Mortgage Originations  
  Our various businesses are affected differently by the level of mortgage originations, including refinancing transactions. Our mortgage servicing platform is less affected by varying levels of mortgage originations because it earns revenues based on the total number of mortgage loans it processes, which tend to stay more constant than the market for originations. Our origination technology and some of our data businesses are directly affected by the volume of real estate transactions and mortgage originations, but many of our client contracts for origination technology contain minimum charges. 
  Economic Conditions  
  Our various businesses are also affected by general economic conditions. For example, in the event that a difficult economy or other factors lead to a decline in levels of home ownership and a reduction in the number of mortgage loans outstanding and we are not able to counter the effect of those events with increased market share or higher fees, it could have a material adverse effect on our mortgage processing revenues. In contrast, we believe that a weaker economy tends to increase the volume of consumer mortgage defaults, which can increase the revenues in our specialty servicing technology business that is used to service residential mortgage loans in default. Also, interest rates tend to decline in a weaker economy driving higher than normal refinance transactions that provide potential volume increases to our origination technology offerings, most specifically the RealEC Exchange platform. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Key Performance Metrics 
  We use Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful for investors in evaluating our overall financial performances. Black Knight believes these measures provide useful information about operating results, enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and future prospects and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and operational decision making, including determining a portion of executive compensation.  
             
    Adjusted Revenues   - We define Adjusted Revenues as Revenues adjusted to include the revenues that were not recorded by Black Knight during the periods presented due to the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment recorded in accordance with GAAP. These adjustments are reflected in Corporate and Other.  
                
    Adjusted EBITDA   - We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net earnings from continuing operations, with adjustments to reflect the addition or elimination of certain income statement items including, but not limited to (i) depreciation and amortization; (ii) interest expense; (iii) income tax expense; (iv) the deferred revenue purchase accounting adjustment recorded in accordance with GAAP; (v) equity-based compensation; (vi) charges associated with significant legal and regulatory matters; (vii) member management fees paid to FNF and THL Managers, LLC; (viii) exit costs, impairments and other charges; (ix) costs associated with debt and equity offerings; (x) acquisition-related costs; and (xi) other expenses, net. These adjustments are reflected in Corporate and Other.  
                
    Adjusted EBITDA Margin   - Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by Adjusted Revenues.

In addition, we would need cash to purchase shares of Class B common stock that are converted into shares of Class A common stock pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement if we choose to pay cash for such shares.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $58.9 million   and debt of   $1,580.5 million  , excluding the debt issuance costs and the unamortized premium associated with our 5.75% Senior Notes maturing on April 15, 2023 ("Senior Notes"). We believe our cash flow from operations and available cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs, including the repayment of our outstanding debt, for at least the next 12 months. We anticipate that to the extent that we require additional liquidity, it will be funded through borrowings on our revolving credit facility, the incurrence of other indebtedness, equity issuance or a combination thereof. We cannot be assured that we will be able to obtain this additional liquidity on reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of the largest lender on our revolving credit facility would reduce our borrowing capacity by   $36.7 million  . Additionally, our liquidity and our ability to meet our obligations and fund our capital requirements are also dependent on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot be assured that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available from additional indebtedness or otherwise to meet our liquidity needs. Although we have no specific current plans to do so, if we decide to pursue one or more significant acquisitions, we may incur additional debt or sell additional equity to finance such acquisitions.

Cash Flows  
  The following table provides a summary of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented (in millions):  

Operating Activities  
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $210.5 million   and   $158.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   The increase   in cash provided by operating activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   2015   period is primarily related to increased earnings. 
  Investing Activities  
  Cash used in investing activities was   $206.1 million   and   $81.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   The increase   in cash used in investing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   2015   period is primarily related to the eLynx and Motivity acquisitions that were partially offset by lower capital expenditures in the 2016 period and a one-time investment in our property records database from the buyout of a strategic data partner in the   2015   period. 
  Financing Activities  
  Cash used in financing activities was   $131.5 million   and   $10.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The   2016   period includes debt service payments of   $138.0 million   and tax distributions to BKFS LLC members of   $48.5 million  , partially offset by cash inflows of   $55.0 million   in borrowings. In the   2015   period, we had cash inflows of   $1,299.0 million   in borrowings, net of original discount, and   $479.3 million   in gross proceeds from the IPO. These inflows were offset primarily by   $1,734.9 million   in debt service payments, as well as debt issuance costs and other costs attributable to the IPO. 
  Financing  
  For a description of our financing arrangements, see Note 8     Long-Term Debt   in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) included in Item 1 of Part 1 of this Report, which is incorporated by reference into this Part I Item 2. 
  Contractual Obligations  
  Our long-term contractual obligations generally include our debt and related interest payments, data processing and maintenance commitments and operating and capital lease payments on certain of our property and equipment. In June 2016, we entered into a one-year capital lease agreement with a bargain purchase option for certain computer equipment. 
  Total minimum lease payments as of   September 30, 2016   for the capital lease agreement for the remainder of 2016 and 2017 are as follows (in millions): 

There were no other significant changes to contractual obligations from those disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Indemnifications and Warranties  
  We often indemnify our clients against damages and costs resulting from claims of patent, copyright, trademark infringement or breaches of confidentiality associated with use of our software through software licensing agreements. Historically, we have not made any payments under such indemnifications, but continue to monitor the conditions that are subject to the indemnifications

to identify whether a loss has occurred that is both probable and estimable that would require recognition. In addition, we warrant to clients that our software operates substantially in accordance with the software specifications. Historically, no costs have been incurred related to software warranties and none are expected in the future, and as such no accruals for warranty costs have been made.  
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
  We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases and interest rate swaps.  
  Critical Accounting Policies  
  There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
  Market Risk 
  We regularly assess market risks and have established policies and business practices designed to protect against the adverse effects of these exposures.     We are exposed to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates. We use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk. We do not use interest rate swaps for trading purposes, to generate income or to engage in speculative activity.  
  Interest Rate Risk 
  In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by operating activities, we use fixed rate and variable rate debt to finance our operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations and related interest rate swaps. We had   $1,580.5 million   in long-term debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . The Senior Notes represent all of our fixed-rate long-term debt obligations as of   September 30, 2016  . The carrying value of the Senior Notes was   $401.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The fair value of the Senior Notes was   $410.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  The credit facilities as described in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) represent our variable rate long-term debt obligations as of   September 30, 2016  . The carrying value of these facilities was   $1,179.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . We performed a sensitivity analysis on the principal amount of our long-term debt subject to variable interest rates as of   September 30, 2016  . This sensitivity analysis is based solely on the principal amount of such debt as of   September 30, 2016  , and does not take into account any changes that occurred in the prior 12 months or that may take place in the next 12 months in the amount of our outstanding debt or in the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps. Further, in this sensitivity analysis, the change in interest rates is assumed to be applicable for an entire year. An increase of 100 basis points in the applicable interest rate would cause an increase in interest expense of   $11.2 million   on an annual basis (  $7.2 million   including the effect of our current interest rate swaps). A decrease of 100 basis points in the applicable rate would cause a decrease in interest expense of   $4.5 million   on an annual basis (  $2.3 million   including the effect of our current interest rate swaps) as the current LIBOR rate is   less than 1%  . 
  On January 20, 2016, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to hedge forecasted monthly interest rate payments on   $400.0 million   of our floating rate debt ($200.0 million notional value each) (the  Swap Agreements ). The Swap Agreements were designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Under the terms of the Swap Agreements, we receive payments based on the 1-month LIBOR rate and pay a weighted average fixed rate of   1.01%  . A portion of the amount included in accumulated other comprehensive earnings is reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment as interest payments are made on the term and revolving loans. In accordance with the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements, the inputs used to determine the estimated fair value of our interest rate swaps are Level 2-type measurements. We considered our own credit risk and the credit risk of the counterparties when determining the fair value of our interest rate swaps. The effective term for the Swap Agreements is February 1, 2016 through January 31, 2019.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , under the supervision and with the participation of our President and Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
  There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  
  Based on that evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit with the SEC are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
  There     was no change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 10.1 
  Amendment 
  to the 
  Restricted Stock Award Agreement 
  (Subject to Time-Based Restriction) 
    
  This AMENDMENT (the    Amendment   ), effective as of August 19, 2016, is by and between Black Knight Financial Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    Company   ), and [   ] (the  Grantee ).  
    
                WHEREAS, the Grantee was previously granted an award (the    Award   ) of  restricted shares of the Company s Class A common stock on May 26, 2015, in exchange for the Grantee s profits interest award of Class B Units in Black Knight Financial Services, LLC granted to Grantee on [   ], 2014; and 
    
                WHEREAS, the Company and the Executive wish to amend the Restricted Stock Award Agreement, pursuant to which the Award was granted (the    Award Agreement    
    
                NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be bound, the parties hereby agree as follows.  

1.      Section 2(a)(i) of the Award Agreement is amended to read as follows: 
      If the Grantee s (A) employment or service as a Director or Consultant is terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary without Cause or (B) employment agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary provides for severance benefits upon a termination for  Good Reason  and the Grantee terminates employment for Good Reason in accordance with the employment agreement, then any Shares of Restricted Stock that would have vested within the 12 months immediately following the date of the Grantee s termination (had the Grantee s employment or services not terminated) shall vest as of the date of termination.  Except as otherwise provided in the previous sentence, if the Grantee s employment or service as a Director or Consultant is terminated by the Company or Grantee for any reason, including as a result of the Grantee s death or Disability, the Grantee shall, for no consideration, forfeit to the Company the Shares of Restricted Stock to the extent such Shares are subject to a Period of Restriction at the time of such termination.  
  2.    A new Section (iv) shall be added after Section 2(a)(iii) to read as follows: 
   (iv)    The term  Disability  shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in the Grantee s employment, director services or similar agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary.  If the Grantee s employment, director services or similar agreement does not define the term  Disability,  or if the Grantee has not entered into an employment, director services or similar agreement with the Company or a Subsidiary, the term  Disability  shall mean a total or permanent disability of Grantee that would entitle the Grantee to long-term disability benefits under the Company s or a Subsidiary s long-term disability plan in which Grantee is eligible to participate.    
    
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Company and the Grantee have caused this Amendment to be duly executed, effective as of the date first set forth above.
