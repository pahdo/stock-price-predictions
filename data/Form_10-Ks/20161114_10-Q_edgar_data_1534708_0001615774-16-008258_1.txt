1.    Description of Business and Liquidity    

Eastside Distilling,
Inc. (the  Company  or  Eastside ) was formed in 2008 and is a manufacturer, developer, producer, and marketer
of hand-crafted spirits in the following beverage alcohol categories: bourbon, whiskey, rum, and vodka. The Company currently distributes
its products in 22 states (California, New York, Florida, Texas, Illinois, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington)
and is authorized to distribute its products in the province of Ontario, Canada. The Company also generates revenue from tastings,
tasting room tours, private parties, and merchandise sales from its facilities in Oregon. The Company is subject to the Oregon
Liquor Control Commission (OLCC) and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB). The Company is headquartered in Portland,
Oregon. 

The results for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 referred to in these condensed consolidated financial statements include the results of Eastside s
wholly-owned subsidiary Michael Williams Web Design Inc. of New York, NY ( MWWD ) (through February 3, 2015). 

2.    Going Concern  

Our financial statements have
been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred a loss of $3,797,988 and have an accumulated deficit of $11,359,739
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and expect to incur further losses in the development of our business. We have been
dependent on funding operations through the issuance of debt, convertible debt and private sale of equity securities. These conditions
raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans include continuing to finance
operations through the private or public placement of debt and/or equity securities and the reduction of expenses. The financial
statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company completed equity and debt financings totaling approximately $3.9 million in net cash proceeds.
Management believes that its successful efforts to raise capital and increases in revenues will provide the opportunity for the
Company to continue as a going concern. The Company's ultimate success depends on its ability to achieve profitable operations
and generate positive cash flow from operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve profitable operations
or raise additional capital or financing at acceptable terms. 

3.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis of Presentation and Consolidation    

The accompanying unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements for Eastside Distilling, Inc. and Subsidiary were prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information and with instructions for
Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not include all disclosures necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, results
of operations, and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. However, all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary
for a fair presentation of the interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been included. All such adjustments are
of a normal recurring nature. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. The unaudited condensed consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not
necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The condensed
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Eastside Distilling, Inc. s wholly-owned subsidiary MWWD (through
February 3, 2015). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Financial Statements

Segment Reporting  

The Company determined its operating
segment on the same basis that it uses to evaluate its performance internally. The Company has one business activity, marketing
and distributing hand-crafted spirits, and operates as one segment. The Company's chief operating decision makers, its chief executive
officer and chief financial officer, review the Company's operating results on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources
and evaluating financial performance. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company records revenue when
all four of the following criteria are met: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of the
products and/or services has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured. 

The Company recognizes sales
when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to wholesale customers (except in the case of a consignment sale). For consignment
sales, the Company recognizes sales upon the consignee s shipment to the customer. Postage and handling charges billed to
customers are also recognized as sales upon shipment of the related merchandise. Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point,
and title passes to the customer at the time and place of shipment or purchase by customers at a retail location. The customer
has no cancellation privileges after shipment or upon purchase at retail locations, other than customary rights of return. The
Company excludes sales tax collected and remitted to various states from sales and cost of sales. Sales from items sold through
the Company s retail locations are recognized at the time of sale. 

Revenue received from online
merchants who sell discounted gift certificates for the Company's merchandise and tastings is deferred until the customer has
redeemed the discounted gift certificate or the gift certificate has expired, whichever occurs earlier. 

Cost of Sales  

Cost of sales consists of the
costs of ingredients utilized in the production of spirits, manufacturing labor and overhead, warehousing rent, packaging, and
in-bound freight charges. Ingredients account for the largest portion of the cost of sales, followed by contract production fees
and packaging. 

Shipping and Fulfillment Costs  

Freight costs incurred related
to shipment of merchandise from the Company s distribution facilities to customers are recorded in cost of sales. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Cash equivalents are considered
to be highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of the purchase. The Company had no cash equivalents
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

Concentrations  

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of trade receivables. At September 30, 2016 and 2015,
two distributors accounted for trade receivables greater than 10% of the total trade receivables at an aggregate of 77% and 85%,
respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, sales to three distributors exceeded 10% of the total consolidated
revenues at an aggregate of 57%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, sales to one distributor exceeded 10% of the total
consolidated revenues at 35%. 

Fair Value Measurements  

GAAP defines fair value, establishes a framework for
measuring fair value, and requires certain disclosures about fair value measurements. GAAP permits an entity to choose to measure
many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value and contains financial statement presentation and disclosure
requirements for assets and liabilities for which the fair value option is elected. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
management has not elected to report any of the Company's assets or liabilities at fair value under the  fair value option 
provided by GAAP. 

The hierarchy of fair value valuation
techniques under GAAP provides for three levels: Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3, if
applicable, generally would require significant management judgment. The three levels for categorizing assets and liabilities
under GAAP's fair value measurement requirements are as follows: 

Level 1:  
      Fair value of the asset or liability is determined
    using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2:  
      Fair value of the asset
    or liability is determined using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the applicable asset or liability,
    either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or liabilities in active
    markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.   

Level 3:  
      Fair value of the asset
    or liability is determined using unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement and reflect management's
    own assumptions regarding the applicable asset or liability.   

None of the Company's assets
or liabilities were measured at fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. However, GAAP requires the disclosure
of fair value information about financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. Financial instruments consist principally
of trade receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, note payable, and convertible note payable. The estimated fair value
of trade receivables, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximates their carrying value due to the short period of time
to their maturities. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s note payable and convertible notes payable
are at fixed rates and their carrying value approximates fair value. 

Inventories  

Inventories primarily consist
of bulk and bottled liquor and merchandise and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using an average
costing methodology, which approximates cost under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. A portion of inventory is held by the
OLCC on consignment until it is sold to a third party. The Company regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand and records
write-downs for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on the Company s estimated forecast of product demand and
production requirements. Such write-downs establish a new cost basis of accounting for the related inventory. The Company has
recorded no write-downs of inventory for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment is stated
at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the assets, ranging from two to seven years. Amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight-line
method over the life of the lease or the useful lives of the assets, whichever is shorter. The cost and related accumulated depreciation
and amortization of property and equipment sold or otherwise disposed of are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is
reported as current period income or expense. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 

Long-lived Assets  

The Company accounts for long-lived
assets, including property and equipment, at amortized cost. Management reviews long-lived assets for probable impairment whenever
events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If there is an indication of
impairment, management would prepare an estimate of future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) expected to
result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. If these estimated cash flows were less than the carrying amount
of the asset, an impairment loss would be recognized to write down the asset to its estimated fair value. 

Income Taxes  

The provision for income taxes
is based on income and expenses as reported for financial statement purposes using the  asset and liability method 
for accounting for deferred taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the
deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. As changes in tax laws or rates are enacted, deferred
tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred
tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company established valuation
allowances against its net deferred tax assets. 

Income tax positions that meet
the  more-likely-than-not  recognition threshold are measured at the largest amount of income tax benefit that is more
than 50 percent likely to be realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated
with income tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above would be reflected as a liability for unrecognized
income tax benefits in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets along with any associated interest and penalties that would
be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits
would be classified as additional income taxes in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations. There were
no unrecognized income tax benefits, nor any interest and penalties associated with unrecognized income tax benefits, accrued
or expensed at and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The Company files federal income
tax returns in the U.S. and various state income tax returns. The Company is no longer subject to examinations by the related
tax authorities for the Company's U.S. federal and state income tax returns for years prior to 2012 and 2011, respectively. 

Advertising  

Advertising costs are expensed
as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $170,000 and $240,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements
of operations.

Comprehensive Income  

Comprehensive (loss) income consists
of net (loss) income and other comprehensive income. The Company does not have any reconciling other comprehensive income items
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Excise Taxes  

The Company is responsible for
compliance with the TTB regulations, which includes making timely and accurate excise tax payments. The Company is subject to
periodic compliance audits by the TTB. Individual states also impose excise taxes on alcohol beverages in varying amounts. The
Company calculates its excise tax expense based upon units produced and on its understanding of the applicable excise tax laws. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company recognizes as
compensation expense all stock-based awards issued to employees. The compensation cost is measured based on the grant-date fair
value of the related stock-based awards and is recognized over the service period of stock-based awards, which is generally the
same as the vesting period. The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which estimates
the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on a variety of assumptions including expected stock price volatility,
expected terms of the awards, risk-free interest rate, and dividend rates, if applicable. Stock-based awards issued to nonemployees
are recorded at fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic market adjustments at the end of each reporting
period and as the underlying stock-based awards vest. 

Accounts Receivable Factoring Program  

During 2016, we utilized a receivable factoring program
to help improve our liquidity. Under the program, we have the option to sell customer receivables in advance of payment for 75%
of the amount due. When the customer remits payment, we then receive the remaining 25%. We are charged interest on the advanced
75% payment at a rate of 2.15% per month. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we factored invoices totaling $560,172
and received total proceeds of $420,129. At September 30, 2016, we had $184,875 in open factored invoices. We incurred interest
expense associated with the factoring program of $21,500 during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. Comparatively,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we factored invoices totaling $94,293 and received total proceeds of $70,720.
At September 30, 2015, we had $27,560 in open factored invoices. We incurred interest expense associated with the factoring program
of $1,085 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standard Boards (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09,  Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ), which simplifies several aspects of the accounting
for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding
requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not plan to early adopt. We are currently
evaluating the impact ASU 2015-11 will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued AUS No. 2016-02  Leases
(Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of
short-term leases) at the commencement date: 

-  A lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make
                                         lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and

 (unaudited) 

-  A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the
                                         lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term.   

Under the new guidance, lessor
accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the
lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The new lease guidance simplified the accounting
for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. Lessees will no
longer be provided with a source of off-balance sheet financing. Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2019,
for a calendar year entity). Early application is permitted for all public business entities upon issuance. Lessees (for capital
and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective
transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in
the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired
before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. We
are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( ASU 2014-09 ) amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring
more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of
revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2016. The Company does not plan to early adopt. We are currently evaluating the impact ASU 2014-09 will have on the Company's
condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern ( ASU 2014-15 ). The new guidance explicitly requires
that management assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and may require additional detailed disclosures. ASU
2014-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Though
permitted, the Company does not plan to early adopt. The Company does not believe that this standard will have a significant impact
on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-11, simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11 ), which requires entities to measure most inventory
at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary
course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Though permitted, the Company does not plan to early adopt. We are
currently evaluating the impact ASU 2015-11 will have on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued
ASU 2015-03, simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized
debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. ASU 2015-03
is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and early application is permitted. We have early
adopted as of December 31, 2015.

8  Income Taxes 

The provision for income taxes
results in effective tax rates which are different than the federal income tax statutory rate. The nature of the differences for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: 

The components of the net
deferred tax assets and liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following: 

At September
30, 2016, the Company had a cumulative net operating loss carryforward (NOL) of approximately $7.5 million, to offset against future
income for federal and state tax purposes. These federal and state NOLs can be carried forward for 20 and 15 years, respectively.
The federal NOLs begin to expire in 2034, and the state NOLs begin to expire in 2029. 

In assessing
the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generation of
future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Due to the uncertainty of the
realizability of the deferred tax assets, management has determined a full valuation allowance is appropriate.

9.  Commitments and Contingencies 

Operating Leases  

The Company
leases its warehouse, kiosks, and tasting room space under operating lease agreements, which expire through October 2020. Monthly
lease payments range from $1,300 to $24,000 over the terms of the leases. For operating leases which contain fixed escalations
in rental payments, the Company records the total rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The difference between
the expense computed on a straight-line basis and actual payments for rent represents deferred rent which is included within accrued
liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Retail spaces under lease are subject to monthly percentage rent
adjustments when gross sales exceed certain minimums. 

At September
30, 2016, future minimum lease payments required under the operating leases were approximately as follows: 

Total rent expense was approximately
$304,000 and $290,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Legal Matters  

The Company
is involved in certain legal matters arising from the ordinary course of business. Management does not believe that the outcome
of these matters will have a significant effect on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. 

10.  Net Loss per Common Share 

Basic loss per common share is
computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period, without considering
any dilutive items. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the sum of the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding and the potential number of any dilutive common shares outstanding during the period. Potentially
dilutive securities consist of the incremental common stock issuable upon exercise of stock options and convertible notes. Potentially
dilutive securities are excluded from the computation if their effective is anti-dilutive. There were no dilutive common shares
outstanding at September 30, 2016 and 2015. The numerators and denominators used in computing basic and diluted net loss per common
share in 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

In January 2016, the Company issued 10,050 shares of common stock to employees for stock-based compensation
of $54,270. Additionally, the Company had $154,707 of stock-based compensation expense related to stock options granted to employees

Issuance
of Convertible Preferred Stock 

From
April 4, 2016 to June 17, 2016, the Company sold 972 shares of its series A convertible preferred stock ( Series A Preferred )
for an aggregate purchase price of $972,000, of which (i) 499 Units were purchased for $499,000 in cash (ii) 423 Units were purchased
by certain of our officers in consideration of $423,000 accrued and unpaid salary and (iii) 50 Units were purchased in consideration
of cancellation of $50,000 of outstanding indebtedness net of issuance costs of $35,920.  

Each
share of Series A Convertible Preferred has a stated value of $1,000, which is convertible into shares of the Company s
common stock (the  Common Stock ) at a fixed conversion price equal to $1.50 per share. The Series A Convertible Preferred
accrue dividends at a rate of 8% per annum, cumulative. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears at the Company s option
either in cash or  in kind  in shares of Common Stock; provided, however that dividends may only be paid in cash following
the fiscal year in which the Company has net income (as shown in its audited financial statements contained in its Annual Report
on Form 10-K for such year) of at least $500,000, to the extent permitted under applicable law out of funds legally available
therefore. For  in-kind  dividends, holders will receive that number of shares of Common Stock equal to (i) the amount
of the dividend payment due such stockholder divided by (ii) 90% of the average of the per share market values during the twenty
(20) trading days immediately preceding a dividend date.  

In
the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or sale of the Company, each holder of Series
A Preferred shall be entitled to receive its pro rata portion of an aggregate payment equal to: (i) $1,000 multiplied by (ii)
the total number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued under the Series A Certificate of Designation multiplied by (iii)
2.5.  

For
all matters submitted to a vote of the Company s stockholders, the holders of the Series A Preferred as a class shall have
an aggregate number of votes equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock (rounded to the nearest whole number)
into which the total shares of Series A Preferred Stock issued under the Series A Certificate of Designation on such date of determination
are convertible multiplied by (y) 2.5 (the  Total Series A Votes ), with each holder of Series A Preferred entitled
to vote its pro rata portion of the Total Series A Votes. Holders of Common Stock do not have cumulative voting rights. In addition,
the holders of Series A Preferred shall vote separately a class to change any of the rights, preferences and privileges of the
Series A Preferred.  

Beneficial conversion
feature 

The
Company evaluated the convertible note and determined that a portion of the note should be allocated to additional paid-in capital
as a beneficial conversion feature, since the conversion price on the note as of March 10, 2016 was set at a discount to the fair
market value of the underlying stock. As a result, a discount of $228,550 was attributed to the beneficial conversion feature
of the note, which amount was then amortized fully during the six months ended June 30, 2016.  

Stock-Based Compensation 

On January 29, 2015, the Company
adopted the 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan). The total number of shares available for the grant of either stock options
or compensation stock under the 2015 Plan is 150,000 shares, subject to adjustment. The exercise price per share of each stock
option shall not be less than 20 percent of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. At September
30, 2016, there were 53,750 options issued under the Plan outstanding, which options vest at the rate of at least 25 percent in
the first year, starting 6-months after the grant date, and 75% in year two.

On September 8, 2016, the Company
adopted the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2016 Plan). The total number of shares available for the grant of either stock options
or compensation stock under the Plan is 500,000 shares, subject to adjustment. The exercise price per share of each stock option
shall not be less than 100 percent of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. At September 30,
2016, there were 105,000 options issued under the Plan outstanding, which options vest in a series of twelve (12) successive equal
quarterly installments measured from the grant date. 

The Company also issues, from
time to time, options which are not registered under a formal option plan. At September 30, 2016, there were 50,000 options outstanding
that were not issued under the 2015 Plan. 

A summary of all stock option
activity at and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is presented below: 

(1) 60,000 options granted
under 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (of which 6,250 options were cancelled in the nine months ended September 30, 2016); 50,000 non-plan
options were granted. 

The aggregate intrinsic value
of options outstanding at September 30, 2016 was $42,000. 

At September 30, 2016, there
were 140,469 unvested options with an aggregate grant date fair value of $328,275. The unvested options will vest in accordance
with the vesting schedule in each respective option agreement, which is generally over a period of 6 to 36 months. The aggregate
intrinsic value of unvested options at September 30, 2016 was $42,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, 15,677
options became vested. 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes
valuation model to measure the grant-date fair value of stock options. The grant-date fair value of stock options issued to employees
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Stock-based awards issued to nonemployees are recorded
at fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic market adjustments as the underlying stock-based awards vest.
To determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes valuation model, the calculation takes into consideration
the effect of the following: 

Exercise
                                         price of the option    

Fair
                                         value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant    

Expected
                                         term of the option    

Expected
                                         volatility over the expected term of the option    

Risk-free
                                         interest rate for the expected term of the option

The calculation includes several
assumptions that require management's judgment. The expected term of the options is calculated using the simplified method described
in GAAP. The simplified method defines the expected term as the average of the contractual term and the vesting period. Estimated
volatility is derived from volatility calculated using historical closing prices of common shares of similar entities whose share
prices are publicly available for the expected term of the options. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury
constant maturities in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the options. 

The following weighted-average
assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes valuation model for options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

The following weighted-average
assumptions were used in the Black-Scholes valuation model for options granted during the year ended December 31, 2015: 

The weighted-average grant-date
fair value per share of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.06. The weighted-average
grant-date fair value per share of stock options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $14.20. 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, total stock option expense related to stock options was $154,707 and $124,250 respectively. At September
30, 2016, the total compensation cost related to stock options not yet recognized was approximately $194,263, which is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average period of approximately 2.46 years. 

Warrants 

During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company issued detachable warrants in connection to notes payable to purchase 525,000 shares of common
stock. The Company has determined the Warrants are classified as equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September
30, 2016. No warrants were exercised during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The estimated fair value of the warrants after
relative fair value allocation at issuance was $282,662, based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the weighted-average
assumptions below:

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes. This section of the Quarterly Report
includes a number of forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended that reflect our current views with respect to future events and
financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend,
project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty
on these forward-looking statements which speak only as of the date made, and except as required by law, we undertake no obligation
to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. These forward-looking
statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking
statements. Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to, customer acceptance risks for current and new
brands, reliance on external sources on financing, development risks for new products and brands, dependence on wholesale distributors,
inventory carrying issues, fluctuations in market demand and customer preferences, as well as general conditions of the alcohol
and beverage industry, and other factors discussed in Item 1A of Part I of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015 entitled  Risk Factors,  similar discussions in subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, including
this Form 10-Q, as applicable, and those contained from time to time in our other filings with the Securities Exchange Commission . 

Overview  

We were incorporated
on February 11, 2004 in Nevada as Eurocan Holdings, Ltd. Until closing of the Acquisition (described below), Eurocan operated solely
as an online marketing and media solutions firm specializing in digital interactive media, which business was conducted through
Eurocan s wholly-owned subsidiary, Michael Williams Web Design Inc. of New York, NY ( MWWD ). 

On December 1, 2014,
we changed our corporate name to  Eastside Distilling, Inc.  from Eurocan Holdings Ltd, to reflect our then recent
acquisition of Eastside Distilling, LLC, which resulted in us primarily conducting Eastside s business thereafter (See  The
Acquisition of Eastside Distilling, LLC  below).   Until February 3, 2015, we continued to operate our online
marketing and media solutions  business through MWW (See  Spin-Off of MWW  below). 

The Acquisition of Eastside Distilling,
LLC  

On October 31, 2014,
Eurocan Holdings Ltd. ( we,   us,  or the  Company ) consummated the acquisition (the  Acquisition )
of Eastside Distilling, LLC ( Eastside ) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Agreement )
by and among the Company, Eastside, and Eastside Distilling, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the Agreement, Eastside
merged with and into Eastside Distilling, Inc. The merger consideration for the acquisition consisted of 1,600,000 shares (the
 Shares ) of our common stock.   In addition, certain of our stockholders cancelled an aggregate of 1,245,500
shares of our common stock held by them. As a result, upon consummation of the Agreement on October 31, 2014, we had 2,000,000
shares of our common stock issued and outstanding, of which 1,600,000 shares were held by the former members of Eastside.  The
issuance of these Shares was exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ),
pursuant to exemptions afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder, and/or
Regulation S promulgated thereunder. 

At the effective time
of the Acquisition, our officers and directors resigned, and Steven Earles and Lenny Gotter were appointed as directors to our
board of directors. In addition, concurrent with closing of the Acquisition, the Company appointed Mr. Earles as Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman and Mr. Gotter as Chief Operating Officer and Secretary. Mr. Gotter resigned as an
officer in February 2015. In October 2015, Steven Shum was appointed as Chief Financial Officer, and Mr. Earles simultaneously
resigned as Chief Financial Officer. 

Following the Acquisition,
we conduct the business of Eastside as our primary business. 

Eastside
is a manufacturer, developer, producer and marketer of master-crafted spirits in the following beverage alcohol categories: bourbon,
whiskey, rum and vodka. Eastside currently distributes its products in 22 states ( California, New York,
Florida, Texas, Illinois,  Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire,
Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington)   and
is authorized to distribute our products in Ontario, Canada, as well.  Eastside also generates revenue from tastings,
tasting room tours, private parties and merchandise sales from its distillery and showroom located on the Distillery Row in Portland,
Oregon.  

Spin-Off of MWWD  

Following consummation
of the Acquisition, our new management conducted an evaluation of the MWWD business and an analysis of the business going forward.
Management determined that due to MWWD s operating and net losses in each of the last two fiscal years preceding the Acquisition,
its working capital deficit as of the end of the latest fiscal year and as of the latest fiscal quarter preceding the Acquisition,
and its accumulated deficit, it was not in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders to continue the operation of MWWD
going forward. Accordingly, on February 3, 2015, we transferred all shares of MWWD held by us along with all assets and liabilities
related to MWWD to Michael Williams in consideration of MWWD s and Mr. Williams  full release of all claims and liabilities
related to MWWD and the MWWD business. Mr. Williams is the sole officer, director and employee of MWWD. The spinoff of MWWD resulted
in the impairment of goodwill related to the Acquisition of approximately $3.2 million in December 2014. Additionally, as a result
of the Spin-Off, we recorded a net gain of approximately $52,890 on February 3, 2015. This gain is primarily the result of the
transfer of net liabilities to Michael Williams, which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December 31, 2015.

Results of Operations and Financial Condition   

Overview    

Net
sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased 73% over the comparable 2015 period. The increase was primarily due
to expanded distribution into new states along with continued growth in the company's home Oregon market. Case sales in Oregon
increased 19% during the third quarter. However, wholesale case sales in Oregon grew 61% while the Oregon retail sales declined
34% primarily due to fewer retail locations operating during the quarter. Case sales outside of Oregon grew 182% compared to the
year ago period. While the Oregon market continues to experience year-over-year growth, Oregon, as a percentage of total sales,
was lower in the three months ended September 30, 2016 as the new markets continue to become a larger component to overall sales.
Approximately  42% of sales during the third quarter came from outside the state of Oregon compared to 23% in the year ago
period.  As our national expansion continues, we remain focused on working with the major distributors
within the key states. We have also focused our internal sales team on key regions that offer the greatest return opportunities.  

During the quarter,
we reached an important milestone with our products now approved and selling across a total of 22 states, including all 5 of the
top consumption states (California, New York, Florida, Texas and Illinois). During the period, we also received our single largest
purchase order in the Company s history. 

We have also invested
heavily in our infrastructure (facilities, people, and marketing programs) over the past two years to support this national expansion
effort. As the business continues to grow, we believe we can leverage those investments and drive toward improved performance
throughout the balance of 2016 and into 2017. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the
Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Net Sales  

Net sales consist of
revenues from the sale of products we supply or distribute less excise taxes. The following table sets forth and compares our net
sales (in thousands of dollars) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our net sales increased by approximately $256,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, or approximately
73%, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily the result of increased sales in Oregon
as well as sales growth in new states. 

Gross profit is calculated
by subtracting the cost of products sold from net sales. Cost of sales consists of the costs of ingredients utilized in the production
of spirits, contract production fees, overhead, packaging and in-bound freight charges. Ingredients account for the largest portion
of the cost of sales, followed by contract production fees and packaging. Gross margin is gross profits stated as a percentage
of net sales. 

The following table
compares our gross profit (in thousands of dollars) and gross margin in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our gross margin of
39% of net sales in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was lower than the gross margin of 52% for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Gross margin was largely impacted by higher raw material costs experienced during the period and to a lesser
extent product mix. We have recently been able to improve the input costs, which we expect will benefit future periods. 

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses  

Selling, general and
administrative ( SG A ) expenses include marketing and advertising costs and expenses, compensation paid (including
non-cash stock-based compensation) to general and administrative personnel, depreciation expense and professional fees. The following
table sets forth our SG A expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 (in thousands of dollars): 

Our SG A expenses
decreased by approximately $3,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, approximately $534,000 of these expenses were attributable to professional
fees, and $52,000 to non-cash expenses associated with stock-based compensation. 

Other Expense, Net  

The following table
compares our other expense (in thousands of dollars) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Other expense in the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 is primarily related to interest expense. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the
Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Net Sales  

Net sales consist
of revenues from the sale of products we supply or distribute less excise taxes. The following table sets forth and compares our
net sales in (in thousands of dollars) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our net sales increased by approximately $594,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, or approximately
60%, from the comparable 2015 period. The increase in net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was primarily the
result of increased sales in Oregon as well as sales growth in new states. 

Gross profit is calculated
by subtracting the cost of products sold from net sales. Cost of sales consists of the costs of ingredients utilized in the production
of spirits, contract production fees, overhead, packaging and in-bound freight charges. Ingredients account for the largest portion
of the cost of sales, followed by contract production fees and packaging. Gross margin is gross profits stated as a percentage
of net sales. 

The following table compares our gross profit (in thousands of dollars) and gross margin in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our gross margin of
43% of net sales in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 declined from our gross margin of 47% for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 primarily due to higher raw material costs experienced during the period and to a lesser extent product mix. 

Selling, General and Administrative
Expenses  

Selling, general and
administrative ( SG A ) expenses include marketing and advertising costs and expenses, compensation paid (including
non-cash stock-based compensation) to general and administrative personnel, depreciation expense and professional fees. The following
table sets forth our SG A expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 (in thousands of dollars): 

Our SG A expenses increased by approximately $517,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from
the comparable 2015 period. This increase was primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees of $220,000, stock-based compensation
expense of $84,000 and higher payroll costs. 

Other (Expense) Income, Net  

The following table compares our other (expense) income, net (in thousands of dollars) for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Other expense in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 is primarily related to the expense associated with the amortization of a beneficial conversion feature on
the convertible notes payable, amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest expense. In the prior year, we recorded lower
interest expense which was offset by a one-time gain related to the spin-off of MWW. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Our primary capital
requirements are for the financing of inventories and sales and marketing efforts. Funds for such purposes have historically been
generated from our operations, extended payment terms from suppliers for inventory purchases, notes payable and equity raisings. 

We have a history of
losses over the past two years, including the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for which we have generated negative operating
cash flows. During the nine months ended September  30, 2016 and 2015, we had net losses of $3.8 million and $2.9 million,
respectively and net cash used in operating activities for the corresponding nine months was approximately $3.1 million and $1.2
million, respectively. As a result, since fiscal 2014, it has been necessary to rely on raising new equity or extended payment
terms from vendors for our capital and working capital needs. 

At September 30, 2016,
we had no outstanding convertible notes payable, compared to approximately $0.46 million as of December 31, 2015. In addition,
we had long-term notes outstanding of $0.93 million (net of the debt discount) at September 30, 2016, compared to $0.02 million
at September 30, 2015. As a consequence of our indebtedness as of September 30, 2016, a portion of our cash flow from operations
must be dedicated to interest payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund capital
expenditures or other growth initiatives and other general corporate requirements. 

Our short-term and
long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from our working capital and debt service requirements. We anticipate that capital expenditures
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016 will be approximately $20,000, primarily for increased manufacturing capacity. As
of September 30, 2016, we had cash of approximately $400,000. 

Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $3.1
million resulting primarily from our net loss of $3,760,629 and changes in trade receivables, inventories, and accounts payable
of $240,798, $197,828, and $476,158, respectively, which amounts were offset by depreciation and amortization of $16,579, amortization
of debt issuance costs of $116,750, amortization of beneficial conversion feature of $228,549, issuance of common stock in exchange
for services of $218,970, stock-based compensation of $208,977, prepaid expenses and other assets of $94,127, accrued liabilities
of $657,650, and deferred revenue of $2,467. This is compared to net cash used in operating activities of $1,241,924 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 resulting primarily from our net loss of $2,931,690 plus inventories of $436,565 and gain on spin-off
of subsidiary of $52,890, which amounts were offset by depreciation and amortization of $13,927, issuance of common stock in exchange
for services of $715,871, stock-based compensation of $124,250, trade receivables of $74,103, accounts payable of $821,457, prepaid
expenses and other assets of $89,704, and accrued liabilities of $338,770. During the period ended September 30, 2016, operating
cash flow was significantly impacted by certain expenses, which management does not anticipate to continue to recur, such as additional
interest and legal costs totaling approximately $275,000, associated with the repayment of the prior notes outstanding. 

Net cash flows used
in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,952 compared to $42,856 during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

Net cash flows provided
by financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,397,157 consisting of $463,080 from net cash proceeds
from our series A preferred stock and warrant offering, $2,000,000 in proceeds from our common stock and warrant offering, $1,250,000
from our long-term note and warrant financing, and $185,000 from convertible note financing, which amount was offset by $500,923
in payments of principal on prior convertible notes payable. Our net cash flows provided by financing activities for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 was $287,868, principally consisting of net proceeds received from the issuance of convertible notes of
$291,500, which was offset by $3,632 in payments on convertible notes payable. 

In order to meet its
cash and liquidity needs, we intend to raise additional debt and equity financing. There is no assurance that we will be
successful in obtaining additional financing and/or be able to renegotiate the terms of its existing debt obligations on terms
which are satisfactory to us, or at all. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating
to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result
from this uncertainty. 

Our ability to improve
our liquidity in future periods and continue as a going concern will depend on generating positive operating cash flow, primarily
through increased distribution into other states, improved gross profit and controlling our expenses, which in turn, may be impacted
by prevailing economic conditions and other financial and business factors, some of which are beyond our control. 

We have incurred a net loss of $3,760,629 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and have incurred cumulative
losses of $11,359,739 through September 30, 2016, and expect to incur further losses in the development of our business and have
been dependent on funding operations through the issuance of debt, convertible debt and private sale of equity securities. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

Note and Warrant Financing  

On June 30, 2016, we
issued $200,000 of principal amount of 8% promissory notes and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock to three accredited
investors. The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the notes and warrants were $200,000. The notes have a 2-year maturity
dates and bear interest at eight percent (8%) per annum. The notes were issued with warrants to purchase up to 100,000 shares of
our common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. The number of warrant shares underlying each warrant are equal to the
principal amount of the promissory note subscribed for by a Subscriber multiplied by one-half (0.5). The warrants will be exercisable
for three (3) years after the closing date. The proceeds are being used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

From July 1, 2016 to September 30, 2016,
we issued $1,050,000 of principal amount of 8% promissory notes and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock to six accredited
investors. The aggregate gross proceeds from the sale of the notes and warrants were $1,050,000. The notes have a 2-year maturity
dates and bear interest at eight percent (8%) per annum. The notes were issued with warrants to purchase up to 525,000 shares of
our common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share. The number of warrant shares underlying each warrant are equal to the
principal amount of the promissory note subscribed for by a Subscriber multiplied by one-half (0.5). The warrants will be exercisable
for three (3) years after the closing date. The proceeds are being used for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Common Stock and Warrant Unit Financing

From June 4, 2016 to
June 22, 2016, we conducted closings for the sale of 40,000,000 units ( Common Units ) to 18 accredited investors at
a price of $0.05 per Common Unit for an aggregate cash purchase price of $2,000,000. Each Common Unit consists of one-twentieth
(0.05) share of our Common Stock. The total Common Units also included warrants (the  Warrants ), exercisable for 3-years,
to purchase 2,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per whole share (the  Warrant Shares ). 

We used approximately
$100,000 of the proceeds received to prepay in full that certain 14% Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated May 13, 2016 in
the original principal amount of $219,200. The prepayment amount for this note referred to in our Current Report in Form 8-K dated
June 1, 2016 was reduced due to the note holder s conversion of principal under this note into shares of our common stock
following receipt of the prepayment notice, as permitted under the terms of such note. We used approximately $308,975 to prepay
in full that certain 14% Secured Convertible Promissory Note dated May 13, 2016 in the original principal amount of $302,646 and
approximately $130,594 to repay in full the remaining amounts due under that certain 5% Convertible Promissory Note in the original
principal amount of $150,000, which was paid in June 2016. The remaining proceeds are being used for inventory purchases and for
working capital and general corporate purposes. 

Series A Convertible Preferred Stock
and Warrant Financing  

From April 4, 2016
to June 17, 2016, we conducted closings for 972 units ( Units ) to 15 accredited investors and 1 unaccredited investor
at a price of $1,000 per Unit for an aggregate purchase price of $972,000, of which (i) 499 Units were purchased for $499,000
in cash (ii) 423 Units were purchased by certain of our officers in consideration of $423,000 accrued and unpaid salary and (iii)
50 Units were purchased in consideration of cancellation of $50,000 of outstanding indebtedness.  Each Unit consists of (i)
1 share of our Series A Convertible Preferred Stock convertible into shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share ( Common
Stock ) at a rate of $1.50 per share and (ii) one Warrant, exercisable for 3-years, to purchase six hundred sixty-seven
(667) shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per whole share.  We received gross proceeds of $499,000 from
the sale of the 499 Units for cash. We used $35,920 of these proceeds as payment for non-exclusive placement agent fees to FINRA
registered broker-dealers.   In addition, approximately $25,000 was used to repay outstanding indebtedness under 5%
promissory notes.  The remaining proceeds are being used for working capital and general corporate purposes and to fund growth
opportunities. 

Convertible Notes  

On September 10, 2015,
we issued and sold a convertible promissory note bearing interest at 14% per annum in the principal amount of $275,000 to WWOD
Holdings, LLC, an accredited investor ( WWOD ). This note had a maturity date of May 10, 2016 and an original issue
discount of $33,500. Accordingly, we received gross proceeds of $241,500. After paying the investors expenses, we received net
proceeds of $241,500, which proceeds were used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The conversion price for this
note is equal to the lesser of (i) the Fixed Conversion Price ($3.00) or (ii) 65% of the lowest trading price of our common stock
during the 5-trading days prior to conversion. This note contains certain covenants and restrictions including, among others, that
for so long as this note is outstanding we will not incur indebtedness, permit liens, pay dividends or dispose of certain assets.
Events of default under the note include, among others, failure to pay principal or interest on the note or comply with certain
covenants under the note. The note is secured by all of our assets. 

On April 14, 2016,
we entered into an Amendment Agreement with WWOD and MR Group I, LLC ( Investor ). The Amendment Agreement amends
that certain securities purchase agreement on September 10, 2015 (the  Existing SPA ), with WWOD pursuant to which
we issued and sold to WWOD a convertible promissory note, bearing interest at 14% per annum in the principal amount of $275,000
(the  Initial Note ). The Amendment Agreement amended the Existing SPA to reflect an additional closing under the
Existing SPA (as amended by the Amendment Agreement the  Amended SPA ) pursuant to which we issued and sold to Investor
a convertible promissory note dated April 18, 2016, bearing interest at 14% per annum in the principal amount of $300,000 (the
 Additional Note , together with the Initial Note, the  Notes ). The Additional Note was issued on April
18, 2016 and has a maturity date of January 18, 2017 and an original issue discount of $100,000; provided, however, that in the
event that we consummate the additional proposed $2 million financing with Investor for which we have executed a non-binding term
sheet (the  Subsequent Placement ), $200,000 of aggregate principal of the Additional Note, together with any accrued,
and unpaid, interest then outstanding under the Additional Note, shall be applied, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, to reduce the
purchase price of the Investor in such Subsequent Placement and upon the closing of such Subsequent Placement and such application,
the remainder of the Additional Note then outstanding shall be deemed cancelled for no additional consideration. Accordingly,
we received gross proceeds from the Investor of $200,000. After paying $15,000 of the Investor s expenses in connection
with the Amended SPA (with payment of the remaining expenses deferred), we received net proceeds of $185,000, which is to be used
for working capital and general corporate purposes. Concurrent with the SPA, WWOD contributed the Initial Note to Investor. Following
issuance of the Additional Note, the aggregate principal amount of Notes issued under the Amended SPA is $575,000, both of which
are now held by the Investor. In connection with the issuance of the Additional Note, we entered into an Amended and Restated
Security and Pledge Agreement dated April 18, 2016 pursuant to which the Notes are secured by all of our assets. We have agreed
to repay the Additional Note in nine installments ( Amortization Payments ) at set forth in the Amortization Schedule
attached to the Note beginning 30th day after issuance and each 30-days thereafter. However, failure to make any Amortization
Payment will not be deemed an event of default under the Additional Note. In addition, the Additional Note can be prepaid at any
time until the date immediately preceding the Maturity Date. The Additional Note is convertible into common stock at a conversion
price is equal to the lesser of (i) the Fixed Conversion Price ($8.00) or (ii) 65% of the lowest trading price of our common stock
during the 5-trading days prior to conversion. The Additional Note contains certain covenants and restrictions including, restrictions
on our ability to incur indebtedness, permit liens, pay dividends or dispose of certain assets. Events of default under the note
include, among others, failure to pay principal or interest on the note or comply with certain covenants under the note. 

On May 13, 2016, we
entered into Exchange Agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ) with the Investor pursuant to which we (i) issued Investor
a 14% secured convertible promissory note dated May 13, 2016 in the aggregate principal amount of $219,201 with an August 31,
2016 maturity date (the  Note ) in exchange for a previously issued 14% secured convertible promissory note dated
September 10, 2015 in the original principal amount of $275,000 (with current outstanding principal and interest of $197,208 and
$21,993, respectively) with a May 10, 2016 maturity date held by Investor and (ii) issued Investor a 14% secured convertible promissory
note dated May 13, 2016 in the aggregate principal amount of $302,646 with an April 30, 2017 maturity date (the  Second
Note , together with the Note, the  Exchange Notes ) in exchange for a previously issued 14% secured convertible
promissory note dated April 18, 2016 in the original principal amount of $300,000 (with current outstanding principal and interest
of $300,000 and $2,647, respectively) with a May 10, 2016 maturity date held by Investor. In the event that we consummate the
additional proposed $2 million financing with Investor for which we have executed a non-binding term sheet (the  Subsequent
Placement ), $200,000 of aggregate principal of the Second Note, together with any accrued, and unpaid, interest then outstanding
or any additional amounts due and payable as a result of an event of default under the Second Note, shall be applied, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, to reduce the purchase price of the Investor in such Subsequent Placement and upon the closing of such Subsequent Placement
and such application, the remainder of the Second Note then outstanding shall be deemed cancelled for no additional consideration. 

In connection with
the issuance of the Exchange Notes, we entered into a Security and Pledge Agreement dated May 13, 2016 pursuant to which the Exchange
Notes are secured by all of our assets. The Exchange Notes can be prepaid at any time until the date immediately preceding their
respective Maturity Dates. The Exchange Notes are convertible into common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of (i)
the Fixed Conversion Price ($3.00 for the Note and $8.00 for the Second Note) or (ii) 65% of the lowest trading price of our common
stock during the (i) 5-trading days prior to conversion (for conversions on or before May 22, 2016 or (ii) 10-trading days prior
to conversion (for conversions after May 22, 2016). The Exchange Note contains certain covenants and restrictions including, restrictions
on our ability to incur indebtedness, permit liens, pay dividends or dispose of certain assets. Events of default under the Exchange
Notes include, among others, failure to pay principal or interest on the note or comply with certain covenants under the note.
We will be required to repay the Exchange Notes at 133% upon an event of default. We prepaid each of the Exchange Notes in June
2016. 

On June 13, 2014,
we issued Crystal Falls Investments, LLC a demand promissory note in the amount of approximately $150,000, which note was amended
on September 19, 2014 to be a 5% convertible promissory note. The amended note bears interest at 5% per annum and had a maturity
date of June 13, 2015. The amended note may be converted into shares of our common stock at a fixed conversion price of $8.00
per share. This amended note may be prepaid upon payment of 150% of the outstanding principal amount to the holder. The amended
note was further amended on July 24, 2015 to extend the maturity date to December 13, 2015. Effective December 13, 2015, this
note was further amended to: (i) provide for partial repayment of the Note ($110,000) following a Qualified Financing; (ii) extend
the Maturity Date under the Note until the  earlier  of (A) 45-days after the initial closing of a Qualified Financing or
(B) April 1, 2016; and (iii) remove the prepayment provision requiring 150% of the Note upon prepayment.  Qualified Financing 
means either (i) a sale of our equity securities pursuant to which we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of at least two-hundred
fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) or (ii) a credit facility of up to three-million five hundred thousand dollars ($3,500,000)
pursuant to which we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of at least four-hundred thousand dollars ($400,000) upon the initial
closing of such facility. Effective April 1, 2016, the note was further amended to extend the Maturity Date until May 31, 2016
and provide for installment payments of the principal amount beginning March 31, 2016 to the May 31, 2016 maturity date. On May
31, 2016, we received a waiver from the holder of that certain 5% Convertible Note in the original principal amount of $150,000
with a then stated maturity date of May 31, 2016. The holder of such note agreed to waive any default resulting from non-payment
so long as full payment is received by holder on or before June 30, 2016 (the  Waiver Termination Date ). On June
17, 2016, we entered into an Amendment No. 1 to Waiver pursuant to which the Waiver Termination Date was extended to July 1, 2016.
This note was repaid in full on July 1, 2016. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Acquisition  

The acquisition of
Eastside Distilling LLC by Eurocan Holdings, Ltd. (now known as Eastside Distilling Inc.) on October 31, 2014, was accounted for
as a reverse acquisition with Eastside Distilling LLC as the acquirer of Eurocan. The financial statements presented in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q are presented as a continuation of the operations of Eastside Distilling LLC with one adjustment to retroactively
adjust the legal common stock shares of Eastside Distilling Inc. to reflect the legal capital of Eurocan prior to the October 31,
2014 acquisition. 

Revenue Recognition  

We record revenue
when all four of the following criteria are met: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery of
the products and/or services has occurred; (iii) the selling price is fixed or determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably
assured. 

We recognize sales
when merchandise is shipped from a warehouse directly to wholesale customers (except in the case of a consignment sale). For consignment
sales, which include sales to the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC), we recognize sales upon the consignee s shipment
to the customer. Postage and handling charges billed to customers are also recognized as sales upon shipment of the related merchandise.
Shipping terms are generally FOB shipping point, and title passes to the customer at the time and place of shipment or purchase
by customers at a retail location. For consignment sales, title passes to the consignee concurrent with the consignee s
shipment to the customer. The customer has no cancellation privileges after shipment or upon purchase at retail locations, other
than customary rights of return. We exclude sales tax collected and remitted to various states from sales and cost of sales. Sales
from items sold through our retail location are recognized at the time of sale. 

Revenue received from
online merchants who sell discounted gift certificates for our merchandise and tastings is deferred until the customer has redeemed
the discounted gift certificate or the gift certificate has expired, whichever occurs earlier. 

Cost of Sales  

Cost of sales consists
of the costs of ingredients utilized in the production of spirits, manufacturing labor and overhead, warehousing rent, packaging,
and in-bound freight charges. Ingredients account for the largest portion of the cost of sales, followed by contract production
fees and packaging. 

Shipping and Fulfillment Costs  

Freight costs incurred
related to shipment of merchandise from Eastside s distribution facilities to customers are recorded in cost of sales. 

Concentrations  

We sell to third-party
resellers and performs ongoing credit evaluations of trade receivables due from third-party resellers. Generally, we do not require
collateral. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined with respect to those amounts that we have determined to be doubtful
of collection using specific identification of doubtful accounts and an aging of receivables analysis based on invoice due dates.
Generally, trade receivables are past due after 30 days after an invoice date, unless special payment terms are provided. Based
on this analysis, we did not record an allowance for doubtful accounts at September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Financial instruments
that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of accounts receivable. At September 30, 2016,
two customers represented an aggregate of 77% trade receivables. At December 31, 2015, one customer represented 57% of trade receivables. 

Inventories  

Inventories primarily
consist of bulk and bottled liquor and merchandise and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using an
average costing methodology, which approximates cost under the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. A portion of inventory is held
by the OLCC on consignment until it is sold to a third party. Eastside regularly monitors inventory quantities on hand and records
write-downs for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.
Such write-downs establish a new cost basis of accounting for the related inventory. We have recorded no write-downs of inventory
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Advertising  

Advertising costs
are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was approximately $170,000 and $244,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, respectively, and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of
income. 

Excise Taxes  

We are responsible
for compliance with the TTB regulations which includes making timely and accurate excise tax payments. Eastside is subject to
periodic compliance audits by the TTB. Individual states also impose excise taxes on alcohol beverages in varying amounts. We
calculate our excise tax expense based upon units produced and on its understanding of the applicable excise tax laws. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We have no significant
off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that are material. 

ITEM 3  
QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

As a  smaller
reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this
item. 

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

In connection with
the preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by our management, with the participation
of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ) as of September
30, 2016. Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC
rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer
and the Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In performing the assessment for the
quarter ended September 30, 2016, our management concluded that our financial reporting controls and procedures were not effective
to accomplish the foregoing, due to the following material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting: 

Procedures for
Control Evaluation.   Management has not established with appropriate rigor the procedures for evaluating internal
controls over financial reporting. Due to limited resources and lack of segregation of duties, documentation of the limited control
structure has not been accomplished. 

Newly Formed
Audit Committee.   On September 8, 2016, our board of directors established an audit committee to oversee the engagement
of our independent public accounts, review our audited financial statements, meet with our independent public accounts to review
internal controls and review our financial plans. Our audit committee currently consists of Michael Fleming, who is the chair of
the committee, and Trent Davis, each of whom has been determined by our board of directors to be independent in accordance with
OTCQX and SEC standards. Mr. Fleming is an  audit committee financial expert  as the term is defined under SEC regulations.
The audit committee operates under a written charter. Both our independent registered accounting firm and internal financial personnel
will regularly meet with our audit committee and have unrestricted access to the audit committee. 

Insufficient
Documentation of Review Procedures  . We employ policies and procedures for reconciliation of the financial statements and
note disclosures, however, these processes are not appropriately documented. 

Insufficient
Information Technology Procedures.   Management has not established methodical and consistent data back-up procedures
to ensure loss of data will not occur. 

Changes in Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

As of the end of the
period covered by this report, there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f)
of the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially
affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness
of Controls and Procedures  

In designing and evaluating
the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and
operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure
controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its
judgment in evaluating the benefits of possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.

suit or proceeding that such Committee did not act in good faith and in a manner which such person reasonably believed to be in
the best interests of the Company, or in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reason to believe that the conduct complained
of was unlawful;  provided, however , that within 60 days after institution of any such action, suit or proceeding, such Committee

of Options . Each Option may, but need not, vest and therefore become exercisable in periodic installments that may, but need
not, be equal. The Option may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may be exercised (which
may be based on performance or other criteria) as the Committee may deem appropriate, provided, however, that if no vesting schedule
is specified at the time of grant, the Option shall be vested according to the following schedule: one-fourth (1/4 th )
of the shares subject to the Option shall vest one year following the date that the Option commences vesting as specified at the
time of grant, or, if no date is specified at the time of grant, the Grant Date (such date for such Option, the   Vesting
Commencement Date  ), and the balance of the shares subject to the Option shall vest in a series of thirty-six (36) successive
equal monthly installments measured from the first anniversary of the Vesting Commencement Date, subject to Optionholder s
Continuous Service as of each such date. 

The vesting provisions
of individual Options may vary. No Option may be exercised for a fraction of a share of Common Stock. The Committee may, but shall
not be required to, provide for an acceleration of vesting and exercisability in the terms of any Award Agreement upon the occurrence
of a specified event. 

6.8     Termination
of Continuous Service . Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement or in an employment agreement the terms of which have
been approved by the Committee, in the event an Optionholder s Continuous Service terminates (other than upon the Optionholder s
death or Disability), the Optionholder may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that the Optionholder was entitled to exercise
such Option as of the date of termination) but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of (a) the date three months
following the termination of the Optionholder s Continuous Service or (b) the expiration of the term of the Option as set
forth in the Award Agreement;  provided that , if the termination of Continuous Service is by the Company for Cause, all outstanding
Options (whether or not vested) shall immediately terminate and cease to be exercisable. If, after termination, the Optionholder
does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified in the Award Agreement, the Option shall terminate. 

6.9      Extension
of Termination Date . An Optionholder s Award Agreement may also provide that if the exercise of the Option following
the termination of the Optionholder s Continuous Service for any reason would be prohibited at any time because the issuance
of shares of Common Stock would violate the registration requirements under the Securities Act or any other state or federal securities
law or the rules of any securities exchange or interdealer quotation system, then the Option shall terminate on the earlier of
(a) the expiration of the term of the Option in accordance with   Section  6.1  or (b) the expiration of a period after
termination of the Participant s Continuous Service that is three months after the end of the period during which the exercise
of the Option would be in violation of such registration or other securities law requirements. 

6.10    Disability
of Optionholder . Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, in the event that an Optionholder s Continuous Service
terminates as a result of the Optionholder s Disability, the Optionholder may exercise his or her Option (to the extent that
the Optionholder was entitled to exercise such Option as of the date of termination), but only within such period of time ending
on the earlier of (a) the date 12 months following such termination or (b) the expiration of the term of the Option as set forth
in the Award Agreement. If, after termination, the Optionholder does not exercise his or her Option within the time specified herein
or in the Award Agreement, the Option shall terminate. 

6.11    Death
of Optionholder . Unless otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, in the event an Optionholder s Continuous Service terminates
as a result of the Optionholder s death, then the Option may be exercised (to the extent the Optionholder was entitled to
exercise such Option as of the date of death) by the Optionholder s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise
the Option by bequest or inheritance or by a person designated to exercise the Option upon the Optionholder s death, but
only within the period ending on the earlier of (a) the date 12 months following the date of death or (b) the expiration of the
term of such Option as set forth in the Award Agreement. If, after the Optionholder s death, the Option is not exercised
within the time specified herein or in the Award Agreement, the Option shall terminate. 

6.12    Incentive
Stock Option $100,000 Limitation . To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined at the time of grant) of Common
Stock with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by any Optionholder during any calendar
year (under all plans of the Company and its Affiliates) exceeds $100,000, the Options or portions thereof which exceed such limit
(according to the order in which they were granted) shall be treated as Non-qualified Stock Options. 

7.       Provisions
of Awards Other Than Options . 

7.1       Stock
Appreciation Rights .   

(a)        General  

Each Stock Appreciation
Right granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Each Stock Appreciation Right so granted shall be subject
to the conditions set forth in this Section 7.1, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected
in the applicable Award Agreement. Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted alone (  Free Standing Rights  ) or
in tandem with an Option granted under the Plan (  Related Rights  ). 

(b)        Grant
Requirements  

Any Related Right that
relates to a Non-qualified Stock Option may be granted at the same time the Option is granted or at any time thereafter but before
the exercise or expiration of the Option. Any Related Right that relates to an Incentive Stock Option must be granted at the same
time the Incentive Stock Option is granted. 

(c)        Term
of Stock Appreciation Rights  

The term of a Stock
Appreciation Right granted under the Plan shall be determined by the Committee;  provided, however , no Stock Appreciation
Right shall be exercisable later than the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date. 

(d)        Vesting
of Stock Appreciation Rights  

Each Stock Appreciation
Right may, but need not, vest and therefore become exercisable in periodic installments that may, but need not, be equal. The Stock
Appreciation Right may be subject to such other terms and conditions on the time or times when it may be exercised as the Committee
may deem appropriate. The vesting provisions of individual Stock Appreciation Rights may vary. No Stock Appreciation Right may
be exercised for a fraction of a share of Common Stock. The Committee may, but shall not be required to, provide for an acceleration
of vesting and exercisability in the terms of any Stock Appreciation Right upon the occurrence of a specified event. 

(e)        Exercise
and Payment  

Upon exercise of a Stock
Appreciation Right, the holder shall be entitled to receive from the Company an amount equal to the number of shares of Common
Stock subject to the Stock Appreciation Right that is being exercised multiplied by the excess of (i) the Fair Market Value of
a share of Common Stock on the date the Award is exercised, over (ii) the exercise price specified in the Stock Appreciation Right
or related Option. Payment with respect to the exercise of a Stock Appreciation Right shall be made on the date of exercise. Payment
shall be made in the form of shares of Common Stock (with or without restrictions as to substantial risk of forfeiture and transferability,
as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion), cash or a combination thereof, as determined by the Committee. 

(f)         Exercise
Price  

The exercise price of
a Free Standing Stock Appreciation Right shall be determined by the Committee, but shall not be less than 100% of the Fair Market
Value of one share of Common Stock on the Grant Date of such Stock Appreciation Right. A Related Right granted simultaneously with
or subsequent to the grant of an Option and in conjunction therewith or in the alternative thereto shall have the same exercise
price as the related Option, shall be transferable only upon the same terms and conditions as the related Option, and shall be
exercisable only to the same extent as the related Option;  provided, however , that a Stock Appreciation Right, by its terms,
shall be exercisable only when the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock subject to the Stock Appreciation Right and related
Option exceeds the exercise price per share thereof and no Stock Appreciation Rights may be granted in tandem with an Option unless
the Committee determines that the requirements of   Section  7.1(b)  are satisfied. 

(g)        Reduction
in the Underlying Option Shares  

Upon any exercise of
a Related Right, the number of shares of Common Stock for which any related Option shall be exercisable shall be reduced by the
number of shares for which the Stock Appreciation Right has been exercised. The number of shares of Common Stock for which a Related
Right shall be exercisable shall be reduced upon any exercise of any related Option by the number of shares of Common Stock for
which such Option has been exercised. 

7.2       Restricted
Awards .   

(a)        General  

A Restricted Award is
an Award of actual shares of Common Stock (  Restricted Stock  ) or hypothetical Common Stock units (  Restricted
Stock Units  ) having a value equal to the Fair Market Value of an identical number of shares of Common Stock, which may,
but need not, provide that such Restricted Award may not be sold, assigned, transferred or otherwise disposed of, pledged or hypothecated
as collateral for a loan or as security for the performance of any obligation or for any other purpose for such period (the   Restricted
Period  ) as the Committee shall determine. Each Restricted Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award
Agreement. Each Restricted Award so granted shall be subject to the conditions set forth in this Section 7.2, and to such other
conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected in the applicable Award Agreement. 

(b)        Restricted
Stock and Restricted Stock Units  

(i)  Each Participant granted Restricted Stock shall execute and deliver to the Company an Award Agreement
with respect to the Restricted Stock setting forth the restrictions and other terms and conditions applicable to such Restricted
Stock. If the Committee determines that the Restricted Stock shall be held by the Company or in escrow rather than delivered to
the Participant pending the release of the applicable restrictions, the Committee may require the Participant to additionally execute
and deliver to the Company (A) an escrow agreement satisfactory to the Committee, if applicable and (B) the appropriate blank stock
power with respect to the Restricted Stock covered by such agreement. If a Participant fails to execute an agreement evidencing
an Award of Restricted Stock and, if applicable, an escrow agreement and stock power, the Award shall be null and void. Subject
to the restrictions set forth in the Award, the Participant generally shall have the rights and privileges of a shareholder as
to such Restricted Stock, including the right to vote such Restricted Stock and the right to receive dividends;  provided that ,
any cash dividends and stock dividends with respect to the Restricted Stock shall be withheld by the Company for the Participant s
account, and interest may be credited on the amount of the cash dividends withheld at a rate and subject to such terms as determined
by the Committee. The cash dividends or stock dividends so withheld by the Committee and attributable to any particular share of
Restricted Stock (and earnings thereon, if applicable) shall be distributed to the Participant in cash or, at the discretion of
the Committee, in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such dividends, if applicable, upon
the release of restrictions on such share and, if such share is forfeited, the Participant shall have no right to such dividends.   

(ii)  The terms and conditions of a grant of Restricted Stock Units shall be reflected in an Award Agreement.
No shares of Common Stock shall be issued at the time a Restricted Stock Unit is granted, and the Company will not be required
to set aside a fund for the payment of any such Award. A Participant shall have no voting rights with respect to any Restricted
Stock Units granted hereunder. The Committee may also grant Restricted Stock Units with a deferral feature, whereby settlement
is deferred beyond the vesting date until the occurrence of a future payment date or event set forth in an Award Agreement (  Deferred
Stock Units  ). At the discretion of the Committee, each Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit (representing one
share of Common Stock) may be credited with cash and stock dividends paid by the Company in respect of one share of Common Stock
(  Dividend Equivalents  ). Dividend Equivalents shall be withheld by the Company and credited to the Participant s
account, and interest may be credited on the amount of cash Dividend Equivalents withheld at a rate and subject to such terms as
determined by the Committee. Dividend Equivalents credited to a Participant s account and attributable to any particular
Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit (and earnings thereon, if applicable) shall be distributed in cash or, at the discretion
of the Committee, in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to the amount of such Dividend Equivalents and earnings,
if applicable, to the Participant upon settlement of such Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit and, if such Restricted
Stock Unit or Deferred Stock Unit is forfeited, the Participant shall have no right to such Dividend Equivalents.   

(c)        Restrictions  

(i)  Restricted Stock awarded to a Participant shall be subject to the following restrictions until
the expiration of the Restricted Period, and to such other terms and conditions as may be set forth in the applicable Award Agreement:
(A) if an escrow arrangement is used, the Participant shall not be entitled to delivery of the stock certificate; (B) the shares
shall be subject to the restrictions on transferability set forth in the Award Agreement; (C) the shares shall be subject to forfeiture
to the extent provided in the applicable Award Agreement; and (D) to the extent such shares are forfeited, the stock certificates
shall be returned to the Company, and all rights of the Participant to such shares and as a shareholder with respect to such shares
shall terminate without further obligation on the part of the Company.   

(ii)  Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units awarded to any Participant shall be subject to
(A) forfeiture until the expiration of the Restricted Period, and satisfaction of any applicable Performance Goals during such
period, to the extent provided in the applicable Award Agreement, and to the extent such Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock
Units are forfeited, all rights of the Participant to such Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units shall terminate without
further obligation on the part of the Company and (B) such other terms and conditions as may be set forth in the applicable Award
Agreement.   

(iii)  The Committee shall have the authority to remove any or all of the restrictions on the Restricted
Stock, Restricted Stock Units and Deferred Stock Units whenever it may determine that, by reason of changes in Applicable Laws
or other changes in circumstances arising after the date the Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or Deferred Stock Units are
granted, such action is appropriate.   

(d)        Restricted
Period  

With respect to Restricted
Awards, the Restricted Period shall commence on the Grant Date and end at the time or times set forth on a schedule established
by the Committee in the applicable Award Agreement. No Restricted Award may be granted or settled for a fraction of a share of
Common Stock. The Committee may, but shall not be required to, provide for an acceleration of vesting in the terms of any Award
Agreement upon the occurrence of a specified event. 

(e)        Delivery
of Restricted Stock and Settlement of Restricted Stock Units  

Upon the expiration of
the Restricted Period with respect to any shares of Restricted Stock, the restrictions set forth in   Section  7.2(c) 
and the applicable Award Agreement shall be of no further force or effect with respect to such shares, except as set forth in the
applicable Award Agreement. If an escrow arrangement is used, upon such expiration, the Company shall deliver to the Participant,
or his or her beneficiary, without charge, the stock certificate evidencing the shares of Restricted Stock which have not then
been forfeited and with respect to which the Restricted Period has expired (to the nearest full share) and any cash dividends or
stock dividends credited to the Participant s account with respect to such Restricted Stock and the interest thereon, if
any. Upon the expiration of the Restricted Period with respect to any outstanding Restricted Stock Units, or at the expiration
of the deferral period with respect to any outstanding Deferred Stock Units, the Company shall deliver to the Participant, or his
or her beneficiary, without charge, one share of Common Stock for each such outstanding vested Restricted Stock Unit or Deferred
Stock Unit (  Vested Unit  ) and cash equal to any Dividend Equivalents credited with respect to each such Vested
Unit in accordance with   Section  7.2(b)(ii)  hereof and the interest thereon or, at the discretion of the Committee,
in shares of Common Stock having a Fair Market Value equal to such Dividend Equivalents and the interest thereon, if any;  provided,
however , that, if explicitly provided in the applicable Award Agreement, the Committee may, in its sole discretion, elect to
pay cash or part cash and part Common Stock in lieu of delivering only shares of Common Stock for Vested Units. If a cash payment
is made in lieu of delivering shares of Common Stock, the amount of such payment shall be equal to the Fair Market Value of the
Common Stock as of the date on which the Restricted Period lapsed in the case of Restricted Stock Units, or the delivery date in
the case of Deferred Stock Units, with respect to each Vested Unit. 

(f)        Stock
Restrictions  

Each certificate representing
Restricted Stock awarded under the Plan shall bear a legend in such form as the Company deems appropriate. 

7.3       Performance
Share Awards . 

(a)        Grant
of Performance Share Awards   

Each Performance Share
Award granted under the Plan shall be evidenced by an Award Agreement. Each Performance Share Award so granted shall be subject
to the conditions set forth in this Section 7.3, and to such other conditions not inconsistent with the Plan as may be reflected
in the applicable Award Agreement. The Committee shall have the discretion to determine: (i) the number of shares of Common Stock
or stock-denominated units subject to a Performance Share Award granted to any Participant; (ii) the performance period applicable
to any Award; (iii) the conditions that must be satisfied for a Participant to earn an Award; and (iv) the other terms, conditions
and restrictions of the Award. 

(b)        Earning
Performance Share Awards  

The number of Performance
Shares earned by a Participant will depend on the extent to which the performance goals established by the Committee are attained
within the applicable Performance Period, as determined by the Committee. No payout shall be made with respect to any Performance
Share Award except upon written certification by the Committee that the minimum threshold performance goal(s) have been achieved. 

7.4     
 Performance Compensation Awards . 

(a)        General  

The Committee shall have
the authority, at the time of grant of any Award described in this Plan (other than Options and Stock Appreciation Rights granted
with an exercise price equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value per share of Common Stock on the Grant Date), to designate
such Award as a Performance Compensation Award in order to qualify such Award as  performance-based compensation  under
Section 162(m) of the Code. In addition, the Committee shall have the authority to make an Award of a cash bonus to any Participant
and designate such Award as a Performance Compensation Award in order to qualify such Award as  performance-based compensation 
under Section 162(m) of the Code. 

(b)        Eligibility  

The Committee will, in
its sole discretion, designate within the first 90 days of a Performance Period (or, if longer or shorter, within the maximum period
allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code) which Participants will be eligible to receive Performance Compensation Awards in respect
of such Performance Period. However, designation of a Participant eligible to receive an Award hereunder for a Performance Period
shall not in any manner entitle the Participant to receive payment in respect of any Performance Compensation Award for such Performance
Period. The determination as to whether or not such Participant becomes entitled to payment in respect of any Performance Compensation
Award shall be decided solely in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.4. Moreover, designation of a Participant eligible
to receive an Award hereunder for a particular Performance Period shall not require designation of such Participant eligible to
receive an Award hereunder in any subsequent Performance Period and designation of one person as a Participant eligible to receive
an Award hereunder shall not require designation of any other person as a Participant eligible to receive an Award hereunder in
such period or in any other period. 

(c)        Discretion
of Committee with Respect to Performance Compensation Awards  

With regard to a particular
Performance Period, the Committee shall have full discretion to select the length of such Performance Period (provided any such
Performance Period shall be not less than one fiscal quarter in duration), the type(s) of Performance Compensation Awards to be
issued, the Performance Criteria that will be used to establish the Performance Goal(s), the kind(s) and/or level(s) of the Performance
Goal(s) that is (are) to apply to the Company and the Performance Formula. Within the first 90 days of a Performance Period (or,
if longer or shorter, within the maximum period allowed under Section 162(m) of the Code), the Committee shall, with regard to
the Performance Compensation Awards to be issued for such Performance Period, exercise its discretion with respect to each of the
matters enumerated in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 7.4(c) and record the same in writing. 

(d)        Payment
of Performance Compensation Awards  

(i)   Condition to Receipt of Payment    

Unless otherwise provided
in the applicable Award Agreement, a Participant must be employed by the Company on the last day of a Performance Period to be
eligible for payment in respect of a Performance Compensation Award for such Performance Period. 

(ii)   Limitation    

A Participant shall
be eligible to receive payment in respect of a Performance Compensation Award only to the extent that: (A) the Performance Goals
for such period are achieved; and (B) the Performance Formula as applied against such Performance Goals determines that all or
some portion of such Participant's Performance Compensation Award has been earned for the Performance Period. 

(iii)   Certification    

Following the completion
of a Performance Period, the Committee shall review and certify in writing whether, and to what extent, the Performance Goals for
the Performance Period have been achieved and, if so, calculate and certify in writing the amount of the Performance Compensation
Awards earned for the period based upon the Performance Formula. The Committee shall then determine the actual size of each Participant's
Performance Compensation Award for the Performance Period and, in so doing, may apply Negative Discretion in accordance with Section
7.4(d)(iv) hereof, if and when it deems appropriate. 

(iv)   Use of Discretion    

In determining the
actual size of an individual Performance Compensation Award for a Performance Period, the Committee may reduce or eliminate the
amount of the Performance Compensation Award earned under the Performance Formula in the Performance Period through the use of
Negative Discretion if, in its sole judgment, such reduction or elimination is appropriate. The Committee shall not have the discretion
to (A) grant or provide payment in respect of Performance Compensation Awards for a Performance Period if the Performance Goals
for such Performance Period have not been attained or (B) increase a Performance Compensation Award above the maximum amount payable
under Section 7.4(d)(vi) of the Plan. 

(v)   Timing of Award Payments    

Performance Compensation
Awards granted for a Performance Period shall be paid to Participants as soon as administratively practicable following completion
of the certifications required by this Section 7.4 but in no event later than 2 1/2 months following the end of the fiscal year
during which the Performance Period is completed. 

(vi)   Maximum Award Payable    

Notwithstanding any
provision contained in this Plan to the contrary, the maximum Performance Compensation Award payable to any one Participant under
the Plan for a Performance Period (excluding any Options and Stock Appreciation Rights) is 500,000 shares of Common Stock or, in
the event such Performance Compensation Award is paid in cash, the equivalent cash value thereof on the first or last day of the
Performance Period to which such Award relates, as determined by the Committee. The maximum amount that can be paid in any calendar
year to any Participant pursuant to a cash bonus Award described in the last sentence of Section 7.4(a) shall be $1,000,000. Furthermore,
any Performance Compensation Award that has been deferred shall not (between the date as of which the Award is deferred and the
payment date) increase (A) with respect to a Performance Compensation Award that is payable in cash, by a measuring factor for
each fiscal year greater than a reasonable rate of interest set by the Committee or (B) with respect to a Performance Compensation
Award that is payable in shares of Common Stock, by an amount greater than the appreciation of a share of Common Stock from the
date such Award is deferred to the payment date. 

8.       Securities
Law Compliance . Each Award Agreement shall provide that no shares of Common Stock shall be purchased or sold thereunder unless
and until (a) any then applicable requirements of state or federal laws and regulatory agencies have been fully complied with to
the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel and (b) if required to do so by the Company, the Participant has executed and delivered
to the Company a letter of investment intent in such form and containing such provisions as the Committee may require. The Company
shall use reasonable efforts to seek to obtain from each regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction over the Plan such
authority as may be required to grant Awards and to issue and sell shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Awards;  provided,
however , that this undertaking shall not require the Company to register under the Securities Act the Plan, any Award or any
Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to any such Award. If, after reasonable efforts, the Company is unable to obtain from
any such regulatory commission or agency the authority which counsel for the Company deems necessary for the lawful issuance and
sale of Common Stock under the Plan, the Company shall be relieved from any liability for failure to issue and sell Common Stock
upon exercise of such Awards unless and until such authority is obtained. 

9.       Use
of Proceeds from Stock . Proceeds from the sale of Common Stock pursuant to Awards, or upon exercise thereof, shall constitute
general funds of the Company. 

10.     Miscellaneous . 

10.1        Acceleration
of Exercisability and Vesting . The Committee shall have the power to accelerate the time at which an Award may first be exercised
or the time during which an Award or any part thereof will vest in accordance with the Plan, notwithstanding the provisions in
the Award stating the time at which it may first be exercised or the time during which it will vest. 

10.2        Shareholder
Rights . Except as provided in the Plan or an Award Agreement, no Participant shall be deemed to be the holder of, or to have
any of the rights of a holder with respect to, any shares of Common Stock subject to such Award unless and until such Participant
has satisfied all requirements for exercise of the Award pursuant to its terms and no adjustment shall be made for dividends (ordinary
or extraordinary, whether in cash, securities or other property) or distributions of other rights for which the record date is
prior to the date such Common Stock certificate is issued, except as provided in   Section  11  hereof. 

10.3        No
Employment or Other Service Rights . Nothing in the Plan or any instrument executed or Award granted pursuant thereto shall
confer upon any Participant any right to continue to serve the Company or an Affiliate in the capacity in effect at the time the
Award was granted or shall affect the right of the Company or an Affiliate to terminate (a) the employment of an Employee with
or without notice and with or without Cause or (b) the service of a Director pursuant to the By-laws of the Company or an Affiliate,
and any applicable provisions of the corporate law of the state in which the Company or the Affiliate is incorporated, as the case
may be. 

10.4        Transfer;
Approved Leave of Absence . For purposes of the Plan, no termination of employment by an Employee shall be deemed to result
from either (a) a transfer of employment to the Company from an Affiliate or from the Company to an Affiliate, or from one Affiliate
to another, or (b) an approved leave of absence for military service or sickness, or for any other purpose approved by the Company,
if the Employee s right to reemployment is guaranteed either by a statute or by contract or under the policy pursuant to
which the leave of absence was granted or if the Committee otherwise so provides in writing, in either case, except to the extent
inconsistent with Section 409A of the Code if the applicable Award is subject thereto. 

10.5        Withholding
Obligations . To the extent provided by the terms of an Award Agreement and subject to the discretion of the Committee, the
Participant may satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise or acquisition of Common
Stock under an Award by any of the following means (in addition to the Company s right to withhold from any compensation
paid to the Participant by the Company) or by a combination of such means: (a) tendering a cash payment; (b) authorizing the Company
to withhold shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Participant as a result of the exercise
or acquisition of Common Stock under the Award,  provided, however , that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value
exceeding the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld by law; or (c) delivering to the Company previously owned and unencumbered
shares of Common Stock of the Company. 

11.      Adjustments
Upon Changes in Stock . In the event of changes in the outstanding Common Stock or in the capital structure of the Company by
reason of any stock or extraordinary cash dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, an extraordinary corporate transaction such
as any recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, combination, exchange, or other relevant change in capitalization
occurring after the Grant Date of any Award, Awards granted under the Plan and any Award Agreements, the exercise price of Options
and Stock Appreciation Rights, the maximum number of shares of Common Stock subject to all Awards stated in   Section  4 
and the maximum number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which any one person may be granted Awards during any period stated
in   Section  4  and  Section 7.4(d)(vi)  will be equitably adjusted or substituted, as to the number, price or
kind of a share of Common Stock or other consideration subject to such Awards to the extent necessary to preserve the economic
intent of such Award. In the case of adjustments made pursuant to this Section 11, unless the Committee specifically determines
that such adjustment is in the best interests of the Company or its Affiliates, the Committee shall, in the case of Incentive Stock
Options, ensure that any adjustments under this Section 11 will not constitute a modification, extension or renewal of the Incentive
Stock Options within the meaning of Section 424(h)(3) of the Code and in the case of Non-qualified Stock Options, ensure that any
adjustments under this Section 11 will not constitute a modification of such Non-qualified Stock Options within the meaning of
Section 409A of the Code. Any adjustments made under this Section 11 shall be made in a manner which does not adversely affect
the exemption provided pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act. Further, with respect to Awards intended to qualify as  performance-based
compensation  under Section 162(m) of the Code, any adjustments or substitutions will not cause the Company to be denied
a tax deduction on account of Section 162(m) of the Code. The Company shall give each Participant notice of an adjustment hereunder
and, upon notice, such adjustment shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes. 

12.     Effect
of Change in Control . 

12.1       Unless
otherwise provided in an Award Agreement, notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary: 

(a)       In
the event of a Change of Control, all Options and Stock Appreciation Rights shall become immediately exercisable with respect to
100% of the shares subject to such Options or Stock Appreciation Rights, and/or the Restricted Period shall expire immediately
with respect to 100% of the shares of Restricted Stock or Restricted Stock Units. 

(b)       With
respect to Performance Compensation Awards, in the event of a Change in Control, all incomplete Performance Periods in respect
of such Award in effect on the date the Change in Control occurs shall end on the date of such change and the Committee shall (i)
determine the extent to which Performance Goals with respect to each such Performance Period have been met based upon such audited
or unaudited financial information then available as it deems relevant and (ii) cause to be paid to the applicable Participant
partial or full Awards with respect to Performance Goals for each such Performance Period based upon the Committee's determination
of the degree of attainment of Performance Goals or, if not determinable, assuming that the applicable  target  levels
of performance have been attained, or on such other basis determined by the Committee. 

To the extent practicable,
any actions taken by the Committee under the immediately preceding clauses (a) and (b) shall occur in a manner and at a time which
allows affected Participants the ability to participate in the Change in Control with respect to the shares of Common Stock subject
to their Awards. 

12.2  In
addition, in the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may in its discretion and upon at least 10 days  advance notice
to the affected persons, cancel any outstanding Awards and pay to the holders thereof, in cash or stock, or any combination thereof,
the value of such Awards based upon the price per share of Common Stock received or to be received by other shareholders of the
Company in the event. In the case of any Option or Stock Appreciation Right with an exercise price that equals or exceeds the price
paid for a share of Common Stock in connection with the Change in Control, the Committee may cancel the Option or Stock Appreciation
Right without the payment of consideration therefor. 

12.3  The
obligations of the Company under the Plan shall be binding upon any successor corporation or organization resulting from the merger,
consolidation or other reorganization of the Company, or upon any successor corporation or organization succeeding to all or substantially
all of the assets and business of the Company and its Affiliates, taken as a whole. 

13.     Amendment

of Plan . The Board at any time, and from time to time, may amend or terminate the Plan. However, except as provided in   Section
 11  relating to adjustments upon changes in Common Stock and   Section  13.3 , no amendment shall be effective
unless approved by the shareholders of the Company to the extent shareholder approval is necessary to satisfy any Applicable Laws.
At the time of such amendment, the Board shall determine, upon advice from counsel, whether such amendment will be contingent on
shareholder approval. 

13.2   Shareholder
Approval . The Board may, in its sole discretion, submit any other amendment to the Plan for shareholder approval, including,
but not limited to, amendments to the Plan intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations
thereunder regarding the exclusion of performance-based compensation from the limit on corporate deductibility of compensation
paid to certain executive officers. 

13.3    Contemplated
Amendments . It is expressly contemplated that the Board may amend the Plan in any respect the Board deems necessary or advisable
to provide eligible Employees, Consultants and Directors with the maximum benefits provided or to be provided under the provisions
of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder relating to Incentive Stock Options or to the nonqualified deferred compensation
provisions of Section 409A of the Code and/or to bring the Plan and/or Awards granted under it into compliance therewith. 

13.4    No
Impairment of Rights . Rights under any Award granted before amendment of the Plan shall not be impaired by any amendment of
the Plan unless (a) the Company requests the consent of the Participant and (b) the Participant consents in writing. 

13.5    Amendment
of Awards . The Committee at any time, and from time to time, may amend the terms of any one or more Awards;  provided, however ,
that the Committee may not affect any amendment which would otherwise constitute an impairment of the rights under any Award unless
(a) the Company requests the consent of the Participant and (b) the Participant consents in writing. 

14.     General
Provisions . 

14.1    Forfeiture
Events . The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant s rights, payments and benefits with respect
to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain events, in addition
to applicable vesting conditions of an Award. Such events may include, without limitation, breach of non-competition, non-solicitation,
confidentiality, or other restrictive covenants that are contained in the Award Agreement or otherwise applicable to the Participant,
a termination of the Participant s Continuous Service for Cause, or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental
to the business or reputation of the Company and/or its Affiliates. 

14.2    Clawback .
Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Plan, any Award which is subject to recovery under any law, government regulation
or stock exchange listing requirement, will be subject to such deductions and clawback as may be required to be made pursuant to
such law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement (or any policy adopted by the Company pursuant to any such
law, government regulation or stock exchange listing requirement). 

14.3    Other
Compensation Arrangements . Nothing contained in this Plan shall prevent the Board from adopting other or additional compensation
arrangements, subject to shareholder approval if such approval is required; and such arrangements may be either generally applicable
or applicable only in specific cases. 

14.4    Sub-plans .
The Committee may from time to time establish sub-plans under the Plan for purposes of satisfying blue sky, securities, tax or
other laws of various jurisdictions in which the Company intends to grant Awards. Any sub-plans shall contain such limitations
and other terms and conditions as the Committee determines are necessary or desirable. All sub-plans shall be deemed a part of
the Plan, but each sub-plan shall apply only to the Participants in the jurisdiction for which the sub-plan was designed. 

14.5     Deferral
of Awards . The Committee may establish one or more programs under the Plan to permit selected Participants the opportunity
to elect to defer receipt of consideration upon exercise of an Award, satisfaction of performance criteria, or other event that
absent the election would entitle the Participant to payment or receipt of shares of Common Stock or other consideration under
an Award. The Committee may establish the election procedures, the timing of such elections, the mechanisms for payments of, and
accrual of interest or other earnings, if any, on amounts, shares or other consideration so deferred, and such other terms, conditions,
rules and procedures that the Committee deems advisable for the administration of any such deferral program. 

14.6     Unfunded
Plan . The Plan shall be unfunded. Neither the Company, the Board nor the Committee shall be required to establish any special
or separate fund or to segregate any assets to assure the performance of its obligations under the Plan. 

14.7     Recapitalizations .
Each Award Agreement shall contain provisions required to reflect the provisions of   Section  11 . 

14.8     Delivery .
Upon exercise of a right granted under this Plan, the Company shall issue Common Stock or pay any amounts due within a reasonable
period of time thereafter. Subject to any statutory or regulatory obligations the Company may otherwise have, for purposes of this
Plan, 30 days shall be considered a reasonable period of time. 

14.9     No
Fractional Shares . No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan. The Committee shall
determine whether cash, additional Awards or other securities or property shall be issued or paid in lieu of fractional shares
of Common Stock or whether any fractional shares should be rounded, forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 

14.10   Other
Provisions . The Award Agreements authorized under the Plan may contain such other provisions not inconsistent with this Plan,
including, without limitation, restrictions upon the exercise of the Awards, as the Committee may deem advisable. 

14.11   Section
409A . The Plan is intended to comply with Section 409A of the Code to the extent subject thereto, and, accordingly, to the
maximum extent permitted, the Plan shall be interpreted and administered to be in compliance therewith. Any payments described
in the Plan that are due within the  short-term deferral period  as defined in Section 409A of the Code shall not be
treated as deferred compensation unless Applicable Laws require otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Plan,
to the extent required to avoid accelerated taxation and tax penalties under Section 409A of the Code, amounts that would otherwise
be payable and benefits that would otherwise be provided pursuant to the Plan during the six (6) month period immediately following
the Participant s termination of Continuous Service shall instead be paid on the first payroll date after the six-month anniversary
of the Participant s separation from service (or the Participant s death, if earlier). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
neither the Company nor the Committee shall have any obligation to take any action to prevent the assessment of any excise tax
or penalty on any Participant under Section 409A of the Code and neither the Company nor the Committee will have any liability
to any Participant for such tax or penalty. 

14.12    Disqualifying
Dispositions . Any Participant who shall make a  disposition  (as defined in Section 424 of the Code) of all or
any portion of shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of an Incentive Stock Option within two years from the Grant Date
of such Incentive Stock Option or within one year after the issuance of the shares of Common Stock acquired upon exercise of such
Incentive Stock Option (a   Disqualifying Disposition  ) shall be required to immediately advise the Company in
writing as to the occurrence of the sale and the price realized upon the sale of such shares of Common Stock. 

14.13    Section
16 . It is the intent of the Company that the Plan satisfy, and be interpreted in a manner that satisfies, the applicable requirements
of Rule 16b-3 as promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act so that Participants will be entitled to the benefit of Rule
16b-3, or any other rule promulgated under Section 16 of the Exchange Act, and will not be subject to short-swing liability under
Section 16 of the Exchange Act. Accordingly, if the operation of any provision of the Plan would conflict with the intent expressed
in this   Section  14.13 , such provision to the extent possible shall be interpreted and/or deemed amended so as to
avoid such conflict. 

14.14    Section
162(m) . To the extent the Committee issues any Award that is intended to be exempt from the deduction limitation of Section
162(m) of the Code, the Committee may, without shareholder or grantee approval, amend the Plan or the relevant Award Agreement
retroactively or prospectively to the extent it determines necessary in order to comply with any subsequent clarification of Section
162(m) of the Code required to preserve the Company s federal income tax deduction for compensation paid pursuant to any
such Award. 

14.15    Beneficiary
Designation . Each Participant under the Plan may from time to time name any beneficiary or beneficiaries by whom any right
under the Plan is to be exercised in case of such Participant s death. Each designation will revoke all prior designations

Participant in writing with the Company during the Participant s lifetime. 

14.16    Expenses .
The costs of administering the Plan shall be paid by the Company.

If any of the provisions of the Plan or any Award Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, whether in whole or
in part, such provision shall be deemed modified to the extent, but only to the extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
and the remaining provisions shall not be affected thereby. 

14.18    Plan
Headings . The headings in the Plan are for purposes of convenience only and are not intended to define or limit the construction
of the provisions hereof. 

14.19    Non-Uniform
Treatment . The Committee s determinations under the Plan need not be uniform and may be made by it selectively among
persons who are eligible to receive, or actually receive, Awards. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Committee
shall be entitled to make non-uniform and selective determinations, amendments and adjustments, and to enter into non-uniform and
selective Award Agreements. 

15.    Effective
Date of Plan . The Plan shall become effective as of the Effective Date, but no Award shall be exercised (or, in the case of
a stock Award, shall be granted) unless and until the Plan has been approved by the shareholders of the Company, which approval
shall be within twelve (12) months before or after the date the Plan is adopted by the Board. 

16.     Termination
or Suspension of the Plan . The Plan shall terminate automatically on the tenth anniversary of the Effective Date. No Award
shall be granted pursuant to the Plan after such date, but Awards theretofore granted may extend beyond that date. The Board may
suspend or terminate the Plan at any earlier date pursuant to   Section  13.1  hereof. No Awards may be granted under
the Plan while the Plan is suspended or after it is terminated. Unless the Company determines to submit   Section  7.4 
of the Plan and the definition of  Performance Goal  and  Performance Criteria  to the Company's shareholders
at the first shareholder meeting that occurs in the fifth year following the year in which the Plan was last approved by shareholders
(or any earlier meeting designated by the Board), in accordance with the requirements of Section 162(m) of the Code, and such shareholder
approval is obtained, then no further Performance Compensation Awards shall be made to Covered Employees under   Section 
7.4  after the date of such annual meeting, but the Plan may continue in effect for Awards to Participants not in accordance
with Section 162(m) of the Code 

17.     Choice
of Law . The law of the State of Nevada shall govern all questions concerning the construction, validity and interpretation
of this Plan, without regard to such state s conflict of law rules.

number of shares of Common Stock of the Company equal to the number of Option Shares set forth above, at the Exercise Price set
forth above. The Option is being granted pursuant to the terms of the Company s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the   Plan  ).

Stock Option. To the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value (determined on the Grant Date) of the shares of Common Stock
with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first time by the Participant during any calendar year (under
all plans of the Company and its Affiliates) exceeds $100,000, the Options or portions thereof which exceed such limit (according
to the order in which they were granted) shall be treated as Non-qualified Stock Options. If the Type of Option set forth above
is an NSO, the Option is intended to be a Non-qualified Stock Option and  not  an Incentive Stock Option within the meaning
of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code. 

1.2      Consideration;
Subject to Plan . The grant of the Option is made in consideration of the services to be rendered by the Participant to the
Company and is subject to the terms and conditions of the Plan. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein will have the meaning

2.1      Vesting
Schedule . The Option will become vested and exercisable according to the following schedule: [one-fourth (1/4 th )
of the shares subject to the Option shall vest one year following the date that the Option commences vesting as specified at the
time of grant, or, if no date is specified at the time of grant, the Grant Date (such date for such Option, the   Vesting
Commencement Date  ), and the balance of the shares subject to the Option shall vest in a series of thirty-six (36) successive
equal monthly installments measured from the first anniversary of the Vesting Commencement Date, subject to Optionholder s
Continuous Service as of each such date, until the Option is 100% vested]. The unvested portion of the Option will not be exercisable
on or after the Participant s termination of Continuous Service. 

2.2      Expiration .
The Option will expire on the Expiration Date set forth above, or earlier as provided in this Agreement or the Plan. 

3.       Termination
of Continuous Service . 

3.1      Termination
for Reasons Other Than Cause, Death, Disability . If the Participant s Continuous Service is terminated for any reason
other than Cause, death or Disability, the Participant may exercise the vested portion of the Option, but only within such period
of time ending on the earlier of: (a) the date three months following the termination of the Participant s Continuous Service
or (b) the Expiration Date. 

3.2      Termination
for Cause . If the Participant s Continuous Service is terminated for Cause, the Option (whether vested or unvested)
shall immediately terminate and cease to be exercisable. 

3.3      Termination
Due to Disability . If the Participant s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant s Disability,
the Participant may exercise the vested portion of the Option, but only within such period of time ending on the earlier of: (a)
the date 12 months following the Participant s termination of Continuous Service or (b) the Expiration Date. 

3.4      Termination
Due to Death . If the Participant s Continuous Service terminates as a result of the Participant s death, the vested
portion of the Option may be exercised by the Participant s estate, by a person who acquired the right to exercise the Option
by bequest or inheritance or by the person designated to exercise the Option upon the Participant s death, but only within
the time period ending on the earlier of: (a) the date 12 months following the Participant s termination of Continuous Service
or (b) the Expiration Date. 

3.5      Extension
of Termination Date . Unless the Option is an Incentive Stock Option, if following the Participant s termination of Continuous
Service for any reason the exercise of the Option is prohibited because the exercise of the Option would violate the registration
requirements under the Securities Act or any other state or federal securities law or the rules of any securities exchange or
interdealer quotation system, then the expiration of the Option shall be tolled until the date that is thirty (30) days after
the end of the period during which the exercise of the Option would be in violation of such registration or other securities requirements. 

4.       Manner
of Exercise . 

4.1      Election
to Exercise . To exercise the Option, the Participant (or in the case of exercise after the Participant s death or incapacity,
the Participant s executor, administrator, heir or legatee, as the case may be) must deliver to the Company a notice of
intent to exercise in substantially the form attached hereto as  Exhibit A  (the   Exercise Notice  ). 

If someone other than
the Participant exercises the Option, then such person must submit documentation reasonably acceptable to the Company verifying
that such person has the legal right to exercise the Option. 

4.2      Payment
of Exercise Price . The entire Exercise Price of the Option shall be payable in full at the time of exercise to the extent
permitted by applicable statutes and regulations, either: 

(a)       in
cash or by certified or bank check at the time the Option is exercised; 

(b)       by
delivery to the Company of other shares of Common Stock, duly endorsed for transfer to the Company, with a Fair Market Value on
the date of delivery equal to the Exercise Price (or portion thereof) due for the number of shares being acquired, or by means
of attestation whereby the Participant identifies for delivery specific shares that have a Fair Market Value on the date of attestation
equal to the Exercise Price (or portion thereof) and receives a number of shares equal to the difference between the number of
shares thereby purchased and the number of identified attestation shares (a   Stock for Stock Exchange  ); 

(c)       through
a  cashless exercise program  established with a broker; 

(d)       by
reduction in the number of shares otherwise deliverable upon exercise of such Option with a Fair Market Value equal to the aggregate
Exercise Price at the time of exercise; 

(e)       by
any combination of the foregoing methods; or 

(f)        in
any other form of legal consideration that may be acceptable to the Committee. 

4.3      Withholding .
If (i) the Option is an Incentive Stock Option and the Company, in its discretion, determines that it is obligated to withhold
any tax in connection with the exercise of the Option; or (ii) the Option is a Non-qualified Stock Option; prior to the issuance
of shares upon the exercise of the Option, the Participant must make arrangements satisfactory to the Company to pay or provide
for any applicable federal, state and local withholding obligations of the Company. The Participant may satisfy any federal, state
or local tax withholding obligation relating to the exercise of the Option by any of the following means: 

(a)       tendering
a cash payment; 

(b)       authorizing
the Company to withhold shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable to the Participant as a result
of the exercise of the Option;  provided, however , that no shares of Common Stock are withheld with a value exceeding the
minimum amount of tax required to be withheld by law; or 

(c)       delivering
to the Company previously owned and unencumbered shares of Common Stock. 

The Company has the
right to withhold from any compensation paid to a Participant. 

4.4     Issuance
of Shares . Provided that the Exercise Notice and payment are in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, the Company
shall issue the shares of Common Stock registered in the name of the Participant, the Participant s authorized assignee,
or the Participant s legal representative which shall be evidenced by stock certificates representing the shares with the
appropriate legends affixed thereto, appropriate entry on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent, or
other appropriate means as determined by the Company. 

5.       No
Right to Continued Employment; No Rights as Shareholder . Neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall confer upon the Participant
any right to be retained in any position, as an Employee, Consultant or Director of the Company. Further, nothing in the Plan
or this Agreement shall be construed to limit the discretion of the Company to terminate the Participant s Continuous Service
at any time, with or without Cause. The Participant shall not have any rights as a shareholder with respect to any shares of Common
Stock subject to the Option unless and until certificates representing the shares have been issued by the Company to the holder
of such shares, or the shares have otherwise been recorded on the books of the Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent
as owned by such holder. 

6.       Transferability .
The Option is not transferable by the Participant other than to a designated beneficiary upon the Participant s death or
by will or the laws of descent and distribution, and is exercisable during the Participant s lifetime only by him or her.
No assignment or transfer of the Option, or the rights represented thereby, whether voluntary or involuntary, by operation of
law or otherwise (except to a designated beneficiary, upon death, by will or the laws of descent or distribution) will vest in
the assignee or transferee any interest or right herein whatsoever, but immediately upon such assignment or transfer the Option
will terminate and become of no further effect. 

7.       Change
in Control . 

7.1      Acceleration
of Vesting . If a Change in Control occurs  and  the Participant s Continuous Service is terminated by the Company
without Cause (other than for death or Disability) or by the Participant for Good Reason within 12 months following the Change
in Control, 100% of the shares subject to the Option shall become immediately vested and exercisable. 

7.2      Cash-out .
In the event of a Change in Control, the Committee may, in its discretion and upon at least ten (10) days  advance notice
to the Participant, cancel the Option and pay to the Participant the value of the Option based upon the price per share of Common
Stock received or to be received by other shareholders of the Company in the event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at the time
of a Change in Control the Exercise Price of the Option equals or exceeds the price paid for a share of Common Stock in connection
with the Change in Control, the Committee may cancel the Option without the payment of consideration therefor. 

8.       Adjustments .
The shares of Common Stock subject to the Option may be adjusted or terminated in any manner as contemplated by Section 11 of
the Plan. 

9.       Tax
Liability and Withholding . Notwithstanding any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance,
payroll tax, or other tax-related withholding (  Tax-Related Items  ), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related
Items is and remains the Participant s responsibility and the Company (a) makes no representation or undertakings regarding
the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with the grant, vesting, or exercise of the Option or the subsequent sale
of any shares acquired on exercise; and (b) does not commit to structure the Option to reduce or eliminate the Participant s
liability for Tax-Related Items. 

10.     Qualification
as an Incentive Stock Option . If this Option is an Incentive Stock Option, it is understood that this Option is intended to
qualify as an incentive stock option as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent permitted under Applicable Law. Accordingly,
the Participant understands that in order to obtain the benefits of an incentive stock option, no sale or other disposition may
be made of shares for which incentive stock option treatment is desired within one (1) year following the date of exercise of
the Option or within two (2) years from the Grant Date. The Participant understands and agrees that the Company shall not be liable
or responsible for any additional tax liability the Participant incurs in the event that the Internal Revenue Service for any
reason determines that this Option does not qualify as an incentive stock option within the meaning of the Code. 

11.     Disqualifying
Disposition . If this Option is an Incentive Stock Option and the Participant disposes of the shares of Common Stock prior
to the expiration of either two (2) years from the Grant Date or one (1) year from the date the shares are transferred to the
Participant pursuant to the exercise of the Option (a   Disqualifying Disposition  ), the Participant shall notify
the Company in writing within thirty (30) days after such disposition of the date and terms of such disposition. The Participant
also agrees to provide the Company with any information concerning any such dispositions as the Company requires for tax purposes. 

12.     [Reserved] . 

13.     Compliance
with Law . The exercise of the Option and the issuance and transfer of shares of Common Stock shall be subject to compliance
by the Company and the Participant with all applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws and with all applicable
requirements of any stock exchange on which the Company s shares of Common Stock may be listed. No shares of Common Stock
shall be issued pursuant to this Option unless and until any then applicable requirements of state or federal laws and regulatory
agencies have been fully complied with to the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel. The Participant understands that the
Company is under no obligation to register the shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission, any state securities commission
or any stock exchange to effect such compliance. 

14.     Notices .

of the Company. Either party may designate another address in writing (or by such other method approved by the Company) from time
to time.

Law . This Agreement will be construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to
conflict of law principles.

for review. The resolution of such dispute by the Committee shall be final and binding on the Participant and the Company. 

17.     Options
Subject to Plan . This Agreement is subject to the Plan as approved by the Company s shareholders. The terms and provisions
of the Plan as it may be amended from time to time are hereby incorporated herein by reference. In the event of a conflict between

govern and prevail. 

18.     Successors
and Assigns . The Company may assign any of its rights under this Agreement. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the successors and assigns of the Company. Subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth herein, this Agreement
will be binding upon the Participant and the Participant s beneficiaries, executors, administrators and the person(s) to
whom this Agreement or this Option may be transferred by will or the laws of descent or distribution. 

19.     Severability .
The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of the Plan or this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability
of any other provision of the Plan or this Agreement, and each provision of the Plan and this Agreement shall be severable and
enforceable to the extent permitted by law. 

20.     Discretionary
Nature of Plan . The Plan is discretionary and may be amended, cancelled or terminated by the Company at any time, in its discretion.
The grant of the Option in this Agreement does not create any contractual right or other right to receive any Options or other
Awards in the future. Future Awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company. Any amendment, modification, or termination
of the Plan shall not constitute a change or impairment of the terms and conditions of the Participant s employment with

Restricted Stock Unit Agreement 

This Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (this
  Agreement  ) is made and entered into as of [DATE] (the   Grant Date  ) by and between Eastside
Distilling, a Nevada corporation (the   Company  ) and [NAME] (the   Grantee  ). 

WHEREAS , the Company has adopted
the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the   Plan  ) pursuant to which awards of Restricted Stock Units may be granted;
and 

WHEREAS , the Committee has determined
that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to grant the award of Restricted Stock Units provided for
herein. 

NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto, intending
to be legally bound, agree as follows: 

1.            Grant
of Restricted Stock Units  . 

1.1         Pursuant
to Section 7.2 of the Plan, the Company hereby issues to the Grantee on the Grant Date an Award consisting of, in the aggregate,
[NUMBER] Restricted Stock Units (the   Restricted Stock Units  ). Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right
to receive one share of Common Stock, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Plan. Capitalized
terms that are used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them in the Plan. 

1.2         The
Restricted Stock Units shall be credited to a separate account maintained for the Grantee on the books and records of the Company
(the   Account  ). All amounts credited to the Account shall continue for all purposes to be part of the general
assets of the Company. 

2.            Consideration  .
The grant of the Restricted Stock Units is made in consideration of the services to be rendered by the Grantee to the Company. 

3.            Vesting  . 

3.1         Except
as otherwise provided herein, provided that the Grantee remains in Continuous Service through the applicable vesting date, the
Restricted Stock Units will vest in accordance with the following schedule (the period during which restrictions apply, the   Restricted
Period  ): 

Vesting Date   
       Number of Restricted Stock Units That Vest    
 
      [DATE]  
      [NUMBER]   
 
      [DATE]  
      [NUMBER]   
 
      [DATE]  
      [NUMBER]   

Once vested,
the Restricted Stock Units become   Vested Units.   

3.2         The
foregoing vesting schedule notwithstanding, if the Grantee s Continuous Service terminates for any reason other than as a
result of Grantee s death or Disability at any time before all of his or her Restricted Stock Units have vested, the Grantee s
unvested Restricted Stock Units shall be automatically forfeited upon such termination of Continuous Service and neither the Company
nor any Affiliate shall have any further obligations to the Grantee under this Agreement. 

4.            Restrictions  .
Subject to any exceptions set forth in this Agreement or the Plan, during the Restricted Period and until such time as the Restricted
Stock Units are settled in accordance with Section 6, the Restricted Stock Units or the rights relating thereto may not be assigned,
alienated, pledged, attached, sold or otherwise transferred or encumbered by the Grantee. Any attempt to assign, alienate, pledge,
attach, sell or otherwise transfer or encumber the Restricted Stock Units or the rights relating thereto shall be wholly ineffective
and, if any such attempt is made, the Restricted Stock Units will be forfeited by the Grantee and all of the Grantee s rights
to such units shall immediately terminate without any payment or consideration by the Company. 

5.            Rights
as Shareholder; Dividend Equivalents  . 

5.1          The
Grantee shall not have any rights of a shareholder with respect to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Restricted Stock Units
unless and until the Restricted Stock Units vest and are settled by the issuance of such shares of Common Stock. 

5.2          Upon
and following the settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the Grantee shall be the record owner of the shares of Common Stock
underlying the Restricted Stock Units unless and until such shares are sold or otherwise disposed of, and as record owner shall
be entitled to all rights of a shareholder of the Company (including voting rights). 

5.3          The
Grantee shall not be entitled to any Dividend Equivalents with respect to the Restricted Stock Units to reflect any dividends payable
on shares of Common Stock. 

6.            Settlement
of Restricted Stock Units  . 

6.1          Subject
to Section 9 hereof, promptly following the vesting date, and in any event no later than March 15 of the calendar year following
the calendar year in which such vesting occurs, the Company shall (a) issue and deliver to the Grantee the number of shares of
Common Stock equal to the number of Vested Units; and (b) enter the Grantee s name on the books of the Company as the shareholder
of record with respect to the shares of Common Stock delivered to the Grantee. 

6.2          If

at a time when the Grantee becomes eligible for settlement of the RSUs upon his  separation from service  within the
meaning of Section 409A of the Code, then to the extent necessary to prevent any accelerated or additional tax under Section 409A
of the Code, such settlement will be delayed until the earlier of: (a) the date that is six months following the Grantee s
separation from service and (b) the Grantee s death. 

7.            No
Right to Continued Service  . Neither the Plan nor this Agreement shall confer upon the Grantee any right to be retained
in any position, as an Employee, Consultant or Director of the Company. Further, nothing in the Plan or this Agreement shall be
construed to limit the discretion of the Company to terminate the Grantee s Continuous Service at any time, with or without
Cause. 

8.            Adjustments  .
If any change is made to the outstanding Common Stock or the capital structure of the Company, if required, the Restricted Stock

all such other action as the Committee deems necessary to satisfy all obligations for the payment of such withholding taxes. The
Company may permit the Grantee to satisfy any federal, state or local tax withholding obligation by any of the following means,
or by a combination of such means:

a cash payment. 

(b)     authorizing
the Company to withhold shares of Common Stock from the shares of Common Stock otherwise issuable or deliverable to the Grantee

with a value exceeding the minimum amount of tax required to be withheld by law. 

(c)     delivering
to the Company previously owned and unencumbered shares of Common Stock. 

9.2          Notwithstanding
any action the Company takes with respect to any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, or other tax-related withholding
(  Tax-Related Items  ), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and remains the Grantee s responsibility
and the Company (a) makes no representation or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with
the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units or the subsequent sale of any shares; and (b) does not commit to
structure the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate the Grantee s liability for Tax-Related Items.

with Law  . The issuance and transfer of shares of Common Stock shall be subject to compliance by the Company and the
Grantee with all applicable requirements of federal and state securities laws and with all applicable requirements of any stock
exchange on which the Company s shares of Common Stock may be listed. No shares of Common Stock shall be issued or transferred
unless and until any then applicable requirements of state and federal laws and regulatory agencies have been fully complied with
to the satisfaction of the Company and its counsel.
