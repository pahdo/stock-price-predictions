Note
1 - Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America and the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for interim
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they may not include
all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position, results of operations or cash
flows. It is management s opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) have
been made which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation.  

The
unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report filed on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto, together with Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Nature
of Operations   

The
Virtual Learning Company, Inc. ( Virtual Learning ) was incorporated on January 6, 2009 as a Nevada corporation with
75,000,000 shares of capital stock authorized, of which 70,000,000 shares are common shares ($.001 par value), and 5,000,000 shares
are preferred shares ($.001 par value).  

Virtual
Learning has been a subscription based software as a service ( SaaS ) provider of education products. Virtual Learning
provides standards-based instruction, practice, assessments, and productivity tools that improve the performance of educators
and students via proprietary web-based platforms at www.mathisbasic.com, www.scienceisbasic.com and www.readingisbasic.com.  

Virtual
Learning is also a producer of a series of practice workbooks published on CD, DVD formatted disc and USB Drives and in the ePub
format which have been offered for sale through Barnes and Noble s Nook and Amazon s Kindle since 2012.  

Newly
Acquired Construction Business   

On
August 19, 2016, Virtual Learning acquired 4.5% of Dream Homes,Ltd. ( DHL ), 100% of Dream Building, LLC ( DBL )
, a wholly owned subsidiary of DHL, and use of all construction licensing and registrations held by Atlantic Northeast Construction
LLC ( ANCL ), a wholly owned subsidiary of DHL, in exchange for the issuance of 2,225,000 restricted shares of Virtual
Learning common stock to DHL at an agreed price of $.05 per common share.  

The
majority stockholder and chief executive officer of DHL is also the controlling stockholder and chief executive officer of Virtual
Learning. As Virtual Learning and DHL were entities under common control, the acquired assets were reflected by Virtual Learning
at DHL s $0 carrying amount on the date of transfer pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805-50-30-5.  

From
August 19, 2016 to August 23, 2016, Virtual Learning acquired the rights to complete 6 in process construction contracts of ANCL
in exchange for the issuance of 2,287,367 restricted shares of Virtual Learning common stock to DHL at an agreed price of $.05
per common share for those ANCL contracts. As Virtual Learning and DHL were entities under common control, the acquired rights
were reflected at DHL s $0 carrying amount on the date of transfer pursuant to ASC 805-50-30-5.  

Going
Concern Uncertainty    

These
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These standards contemplate continuation of Virtual Learning as a going concern.  

As
of September 30, 2016, Virtual Learning had $61,193 cash and negative working capital of $81,152. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, Virtual Learning had revenues of $58,998 and $75, respectively, and sustained net losses of $44,680 and $142,666,
respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt about Virtual Learning s ability to continue as a going concern. Virtual
Learning has also unamortized capitalized stock-based and contributed curriculum development costs of $28,234 as of September
30, 2016. The recovery of these asset costs and continuation of future operations will be dependent upon Virtual Learning s
ability to obtain additional debt or equity capital and its ability to generate revenues sufficient to continue pursuit of its
business purposes. Virtual Learning is actively seeking financing to fund future operations.  

Virtual
Learning is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other development stage enterprises. These risks include, but are
not limited to, rapid technological change, dependence on key personnel, competing new product introductions and other activities
of competitors, the successful development and marketing of its products, and the need to obtain adequate additional capital necessary
to fund future operations.  

There
is no assurance that Virtual Learning can reverse its operating losses, or that it can raise additional capital to allow it to
continue its planned future operations. These factors raise additional substantial doubt about Virtual Learning s ability
to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded
asset amounts that might be necessary from an unfavorable resolution of this uncertainty.  

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Virtual Learning and its wholly owned subsidiary DBL (collectively,
the  Company ). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Property
and Equipment    

Property
and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over an
estimated useful life of five years. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred, and renewals and betterments are
capitalized.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles .generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements
and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

All
liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents; all
liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months are classified as short-term investments.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

Fair
value is defined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly
transaction between market participants on the measurement date. In determining fair value, GAAP establishes a three-level hierarchy
used in measuring fair value, as follows:  

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices available for identical assets and liabilities in active markets.  

Level 2 inputs are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets
and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.  

Level 3 inputs are less observable and reflect our own assumptions.  

Our
financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses and convertible
notes payable and accrued interest. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable and accrued
expenses approximates fair value because of their short maturities. The carrying value of the convertible notes payable and accrued
interest approximates fair value based on the value of comparable financial instruments with similar terms. We may adjust the
carrying amount of certain nonfinancial assets to fair value on a non-recurring basis when they are impaired. No such adjustments
were made for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Construction
Contracts    

Revenue
recognition:  

The
Company and its affiliated entities recognize construction contract revenue using the percentage-of-completion method, based primarily
on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost. Cost of revenue includes an allocation of depreciation,
amortization and general overhead cost. Changes to total estimated contract cost or losses, if any, are recognized in the period
in which they are determined.  

The
Company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its construction contracts with periods typically extending
for a limited duration following substantial completion of the Company s work on a  

  project.  

The
Company classifies construction-related receivables and payables that may be settled in periods exceeding one year from the balance
sheet date, if any, as current assets and liabilities consistent with the length of time of its project operating cycle. For example:  

Costs
    and estimated earnings in excess of billings represent the excess of contract costs and profits (or contract revenue) over
    the amount of contract billings to date and are classified as a current asset.   

Billings
    in excess of costs and estimated earnings represent the excess of contract billings to date over the amount of contract costs
    and profits (or contract revenue) recognized to date and are classified as a current liability.   

Costs
and estimated earnings in excess of billings result when either: 1) costs are incurred related to certain claims and unapproved
change orders, or 2) the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentage-of-completion
accounting method, but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract.
Claims occur when there is a dispute regarding both a change in the scope of work and the price associated with that change. Unapproved
change orders occur when there is a dispute regarding only the price associated with a change in scope of work. For both claims
and unapproved change orders, the Company recognizes revenue, but not profit, when it is determined that recovery of incurred
cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated.  

Change
in Estimates:  

The
Company s estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed and many factors change during a contract performance
period that result in a change to contract profitability. These factors include, but are not limited to, differing site conditions:
availability of skilled contract labor: performance of major material suppliers and subcontractors: on-going subcontractor negotiations
and buyout provisions: unusual weather conditions: changes in the timing of scheduled work: change orders: accuracy of the original
bid estimate: changes in estimated labor productivity and costs based on experience to date: achievement of incentive-based income
targets: and the expected, or actual, resolution terms for claims. The factors that cause changes in estimates vary depending
on the maturation of the project within its lifecycle. For example, in the ramp-up phase, these factors typically consist of revisions
in anticipated project costs and during the peak and close-out phases, these fators include the impact of change orders and claims
as well as additional revisions in remaining anticipated project costs. Generally, if the contract is at an early stage of completion,
the current period impact is smaller than if the same change in estimate is made to the contract at a later stage of completion.
Management focuses on evaluating the performance of contracts individually and uses the cumulative catch-up method to account
for revisions in estimates. Material changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.  

Educational
Software and Products    

Revenue
Recognition:  

Revenue
is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied: there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the customer
has access to full use of the product, the collection is reasonably assured, and the amount to be paid by the customer is fixed
or determinable.  

Revenue
generated from the Company s subscription based learning service is recognized when all of the following conditions are
satisfied: there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the customer has access to full use of the product, the collection
is reasonably assured, and the amount to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable.  

Revenue
from customer subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription term beginning on the commencement date of each subscription.
The average subscription term is twelve (12) months for our products, and all subscriptions are on a non-cancelable basis. When
additional months are offered as a promotional incentive, those months are part of the subscription term. As part of their subscriptions,
customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost.  

Although
our membership contracts are generally non-cancelable, customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing prior written
notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term. In the event a customer cancels their contract, they
are not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them.  

Customer
support is provided to customers following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal cost per call.  

Virtual
Learning does not incur significant up-front costs related to providing its products and services and therefore does not defer
any expenses.  

Revenue
from the sale of CD s or DVD s and other materials is recognized when shipped or available to the customer in a downloadable
format.  

Capitalized
Curriculum Development Costs     

Virtual
Learning has internally developed curriculum, which is primarily offered as web content and accessed via the Internet. Virtual
Learning also creates textbooks and other offline materials.  

Virtual
Learning has capitalized curriculum development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles provide guidance for the treatment of costs associated
with computer software development and defines those costs to be capitalized and those to be expensed. Costs that qualify for
capitalization are external direct costs, payroll, and   payroll-related
expenses. Costs related to general and administrative functions are not capitalized and are expensed as incurred. Virtual Learning
has capitalized curriculum development costs when the projects under development have reached technological feasibility. Many
of our courses are leveraged off proven delivery platforms and are primarily content, which has no technological hurdles. As a
result, a significant portion of our courseware development costs have qualified for capitalization due to the concentration of
our development efforts on the content of the courseware.  

Technological
feasibility is established when we have completed all planning, designing, coding, and testing activities necessary to establish
that a course can be produced to meet its design specifications. Capitalization ends when a course is available for general release
to our customers, at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins. The period of time over which these development
costs have been amortized is five years. This is consistent with the capitalization period used by others in our industry and
corresponds with our product development lifecycle.  

Virtual
Learning tests for impairment annually. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s estimates of future undiscounted
cash flows from the courses exceeded the carrying amounts of the capitalized curriculum development costs ($28,234 and $51,334,
respectively) and therefore no impairment was recognized.  

Income
Taxes    

Virtual
Learning accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting
purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the provision for income
tax in the statements of operations. Virtual Learning evaluates the probability of realizing the future benefits of its deferred
tax assets and provides a valuation allowance when realization of the assets is not reasonably assured.  

Virtual
Learning recognizes in its financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a  more likely than not  threshold,
based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such a position are measured based on the largest
benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.  

Net
Income (Loss) Per Common Share    

Basic
net income (basic net loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period.  

Diluted
net income (loss) per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and potentially
dilutive securities outstanding during the period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the 317,485 and 279,970
shares of common stock underlying the $63,497 and $55,994 balances of convertible notes payable and accrued interest at September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were excluded from the calculation of diluted shares outstanding as their inclusion would be
antidilutive.  

Reclassifications    

The
statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and the statement of cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 have been reclassified to conform with current period presentation.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Accounting Standards Codification  ASC  Topic 606). The purpose
of this ASU is to converge revenue recognition requirements per GAAP and International Financial  

Reporting
Standards ( IFRS ). The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer
of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled
in exchange for those goods or services. The amendments in this ASU are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, with early adoption not permitted by the FASB; however, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date after public comment respondents supported a
proposal to delay the effective date of this ASU to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our financial position,
results of operations and cash flows.  

In
September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,  Business Combinations: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments, 
which requires acquirers to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts identified during the reporting period in which the adjustment
amounts are determined. Acquirers should record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes
in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated
as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Application of the standard, which should be applied prospectively,
is required for the annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We do not believe that adoption has had or will
have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The core principle of the standard is that a
lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in its statement of financial
position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying
asset for the lease term. We will be required to adopt the new standard in the first quarter of 2019. We are currently evaluating
the impact this new standard will have on our financial statements.  

Certain
other accounting pronouncements have been issued by the FASB and other standard setting organizations which are not yet effective
and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Company. The impact on the Company s financial position and results of operations
from adoption of these standards is not expected to be material.

Capitalized
curriculum development costs is summarized as follows:  

As
described in Note 1 above, amortization of the capitalized curriculum development costs begins when the courses become available
for sale to customers (which occurred in September 2012).  

Virtual
Learning tests for impairment annually. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s estimates of future undiscounted
cash flows from the courses exceeded the carrying amounts of the capitalized curriculum development costs ($28,234 and $51,334,
respectively) and therefore no impairment was recognized.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amortization of Capitalized Curriculum Development Costs were $23,100 and $24,600,
respectively.  

At
September 30, 2016, expected future amortization expense of Capitalized Curriculum Development Costs follows:

  Income Taxes   

The
provisions for (benefit from) income taxes differ from the amounts computed by applying the statutory United States Federal income
tax rate of 35% to income (loss) before income taxes.  

The
sources of the differences follow:  

The
significant components of Virtual Learning s deferred tax asset as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:  

Based
on management s present assessment, the Company has not yet determined it to be more likely than not that a deferred tax
asset of $46,656 attributable to the future utilization of $133,303 of net operating loss carryforwards will be realized. Accordingly,
the Company has maintained a 100% allowance against the deferred tax asset in the financial statements at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. The Company will continue to review this valuation allowance and make adjustments as appropriate. The net operating
loss carryforwards expire $672 in year 2029, $9,236 in year 2030, $41,526 in year 2031, $5,440 in year 2032, $1,840 in the year
2033, $17,025 in the year 2034, $42,650 in the year 2035, and $14,914 in the year 2036.  

Current
United States income tax law limits the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial
change in ownership occurs. Therefore, the amount available to offset future taxable income may be limited.  

The
Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109  ( FIN 48 ). This Interpretation clarifies accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in
an enterprise s financial statements. FIN 48 establishes guidelines for recognition and measurement of a tax position taken
or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company has not taken any tax   positions
and thus there is no impact as a result of the adoption of this interpretation. The Company reports interest and penalties associated
with its tax positions, if any, as interest expense.  

8-
Business Segments   

The
Company has two business segments: (1) educational software and products and  
 (2) residential construction. The educational software
and products segment is operated through Virtual Learning. The residential construction segment is operated through Virtual Learning s
wholly owned subsidiary Dream Building, LLC (since August 19, 2016).  

Summarized
financial information by business segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows:  

Identifiable
assets:  

All
revenue relating to the residential construction segment was derived from construction   contracts
involving homeowner customers located in the State of New Jersey. These contracts involve specialized construction related to
compromised home foundations and related issues caused by Super Storm Sandy damage.  

9-
Commitments and Contingencies

course of business. None of these construction projects are expected to take in excess of one year to complete. The Company has
no significant commitments with material suppliers or subcontractors that involve any sums of substance or are of long term duration
at the date of issuance of these financial statements.

September 15, 2016, Virtual Learning established a $50,000 line of credit with a nonbank lender. Advances under the line bear
interest at a rate of 12% payable monthly and the outstanding principal is due and payable in 60 months. The line is secured by
the personal guarantee of the Company s Chief Executive Officer. The agreement to fund automatically renews on a yearly
basis as long as interest payments are current. To date, the Company has not received any advances under the line of credit.

located within the current market area and are located in Brick, Ocean Gate and Toms River. The project in which additional items
were added to the scope of work is located in Lavallette and all of the projects are in Ocean County, NJ.  

ITEM
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other written reports and oral statements made from time to time by the Company may contain
so-called  forward-looking statements,  all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. One can identify these
forward-looking statements by their use of words such as  expect,   plan,   will,   may, 
 anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   should,   intend,   forecast, 
 project  the negative or plural of these words, and other comparable terminology. One can identify them by the fact
that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. These statements are likely to address the Company s growth
strategy, financial results and product and development programs. One must carefully consider any such statement and should understand
that many factors could cause actual results to differ from the Company s forward-looking statements. These factors may
include inaccurate assumptions and a broad variety of other risks and uncertainties, including some that are known and some that
are not. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual future results may vary materially. The Company does not assume
the obligation to update any forward-looking statement. One should carefully evaluate such statements in light of factors described
in the Company s filings with the SEC, especially the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K and the Company s
Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. In various filings the Company has identified important factors that could cause actual results
to differ from expected or historic results. One should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors.
Consequently, the reader should not consider any such list to be a complete list of all potential risks or uncertainties.  

Use
of Terms   

The
following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. Unless the context indicates or suggests otherwise, reference to  we ,  our ,  us  and
the  Company  in this section refers to the operations of The Virtual Learning Company and its wholly owned subsidiary
Dream Building, LLC.  

PLAN
OF OPERATION    

In
an effort to further expand the companies  revenue potential beyond that of the information field, Virtual Learning further
invested in a non-related business, through associations with several large shareholders in the Company. Virtual recognized that
the effects of Super Storm Sandy, which occurred on October 29, 2012 would be far reaching and cause an almost unlimited demand
for construction information, as well as specific construction services. Due to the damage caused by the storm, as well as the
material changes in the FEMA flood maps which   now require over
30,000 homeowners along the New Jersey coastline to elevate their homes, Virtual felt that acquiring an entity in the construction
field might provide a stable revenue stream for the company. Additionally, through its previous associations and long standing
professional relationships with Dream Homes Ltd., Virtual felt that Dream Homes educational division was an excellent fit with
the existing platform that Virtual has developed to market educational software and materials.  

As
such, Virtual Learning acquired though issuance of its common stock a business it will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Virtual Learning and pursue opportunities in the real estate field, specifically in new home construction and renovations. As
part of this effort, Virtual acquired the rights to complete 6 single family construction projects in the central NJ region, which
it will build to completion. Virtual Learning has also recently secured 2 additional home renovation and elevation contracts approximating
$300,000, bringing the total number of residential construction projects to 8 and bringing the aggregate total of signed contracts
under construction to approximately $1,500,000. Dream Building LLC has also provided estimates to homeowners for a potential additional
$2,300,000 worth of residential construction projects and added over 100 active prospects to its data base. All of these prospects
may be prime candidates for educational videos and short books on specific construction and rebuilding topics, as well as candidates
for rebuilding projects to be built under the Dream Building LLC subsidiary.  

Management
hopes for steady growth in this subsidiary of the company, since the rebuilding process will occur over the next 15-20 years.
We anticipate possibly being able to efficiently address 5% - 10% of this market.  The combined total number of homes affected
by Storm Sandy that will need to be raised or demolished and rebuilt is in excess of 30,000 homes, of which less than 3,000 have
been rebuilt. This remaining combined market for new construction and elevation projects in the Company s market area is
estimated to be in the range of $3.4 billion dollars.   

Dream
also held its bi-monthly Nearly Famous Rebuilding Seminar in September, which is a powerful educational tool for homeowners who
need rebuilding or renovations. This seminar offers unlimited potential for marketing short educational videos, as well as single
topic books regarding many aspects of construction and renovation. The revenue opportunities for this type of educational real
estate product will be greatly enhanced by Virtual s experience and existing software platforms.

Operating
expenses decreased $45,931 from $101,037 in 2015 to $55,106 in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the decrease of $37,500

Other
expenses-net decreased $34,471 from $41,704 in 2015 to $7,233 in 2016. The decrease was due primarily to the $32,500 decrease
in the amortization of debt discounts.
