HEALTH DISCOVERY CORPORATION  

Notes to Financial Statements (unaudited) 

Note A - BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

Health Discovery Corporation
(the  Company ) is a biotechnology-oriented company that has acquired patents and has patent pending applications for
certain machine learning tools, primarily pattern recognition techniques using advanced mathematical algorithms to analyze large
amounts of data thereby uncovering patterns that might otherwise be undetectable.  Such machine learning tools are currently
in use for diagnostics and drug discovery, but are also marketed for other applications.  The Company licenses the use
of its patent protected technology and may provide services to develop specific learning tools under development agreements or
to sell to third parties. 

The accounting principles
followed by the Company and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (GAAP). In preparing financial statements in conformity with GAAP, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Actual results could differ significantly from those
estimates. 

The interim financial
statements included in this report are unaudited but reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary
for a fair presentation of the financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments
are of a normal recurring nature. The results of operations for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results of a full year s operations and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and
footnotes included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Note B   REVENUE RECOGNITION   

Revenue is generated
through the sale or license of patented technology and processes and from services provided through development agreements.  These
arrangements are generally governed by contracts that dictate responsibilities and payment terms.  The Company recognizes
revenues as they are earned over the duration of a license agreement or upon the sale of any owned patent once all contractual
obligations have been fulfilled.  If a license agreement has an undetermined or unlimited life, the revenue is recognized
over the remaining expected life of the patents. Revenue is recognized under development agreements in the period the services
are performed. 

The Company treats
the incremental direct cost of revenue arrangements, which consists principally of employee bonuses, as deferred charges and these
incremental direct costs are amortized to expense using the straight-line method over the same term as the related deferred revenue
recognition. 

Deferred revenue represents
the unearned portion of payments received in advance for licensing and development agreements. The Company had total unearned revenue
of $115,700 as of September 30, 2016. Unearned revenue of $43,388 is recorded as current and $72,312 is classified as long-term. 

Note C - NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE   

Basic Earnings Per
Share ( EPS ) includes no dilution and is computed by dividing income or loss available to common stockholders by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of securities
that could share in the earnings or losses of the entity. Due to the net loss in all periods presented, potentially dilutive shares
are not included in the calculation of diluted EPS, as those shares would create an anti-dilutive result. 

Note D - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION
 and other EQUITY BASED PAYMENTS    

Stock-based compensation
expense included in our net loss for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $35,163 and $175,931,
respectively, for stock options granted to employees, directors, and consultants. Stock-based compensation expense included in
our net loss for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $17,071 and $51,212, respectively. 

As of September 30,
2016, there was $192,993 of unrecognized cost related to stock option grants.  The cost is to be recognized over the
remaining vesting periods that average approximately 2.25 years.

In connection with
their election to the Board of Directors, on May 17, 2016, the Company granted to Mr. Henry Kaplan, Mr. Kevin Kowbel, Mr. George
McGovern, and Mr. William Quirk each an option to purchase 1,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock. The options for
Messrs. Kaplan, Kowbel, McGovern and Quirk vest 250,000 shares every six months, have an exercise price of $0.035, and expire on
May 17, 2026. The fair value of each option granted is $0.0265 and was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing
model with the following assumptions: dividend yield at 0%, risk-free interest rate of 1.89%, an expected life of 5 years, and
volatility of 102%. The aggregate computed fair value of these options is $158,756, and this amount will be charged as an expense
over the three-year vesting period. 

Additionally, in recognition
of his leadership as Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO, on May 17, 2016, the Company granted to Mr. Kevin Kowbel an option
to purchase 3,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock. The options for Mr. Kowbel vest immediately, have an exercise
price of $0.035, and expire on May 17, 2026. The fair value of each option granted is $0.0265 and was estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield at 0%, risk-free interest rate of 1.89%,
an expected life of 5 years, and volatility of 102%. The aggregate computed fair value of these options is $79,519, and this amount
was charged as an expense during the second quarter of 2016. 

On February 8, 2016,
the Company granted options to purchase 5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock to a group of employees and consultants
in recognition of their efforts to lower the Company s monthly expenditures and compensation and their continuing contributions
to the Company. The options vest over a two-year period, have an exercise price of $.03, and expire on February 8, 2026. Within
the group of 5,000,000 options, the Company s Vice President, Mark A. Moore, Ph.D., received an option to purchase 500,000
shares of the Company s common stock and the Company s Senior Vice President, Hong Zhang, Ph.D., received an option
to purchase 1,250,000 shares of the Company s common stock. The fair value of each option granted is $0.0219 and was estimated
on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield at 0%, risk-free interest
rate of 1.99%, an expected life of 5 years, and volatility of 96%. The aggregate computed fair value of these options is
$109,271, and this amount will be charged as an expense over the two-year vesting period. Because at the time of issuance, these
options exceeded the amount of common shares available if the holders exercised the previously issued outstanding options
and warrants, the Company needed to increase the authorized shares of common stock in order to satisfy these options. The shareholders
of the Company approved this increase in authorized shares on May 17, 2016. 

In the fourth quarter
of 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of Series C Preferred Shares in private placement transactions. As of
December 31, 2015, the Company had issued a total of 30,000,000 preferred shares. The Series C Preferred Shares were fully subscribed
in the third quarter 2015. The Series C Preferred Shares are accompanied by $0.03 warrants and $0.03 contingency warrants. The
contingency warrants were issued during the three months ended March 31, 2016 as a result of the Company not attaining profitability
by the end of the first quarter 2016. Because at the time of issuance, these warrants exceeded the amount of common shares
available if the holders exercised the previously issued outstanding options and warrants, the Company needed to increase the
authorized shares of common stock in order to satisfy these options. The shareholders of the Company approved this increase in
authorized shares on May 17, 2016. The fair value of each warrant granted was $0.0219 and was estimated on the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield at 0%, risk-free interest rate of 1.67%,
an expected life of 5 years, and volatility of 96%. 

During the third quarter
of 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of Common Stock in a private placement of 7,000,000 Common Shares with
certain warrant features. As of March 31, 2016, 7,000,000 shares of this offering were sold. During the three and six month periods
ended March 31, 2016, the Company sold 3,000,000 of these shares and received $90,000 in proceeds. The Common Shares are accompanied
by $0.03 warrants and $0.06 contingency warrants. The contingency warrants were issued during the three months ended March 31,
2016 as a result of the Company not attaining profitability by the end of the first quarter 2016. Because at the time of issuance,
these warrants exceeded the amount of common shares available if the holders exercised the previously issued outstanding options
and warrants, the Company needed to increase the authorized shares of common stock in order to satisfy these options. The shareholders
of the Company approved this increase in authorized shares on May 17, 2016. The fair value of each warrant granted was
$0.0219 and was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend
yield at 0%, risk-free interest rate of 1.67%, an expected life of 5 years, and volatility of 96%.

Note D - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  and

Furthermore, as a result
of the Company issuing options and warrants which exceeded the amount of common shares available if the holders exercised the previously
issued outstanding options and warrants, the Company recorded an increase in the common stock warrants liability during the first
quarter of 2016 of $940,812 and $255,800 during the second quarter of 2016. 

As previously disclosed
above, the Company had issued options and warrants which exceeded the amount of common shares available if the holders exercised
all of the previously issued outstanding options and warrants. This created a common stock warrant liability for the Company.
During the first quarter, based upon the trading price of the Company s common stock, this liability increased by
$940,812 and during the second quarter of 2016 increased by $1,196,612. At the Annual Shareholder Meeting of the Company
held on May 17, 2016, the shareholders approved an increase to the authorized shares of common and preferred stock. As a result,
the Company has enough common stock available if the holders exercised all of the previously issued outstanding options and warrants.
This resulted in there no longer being a common stock warrant liability for the Company. With the reduction in the common
stock warrant liability, the Company increased the common stock value within the balance sheet. 

As of September 30,
2016, there were 100,750,000 option and warrant shares outstanding with a weighted average exercise price of $0.033. The following
schedule summarizes combined stock option and warrant information as of September 30, 2016: 

The weighted average
remaining life of all outstanding warrants and options at September 30, 2016 are 9.35 years. The aggregate intrinsic value
of all options and warrants outstanding and exercisable as of September 30, 2016 was $392,400, based on the market closing
price of $0.0351 on September 30, 2016, less exercise prices. 

Note E - PATENTS   

The Company has acquired
and developed a group of patents related to biotechnology and certain machine learning tools used for diagnostic and drug discovery.
Legal costs associated with patent acquisitions and the application processes for new patents are also capitalized as patent assets.
The Company has recorded as other assets $744,026 in patents and patent related costs, net of $ 3,241,769 in accumulated
amortization, at September 30, 2016. 

Amortization charged
to operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $65,680 and $197,039 in both years. Estimated
amortization expense for the next three years, including 2016, is $262,720 per year. Estimated amortization expense for
the fourth year is $152,906 and no amortization expense for the fifth year.

Note F   STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY   

Series C Preferred Stock   

In the fourth quarter
of 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of Series C Preferred Shares in private placement transactions. As of December
31, 2015, the Company had issued a total of 30,000,000 preferred shares. The Series C Preferred Shares were fully subscribed in
the third quarter of 2015. The Series C Preferred Shares are accompanied by $0.03 warrants and $0.03 contingency warrants. The
contingency warrants were issued during the three month period ended March 31, 2016 as a result of the Company not attaining profitability
by the end of the first quarter 2016. The holders must exercise fifty percent of the warrants if the market price for the Company s
common stock is $0.20 for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or the warrants will expire.  The holders must
also exercise fifty percent of the warrants if the market price for the Company s common stock is $0.30 for a period
of thirty consecutive calendar days or the warrants will expire.  The fair value of each warrant granted is $0.0219 and
was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield at 0%,
risk-free interest rate of 1.67%, an expected life of 5 years, and volatility of 96%. The aggregate fair value of these warrants
is $656,380. 

The Series C Preferred
Stock has not been registered under either federal or state securities laws and must be held until a registration statement covering
such securities is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission or an applicable exemption applies. 

Each share of Series
C Preferred Stock may be converted into one share of Common Stock of the Company at the option of the holder, without the payment
of additional consideration by the holder, so long as the Company has a sufficient number of authorized shares to allow for the
exercise of all of its outstanding warrants and options. The Shares of Series C Preferred Stock must be converted into Common Stock
of the Company either by the demand by the shareholder or at the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. If the Company were
to be dissolved, the Series C Preferred Stock receives preferential treatment over Common Stock. 

During the third quarter
of 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of Common Stock in a private placement of 7,000,000 Common Shares with
certain warrant features. As of September 30, 2016, 7,000,000 shares of this offering have been sold. The Common Shares are accompanied
by $0.03 warrants and $0.06 contingency warrants. The contingency warrants were issued during the three month period ended March
31, 2016 as a result of the Company not attaining profitability by the end of the first quarter 2016. The holders must exercise
fifty percent of the warrants if the market price for the Company s common stock is $0.20 for a period of thirty consecutive
calendar days or the warrants will expire.  The holders must also exercise fifty percent of the warrants if
the market price for the Company s common stock is $0.30 for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or the warrants
will expire.  The fair value of each warrant granted is $0.0219 and was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield at 0%, risk-free interest rate of 1.67%, an expected life of 5 years,
and volatility of 96%. 

Note G   INVESTMENT IN AVAILABLE FOR SALE SECURITIES   

The Company has elected
the fair value option in accordance with ASC 825,  Financial Instruments,  as it relates to its shares held in NeoGenomics 
common stock that were acquired resulting from the NeoGenomics Master License Agreement executed on January 6, 2012. Management
made the election for the fair value option related to this investment because it believes the fair value option for the NeoGenomics
common stock provides a better measurement from which to compare financial statements from reporting period to reporting period.
No other financial assets or liabilities are fair valued using the fair value option. 

The Company s
investment in NeoGenomics  common stock is recorded on the accompanying balance sheets under the caption Investment in Available
for Sale Securities. The carrying value of this investment on the date of acquisition approximated $1,945,000. The change in fair
value from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 is an unrealized gain of $6,096 for the remaining 18,000 shares held
and is classified as other expense under the caption Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Available for Sale Securities in the accompanying
statements of operations. There are three levels of investments in the fair value hierarchy that assesses a company's assets based
on the degree of certainty around the asset's underlying value. A Level 1 asset can be valued with certainty because they are
liquid and have clear market prices. At the other end of the spectrum, Level 3 assets are illiquid and estimating their value
requires inputs that are unobservable and reflect significant management assumptions. The Company classifies its investment as
an available for sale security presented as a trading security on the balance sheets and the fair value is considered a Level
1 investment in the fair value hierarchy. The September 30, 2016 fair value of the investment of $148,074 is for the remaining
shares held and is calculated using the closing stock price of the NeoGenomics common stock at the end of the reporting period.

Note H   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

On July 17, 2013,
the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand (the  Demand ) from the Federal Trade Commission of the United States
of America (the  FTC ) relating to the Company's MelApp software application. In the Demand, the FTC requested information
relating to potentially unfair or deceptive acts or practices related to (i) false advertising and (ii) consumer privacy and data
security, in violation of Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. Sections 45 and 42. 

On February 23,
2015, the FTC notified the Company of its approval, by a vote of 4-1, to accept an Agreement Containing Consent Order ( Agreement ).
This Agreement was for settlement purposes only. The Company neither admitted nor denied any of the allegations, except as specifically
stated in the Agreement. The Company believed the effort to contest this matter with the FTC would require funds greater than
the Company had at its disposal. 

The Agreement does,
among other things, bar the Company from claiming that any device detects or diagnoses melanoma or its risk factors, or increases
users  chances of early detection, unless the representation is not misleading and supported by competent and reliable scientific
evidence in the form of human clinical testing of the device. The Agreement also prohibits the Company from making any other misleading
or unsubstantiated claims about a device s health benefits or efficacy, unless the representation is not misleading and
supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence in the form of human clinical testing of the device. Finally, the Company
was required to pay $17,693 to the FTC, which was accrued during the three month period ended March 31, 2015. This amount is included
as Settlement Expense in the accompanying statements of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. 

The Company s
balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflected an accrued liability of approximately $239,910 for professional services. 
In an effort to conserve cash, the Company worked with several of the vendors regarding a portion of this amount by negotiating
with the service providers regarding potential reduction of the amount billed. During the quarter ended September 30,
2015, the Company and the service providers negotiated the amounts owed and as a result, the Company recorded a decrease in accounts
payables of $121,503. During the period ended September 30, 2016 there was no forgiveness on payables. 

The Company is subject to various claims
primarily arising in the normal course of business.  Although the outcome of these matters cannot be determined, the
Company does not believe it is probable that any such claims will result in material costs and expenses. 

Note I   FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND GOING CONCERN   

The Company has prepared
its financial statements on a  going concern  basis, which presumes that it will be able to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. 

The Company s
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our licensing arrangements with third parties, achieving profitable operations,
obtaining additional financing and successfully bringing the Company s technologies to the market.  The outcome of these
matters cannot be predicted at this time.  The Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis and do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classifications of the assets and liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue in business. 

If the going concern
assumption was not appropriate for the Company s financial statements then adjustments would be necessary in the carrying
value of assets and liabilities, the reported expenses and the balance sheet classifications used.  Such adjustments may be
material.  

At September 30,
2016, the Company had $183,451 of cash on hand along with its investment in NeoGenomics stock classified as available for
sale securities worth $148,074. Also, at September 30, 2016, the Company had $390,191 in current liabilities. As a result,
the Company estimates cash will be depleted by the end of  first quarter 2017 if the Company does not generate sufficient
cash to support operations. 

The Company s
plan to have sufficient cash to support operations is comprised of generating revenue through finding new opportunities to license
its technology, providing services related to those patents, selling its NeoGenomics stock, and obtaining additional equity or
debt financing. 

During the third quarter
of 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of Common Stock in a private placement of 7,000,000 Common Shares with
certain warrant features. As of September 30, 2016, 7,000,000 shares of this offering had been sold. During the first quarter of
2016, the Company sold 3,000,000 of these shares and received $90,000 in proceeds. 

The Company is
currently in discussions with NeoGenomics to modify the current agreement between the two companies. One of the goals for these
discussions is to obtain quarterly payments from NeoGenomics that would help cover monthly expenses. 

Additionally, the
Company is attempting to encourage the Series C Preferred Stockholders to exercise some or all of their warrants in order to help
fund the operations of the Company. 

While the Company believes these efforts will create a profitable
future, there is no guarantee the Company will be successful in these efforts.

Note J   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    

In February 2016, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards ( ASU ) 2016-02, Leases.  This
standard update was issued to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease
liabilities, including for operating leases, on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02
is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact that adopting ASU 2016-02 will have on its financial statements. 

In November 2015, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  This standard update provides guidance
for balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. This standard requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified
as non-current on the balance sheet, and eliminates the prior guidance which required an entity to separate deferred tax liabilities
and assets into a current amount and a noncurrent amount on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim
periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an
interim or annual period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact that adopting ASU 2015-17 will have on its
financial statements. 

Note K  ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Patents   

 Initial costs paid
to purchase patents are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the remaining life of the patent. The Company
capitalizes the external costs and filing fees associated with obtaining patents on its new discoveries and amortizes these costs
using the straight-line method over the shorter of the legal life of the patent or its economic life, generally 17 years, beginning
on the date the patent is issued.  Annual patent maintenance costs and annual license and renewal registration fees are expensed
as period costs. If the applied for patents are abandoned or are not issued, the Company will expense the costs capitalized to
date in the period of abandonment or earlier if abandonment appears probable.  The carrying value of patents is reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. As of September
30, 2016, the Company does not believe there has been any impairment of its patents. 

Stock-based Compensation   

Stock-based compensation
cost is measured at grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. 

Valuation and Amortization
Method    The fair value awards of stock that do not contain a market condition target are estimated on the grant date
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of options that contain a market condition, such as a specified hurdle
price, is estimated on the grant date using a probability weighted fair value model similar to a lattice valuation model. 
Both the Black-Scholes and the probability weighted valuation models require assumptions and estimates of expected volatility,
expected life, expected dividend yield and expected risk-free interest rates. 

Expected Term 
  The expected term of the award represents the period that the Company s stock-based awards are expected to be outstanding
and was determined based on historical experience, giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock-based awards, vesting
schedules, and forfeitures due to departure prior to the end of the vesting schedule.   

Expected Volatility
   Volatility is a measure of the amounts by which a financial variable such as stock price has fluctuated (historical
volatility) or is expected to fluctuate (expected volatility) during a period. The Company uses the historical volatility, employing
a prior period equivalent to the expected term to estimate expected volatility. 

Risk-Free Interest
Rate    The Company bases the risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes valuation method on the implied yield
currently available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to the expected term of a stock award. 

HEALTH DISCOVERY CORPORATION  

Item
2.      Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Corporate Overview  

Our Company is a pattern
recognition company that uses advanced mathematical techniques to analyze large amounts of data to uncover patterns that might
otherwise be undetectable. The Company operates primarily in the field of molecular diagnostics where such tools are critical to
scientific discovery. The terms artificial intelligence and machine learning are sometimes used to describe pattern recognition
tools. 

HDC s mission
is to use its patents, intellectual prowess, and clinical partnerships principally to identify patterns that can advance the science
of medicine, as well as to advance the effective use of our technology in other diverse business disciplines, including the high-tech,
financial, and healthcare technology markets. 

Our historical foundation
lies in the molecular diagnostics field where we have made a number of discoveries that play a role in developing more personalized
approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of certain diseases. However, our Support Vector Machine ( SVM ) assets in
particular have broad applicability in many other fields. Intelligently applied, HDC s pattern recognition technology can
be a portal between enormous amounts of otherwise undecipherable data and truly meaningful discovery. 

Our Company s
principal asset is its intellectual property which includes advanced mathematical algorithms called SVM and Fractal Genomic Modeling
(FGM), as well as biomarkers that we discovered by applying our SVM and FGM techniques to complex genetic and proteomic data. Biomarkers
are biological indicators or genetic expression signatures of certain disease states. Our intellectual property is protected by
over 60 patents that have been issued or are currently pending around the world. 

Our business model
has evolved over time to respond to business trends that intersect with our technological expertise and our capacity to professionally
manage these opportunities. In the beginning, we sought only to use our SVMs internally in order to discover and license our biomarker
signatures to various diagnostic and pharmaceutical companies. Today, our commercialization efforts include: utilization of our
discoveries and knowledge to help develop diagnostic and prognostic predictive tests; licensing of the SVM and FGM technologies
directly to diagnostic companies; and the potential formation of new ventures with domain experts in other fields where our pattern
recognition technology holds commercial promise. 

Operational Activities  

The Company markets
its technology and related developmental expertise to prospects in the healthcare, biotech, and life sciences industries.  Given
the scope of some of these prospects, the sales cycle can be quite long, but management believes that these marketing efforts may
produce favorable results in the future.   

NeoGenomics License   

On January 6, 2012,
we entered into a Master License Agreement (the  NeoGenomics License ) with NeoGenomics Laboratories, Inc. ( NeoGenomics
Laboratories ), a wholly owned subsidiary of NeoGenomics, Inc. ( NeoGenomics ). Pursuant to the terms of the
NeoGenomics License, we granted to NeoGenomics Laboratories and its affiliates an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our
patents and know-how to use, develop and sell products in the fields of laboratory testing, molecular diagnostics, clinical pathology,
anatomic pathology and digital image analysis (excluding non-pathology-related radiologic and photographic image analysis) relating
to the development, marketing production or sale of any  Laboratory Developed Tests  or LDTs or other products used
for diagnosing, ruling out, predicting a response to treatment, and/or monitoring treatment of any or all hematopoietic and solid
tumor cancers excluding cancers affecting the retina and breast cancer. We retain all rights to in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) test
kit development. 

Upon execution of the
NeoGenomics License, NeoGenomics paid us $1,000,000 in cash and issued to us 1,360,000 shares of NeoGenomic s common stock,
par value $0.001 per share, which had a market value of $1,945,000 using the closing price of $1.43 per share for NeoGenomic s
common stock on January 6, 2012. In addition, the NeoGenomics License provides for milestone payments in cash or stock, based on
sublicensing revenue and revenue generated from products and services developed as a result of the NeoGenomics License. Milestone
payments will be in increments of $500,000 for every $2,000,000 in GAAP revenue recognized by NeoGenomics up to a total of $5,000,000
in potential milestone payments. After $20,000,000 in cumulative GAAP revenue has been recognized by NeoGenomics, we will receive
a royalty of (i) 6.5% (subject to adjustment under certain circumstances) on net revenue generated from all Licensed Uses except
for the Cytogenetic Interpretation System and the
Flow Cytometry Interpretation System and (ii) a royalty of 50% of net revenue (after the recoupment of certain development and
commercialization costs) that NeoGenomics derives from any sublicensing arrangements it may put in place for the Cytogenetic Interpretation
System and the Flow Cytometry Interpretation System. 

HEALTH DISCOVERY CORPORATION  

Management s Discussion and Analysis,
continued  

NeoGenomics agreed
to use its best efforts to commercialize certain products within one year of the date of the license, subject to two one-year extensions
per product if needed, including a  Plasma Prostate Cancer Test , a  Pancreatic Cancer Test , a  Colon
Cancer Test , a  Cytogenetic Interpretation System , and a  Flow Cytometry Interpretation System. 
NeoGenomics has completed both of its one-year extension terms of the license. 

If NeoGenomics has
not generated $5.0 million of net revenue from products, services and sublicensing arrangements by January 2017, we may, at our
option, revoke the exclusivity with respect to any one or more of the initial licensed products, subject to certain conditions.
The Company does not expect NeoGenomics to generate $5.0 million of net revenue related from products, services and sublicensing
arrangements by January 2017. 

The Company is evaluating
its rights under the license agreement and the best possibility to commercialize the Company s technologies. 

Plasma Test for Prostate Cancer  

NeoGenomics is developing
a Blood Test for Prostate Cancer under the direction of Dr. Maher Albitar using the genes patented by HDC. The test is performed
on blood plasma and urine rather than only prostate tissue biopsies. NeoGenomics completed Phase I of their research and published
the results in 2014. Additionally, NeoGenomics completed Phase II of their prostate test validation in 2014. The results were largely
the same as those published regarding Phase I. NeoGenomics continues working on this test, named NeoLAB  Prostate  
Liquid Alternative to Biopsy. Per the license agreement, any commercial use of the NeoLAB  Prostate Test by NeoGenomics will
require compensation to HDC. 

Cytogenetic Analysis   

Cytogenetic analysis
is the science of studying chromosomes. Microscopic evaluation of individual chromosomes remains the first step in the evaluation
of the human genome. Cytogenetic analysis is performed on almost all patients with hematopoietic diseases (blood cancers such as
leukemia and lymphoma) and on a significant number of patients with solid tumors. The collected data is useful for diagnosis, prognosis
and monitoring of diseases. Currently, specially trained technicians perform most of the analysis manually. The work is labor-intensive
and subjective. Computer automation of this work could significantly reduce cost and improve the quality of the test. The Company
has spent a considerable amount of time using SVM Technology to create significant improvement in cytogenetic analysis. 

Flow Cytometry  

Management believes
that our efforts to develop an SVM-based diagnostic test to help interpret flow cell cytometry data for myelodysplastic syndrome
(pre-leukemia) has resulted in a successful proof of concept. The Company is now capable of completing development, final validation
and commercialization of the new diagnostic test for the interpretation of flow cytometry data. 

SVM Capital, LLC   

In January 2007, SVM
Capital, LLC ( SVM Capital ) was formed as a joint venture between HDC and Atlantic Alpha Strategies, LLC ( Atlantic
Alpha ) to explore and exploit the potential applicability of our SVM technology to quantitative investment management techniques.  Atlantic
Alpha s management has over thirty years of experience in commodity and futures trading. 

HEALTH DISCOVERY CORPORATION  

Management s Discussion and Analysis,
continued  

On June 16, 2015, SVM
Capital joined Manifold Partners, LLC ( Manifold Partners ) as a partner.  Manifold Partners
is a San Francisco-based multi-strategy portfolio management firm specializing in quantitative investment methodologies. As a part
of the partnership, SVM Capital will contribute their proprietary service to the collaboration with Manifold Partners. This new
collaboration will be known as Manifold Vector. SVM Capital specializes in the application of an artificial intelligence technique
to investment strategies. SVM Capital has developed mathematical algorithms to rank-order S P 500 stocks to determine investment
desirability, including long and short equity positions. Importantly, only fundamental corporate data is analyzed, which Manifold
Partners believes to be unique in the quantitative investment field. This technology is an outgrowth of the machine learning techniques
created by the Company.   

Intellectual Property Developments   

In January 2016, the
U.S. Patent Office issued a notice of allowance of the Company s application covering analysis of chromosomal abnormalities
using support vector machines. The automated analysis method greatly reduces the time required for visual inspection of images
of chromosomes while providing more accurate and repeatable results. The Company has a companion application covering this technology
still pending in Europe. 

The Company now holds
the exclusive rights to 53 issued U.S. and foreign patents covering uses of SVM and FGM technology for discovery of knowledge from
large data sets. The Company also has 8 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications covering uses of the SVM technology as well
as diagnostic methods that have been discovered using the SVM technology. A reduction in the total number of issued and pending
patents during 2015 resulted from the Company s decision to allow certain foreign patents issued and/or filed in countries
that were deemed to have lower strategic value to lapse. In addition, a few U.S. patents that were either near the ends of their
terms and/or had parallel applications with broader claims in force were allowed to expire. In addition, significant changes in
the U.S. Patent Laws relating to the eligibility of certain subject matter for patent protection influenced the Company s
decision to abandon a few of its pending U.S. applications. This in turn reduced the Company s total expenses for patent
maintenance. 

Intel Update   

As previously disclosed,
the Company submitted a patent application to provoke an interference with Intel s Patent No. 7,685,077. The application
file had been transferred to the U.S. Patent Office s Interference Division. 

On September 21, 2016,
the Company received notification that the United States Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) declared an Interference
between the Company s pending patent application covering SVM-Recursive Feature Elimination ( SVM-RFE ) and Intel s
Patent No. 7,685,077, entitled  Recursive Feature Eliminating Method based on a Support Vector Machine .  
An Interference is an administrative proceeding within the USPTO that is used to determine which party was the first to invent
an invention that is claimed in two (or more) independently-owned patent applications.   The Company has been designated
the  Senior Party  in the Interference, meaning that it is entitled to a presumption of prior inventorship based on
its earlier filing date.  As the  Junior Party , the burden falls upon Intel to prove that it conceived and reduced
the claimed invention to practice prior to the Company s earlier filing date.   

In addition to the
patent application involved in the Interference, the Company currently has three issued U.S. patents and five issued foreign patents
covering the SVM-RFE method.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016
Compared with Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue  

For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, revenue was $10,847 compared with $12,050 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The revenue
earned during the third quarter in 2016 and 2015 is related to the revenue recognition of the Vermillion settlement. 

Operating and Other Expenses  

Amortization expense
was $65,680 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $65,875 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Amortization
expense relates primarily to the costs associated with filing patent applications and acquiring rights to the patents. 

Professional and consulting
fees totaled $51,848 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $30,965 for the same 2015 period. These fees
consist primarily of patent filing and maintenance costs, professional fees, and accounting fees. The increase was due to higher
patent filing fees. 

Legal fees decreased
over the three-month period with fees totaling $6,225 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $9,000 during the same
period in 2015. 

Research and development
expense was $9,000 for both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This expense for research and development relates
primarily to work completed under the NeoGenomics License. 

Compensation expense
of $56,179 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was higher than the $48,328 reported for the comparable 2015 period.
The increase is attributed to the cost associated with option grants to employees. 

Other general and administrative
expense increased to $42,514 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $33,438 for the same period in 2015. This
increase was related to expenses associated with directors  options.  

Other Income and Expense  

The Company received
a portion of the NeoGenomics license fee in NeoGenomics stock. The Company has chosen to measure the gain or loss on the value
of this asset using the fair value option method. During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the NeoGenomics
stock fair value increased by $3,240, which is recorded as other income in the statements of operations. During the same three
month period in 2015, the NeoGenomics stock fair value increased by $9,275. 

As previously discussed
in Note H to the financial statements, the Company negotiated a reduction of amounts owed with certain service providers. As a
result, the Company realized an increase in other income and expense (forgiveness on payables) of $121,503 during the three month
period ended September 30, 2015. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016
Compared with Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue  

For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, revenue was $32,665 compared with $33,754 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The revenue earned
is almost entirely related to the licensing revenue recognition for the Vermillion settlement. 

Operating and Other Expenses  

Amortization expense
was $197,234 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $197,770 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Amortization
expense relates primarily to the costs associated with filing patent applications and acquiring rights to the patents. 

HEALTH DISCOVERY CORPORATION  

Management s Discussion and Analysis,
continued  

Professional and consulting
fees were $173,274 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $129,377 for the same 2015 period. The increase was
due to higher patent filing fees. 

Legal fees totaled
$21,225 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $37,357 during the same period in 2015. The reduction was
due to settling the FTC Matter in 2015 that did not reoccur in 2016. 

Research and development
fees were $27,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $31,813 for the same period in 2015. This expense for research
and development relates primarily to work completed under the NeoGenomics License. 

Compensation expense
of $233,035 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was more than the $142,665 reported for the comparable 2015 period. The
increase is attributed to the cost associate with option grants to employees during the second quarter of 2016. 

Other general and
administrative expenses decreased to $147,811 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $116,112 in 2015. This
increase was related to expenses associated with directors  options granted in the second quarter of 2016.  

Other Income and Expense  

The Company received
a portion of the NeoGenomics license fee in NeoGenomics stock. The Company has chosen to measure the gain or loss on the value
of this asset using the fair value option method. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the NeoGenomics stock
fair value increased by $6,096, which is recorded as other income in the statements of operations. During the same period in 2015,
the NeoGenomics stock increased by $72,231. 

Because the Company
had issued warrants exceeding the amount of common shares available if holders exercised all of the previously issued outstanding
options and warrants, the Company recorded an increase in the common stock warrants liability of $1,196,612 during the first
and second quarters of 2016. 

As previously discussed
in Note H to the financial statements, the Company negotiated a reduction of amounts owed with certain service providers. As a
result, the Company realized an increase in other income and expense (forgiveness of payables) of $121,503. 

As a result of the
settlement with the FTC over actions by previous management, the Company recognized a settlement expense of $17,693 during the
first quarter 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We have prepared our
financial statements on a  going concern  basis, which presumes that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge
our liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. 

Our ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon our licensing arrangements with third parties, achieving profitable operations, obtaining
additional financing and successfully bringing our technologies to the market.  The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted
at this time.  Our financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to
the amounts and classifications of the assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in business. 

The Company is
currently in discussions with NeoGenomics to modify the current agreement between the two companies. One of the goals for these
discussions is to obtain quarterly payments from NeoGenomics that would help cover monthly expenses. 

Additionally, the
Company is attempting to encourage the Series C Preferred Stockholders to exercise some or all of their warrants in order to help
fund the operations of the Company. 

At September 30,
2016, the Company had $183,451 in cash and total current liabilities of $390,191. The primary amount of current liabilities
relates to $206,637 in dividends payable and $140,166 in accounts payable. Additionally, we continue to sell our NeoGenomics
Stock in order to fund operations. Although the NeoGenomics stock has increased in value since the initial acquisition date,
the number of shares and amount of cash we can generate from the sale of NeoGenomics Stock is subject to fluctuating market
and price conditions. As a result, we will not have sufficient resources to meet all of our current obligations unless the
Company is able to secure funds via licensing activity or other forms of fund raising either in the debt or equity markets.
During the third quarter of 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of Common Stock in a private placement of
7,000,000 Common Shares with certain warrant features. During the three month period ended March 31, 2016, the Company sold
3,000,000 of these shares and received $90,000 in proceeds. None of these options are definitive and there is no guarantee
the Company will be successful in these fund raising efforts. The Company estimates cash will be depleted by the end of
first quarter 2017 unless the Company is able to raise additional capital or amend the agreement with NeoGenomics. 

HEALTH DISCOVERY CORPORATION  

Management s Discussion and Analysis,
continued  

At September 30, 2016, the Company had no
contractual obligations that require disclosure. 

The Company has relied
primarily on equity and debt financing for liquidity. The Company produced sales, licensing, and developmental revenue starting
in late 2005 and must increase revenues in order to generate sufficient cash to continue operations. The Company s plan to
have sufficient cash to support operations is comprised of selling its NeoGenomics Stock, generating revenue through licensing
its patent portfolio, providing services related to those patents, and obtaining additional equity or debt financing. Since January
2015, the Company has been unable to generate significant revenue, as further described above. As a result, the Company has implemented
a cash conservation program. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has no
off-balance sheet arrangements that provide financing, liquidity, market or credit risk support or involve leasing, hedging or
research and development services for our business or other similar arrangements that may expose us to liability that is not expressly
reflected in the financial statements.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

As of the end of the
period covered by this report (the  Evaluation Date ), we carried out an evaluation regarding the fiscal quarter ended
September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer,
who is also serving as our Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls
and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  Based
upon this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, because of the Company s internal control
weakness, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to
be disclosed in the reports that are filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported
within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that our disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management including our Chief Executive Officer, as appropriate, to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

HEALTH DISCOVERY CORPORATION  

Our Annual Report on
Form 10-K contains information regarding a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2015 due to an inadequate segregation of duties resulting from our small number of employees. 

Because of the inherent
limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures will detect or uncover every situation involving the failure of persons within the Company to disclose
material information otherwise required to be set forth in the Company s periodic reports.  

The Company s
management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  As of the Evaluation Date, no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting occurred that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings  

None. 

Item 1A.   Risk Factors  

In addition to the
other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the risk factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A.
Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business,
financial condition or future results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our
Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity
Securities and Use of Proceeds  

In the fourth quarter
of 2013, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of Series C Preferred Shares in private placement transactions. As of
December 31, 2015, the Company had issued a total of 30,000,000 preferred shares. The Series C Preferred Shares were fully subscribed
in the third quarter 2015. The Company received total net proceeds of $900,000, of which $568,000 was received in the period ended
September 30, 2015. The Series C Preferred Shares were accompanied by $0.03 warrants and $0.03 contingency warrants. The
contingency warrants were issued during the three month period ended March 31, 2016 as a result of the Company not attaining profitability
by the end of the first quarter 2016. The holders must exercise fifty percent of the warrants if the market price for the Company s
common stock is $0.20 for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or the warrants will expire.  The holders must
also exercise fifty percent of the warrants if the market price for the Company s common stock is $0.30 for a
period of thirty consecutive calendar days or the warrants will expire.  The warrants were valued at $0.0219 each using
the Black Scholes Method. 

The Series C Preferred
Stock has not been registered under either federal or state securities laws and must be held until a registration statement covering
such securities is declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission or an applicable exemption applies. 

The Series C Preferred
Stock may be converted into Common Stock of the Company at the option of the holder, without the payment of additional consideration
by the holder, so long as the Company has a sufficient number of authorized shares to allow for the exercise of all of its outstanding
warrants and options. The Shares of Series C Preferred Stock must be converted into Common Stock of the Company either by the demand
by the shareholder or at the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. If the Company were to be dissolved, the Series C Preferred
Stock receives preferential treatment over Common Stock. 

HEALTH DISCOVERY CORPORATION  

During the third quarter
of 2015, the Board of Directors authorized the issuance of Common Stock in a private placement of 7,000,000 Common Shares with
certain warrant features. As of March 31, 2016, 7,000,000 shares of this offering were sold. During the three month period ended
March 31, 2016, the Company sold 3,000,000 of these shares and received $90,000 in proceeds. The Common Shares are accompanied
by $0.03 warrants and $0.06 contingency warrants. The contingency warrants were issued during the three months ended March 31,
2016 as a result of the Company not attaining profitability by the end of the first quarter 2016.
