Note 5   GOING CONCERN

The Company generated minimal revenues prior to the current fiscal year.  No revenues were generated for the six month period ended September 30, 2016. This level of revenues is not sufficient for the Company to meet its future obligations. This factor raises substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.

The Company is in the midst of the Dutro litigation and other litigation.  The litigation has hindered the operation of the Company and have set back the ability to raise capital and develop ongoing business in order to continue forward as a going concern. It is expected that litigation will continue to hinder the ability to continue as a going concern through the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and beyond.

Note 6 - INCOME TAX

Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method.  Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets  are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

The Company's financial statements for the six month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 do not include any provision for income taxes.   No income tax accrual has been recorded based on the expectation that the Company will be in a net loss position for the overall applicable fiscal year. Accordingly, deferred tax assets have been entirely offset by valuation allowances. The difference between the amounts of income tax benefit that would result from applying domestic federal statutory income tax rates to the net loss and the net deferred tax assets is related to certain nondeductible expenses, state income taxes, and the change in the valuation allowance.

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") has issued ASC 740 for Accounting for Income Taxes that clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements. ASC 740 requires a company to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position. If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize in the financial statements. As a result of the implementation of ASC 740, the Company performed a review of its material tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by ASC 740.

The Company had no unrecognized tax benefit which would affect the effective tax rate if recognized.

The Company includes interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations in the provision for income taxes.  As of September 30, 2016 the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in the states of Delaware, Utah and any other jurisdiction where required. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2013.

Note 7   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

The Company has evaluated subsequent events per the requirements of ASC Topic 855 and has determined that the following events should be disclosed.

1)

Litigation involving  Dutro Company, Reality Engineering, William Dutro, Vicki Davis, Lee Allen, Valley Inception, LLC, Incisive Software Corporation and Promixex Corporation  continues and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Recently the defendants filed for a dismissal with prejudice.  The dismissal request was denied. The case was moved for continuance in the Utah State Court.  A Court Management Order (CMO) is expected to be filed soon.

2)

The Company is in discussion with multiple legal representatives to take over the management of the litigation on a contingency basis and to pursue litigation with respect to patent infringement by ADT Corp (ADT) and Tyco International Ltd (TYC) and for all other patent infringement against the defendants, their affiliates and related parties currently pursued in the Utah State Court in Salt Lake City.  In anticipation of the new counsel coming in on a contingency basis, the current attorney has withdrawn from the case.  Sector 10 intends to pursue in Federal Courts all other known and unknown licensees of Sector 10's technology that have been distributed by the defendant, their affiliates and other related parties.  Sector 10 believes that it has collected sufficient evidence and related party interests and has sent out nearly 50 subpoenas to parties that are believed to have colluded and/or helped to defraud a publically traded company (Sector 10: SECI) and sell its technology assets to another publically traded company.  In addition, Sector 10 has learned of new facts with respect to the Bank of America (BAC) case and their subsidiary Merrill Lynch which may have prevented the dismissal of the case.  Also new facts have come to light regarding how former contingency attorneys inappropriately allowed two key parties to the case to be dismissed with prejudice immediately before abandoning the case.  These parties, John Gargett (former Board member of Sector 10) and Trusys, Inc. are believed to have been cooperative with the Dutro Group.  These new facts may also enhance the current litigation.   Sector 10 will be seek the assistance  of the Securities   Exchange Commission (SEC) to open an investigation into these matters  Sector 10 has also requested assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to assist in obtaining a stay for the Salt Lake City case while matters are pursued in Federal Courts.

3)

The impact of the issues surrounding the litigation impact the Company's ability to obtain funding needed to operate the Company according to their strategic plans.

4)

Federal and State authorities have and will continue to be updated on the litigation issues and proceedings

Item 2. Management's Discussion And Analysis Or Plan Of Operation

This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 29a of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. You should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, and, when considering such forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors noted in this report, including the section of this report entitled "Risks Related to Our Business and Operations." You should also keep in mind that all forward-looking statements are based on management's existing beliefs about present and future events outside of management's control and on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company's financial statements and notes thereto, which are included elsewhere in this report.

Overview

Sector 10 has developed and seeks to market pre-deployed emergency and disaster response equipment with the world's first patented Stationary Response Units (SRU) and Mobile Response Units (MRU). Sector 10 has patents issued in the United States and patent applications pending with U.S. and international agencies. Sector 10's initial SRU and MRU design has been developed, produced, nationally test marketed and sold.

The Company's cash balance is insufficient to satisfy the Company's cash requirements for the next 12 months. Due to issues surrounding Dutro Group and other pending litigation, the ability to deliver products to customers has been delayed.  Litigation involving various parties continues and is expected to continue for the foreseeable future.  The impact of the issues surrounding the litigation impact the Company's ability to obtain funding needed to operate the Company according to their strategic plans.

Going Concern Qualification

Our notes to the financial statements disclose that the cash flow of the Company has been absorbed in operating activities, has incurred net losses for the fiscal year and has a working capital deficiency. Due to the pending litigation and the current restructuring, the Company operations are not likely to produce positive cash flow until at least the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our going concern uncertainty may affect our ability to raise additional capital, and may also affect our relationships with suppliers and customers. Investors should carefully examine our financial statements and read the notes to the financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Risks Related to the Company's Business and Operations

Investing in the Common Stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks described below, and all of the other information set forth in this report before deciding to invest in shares of the Company's common stock. In addition to historical information, the information in this report contains forward-looking statements about the Company's future business and performance. The Company's actual operating results and financial performance may be different from what the Company's management expects as of the date of this report. The risks described in this report represent the risks that the Company's management has identified and determined to be material to the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company's management, or that the Company's management currently deems to be immaterial, may also materially harm the Company's business operations and financial condition.

Going Concern Qualification

Our notes to the financial statements disclose that the Company has generated no revenue or cash flow, has incurred net losses for the fiscal year and has a working capital deficiency. Due to the pending litigation, the Company operations are not likely to produce positive cash flow until at least the end of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our going concern uncertainty may affect our ability to raise additional capital, and may also affect our relationships with suppliers and customers. Investors should carefully examine our financial statements and read the notes to the financial statements.

13 

Other risk factors to be considered include the following:

The Company has not generated revenues and has not executed any significant contracts for the sale of the Company's products.

The Company uses outside sources to fulfill contract obligations and has limited control over the provider's ability to meet the Company obligations.

The directors, executive officers and principal shareholders of the Company have effective control of the Company, preventing non-affiliate shareholders from significantly influencing the Company's direction and future.

The Company relies on outsourced manufacturers for the production of all Sector 10 products.  Litigation is pending regarding the breach of contract by the former outsourced manufacturer and other issues resulting in indefinite delays in production capability and capacity.

The market for the Company's stock is thin and subject to manipulation.

The market price for the Common Stock is volatile and may change dramatically at any time.

Our business may be affected by increased compensation and benefits costs.

The Company has not paid dividends and does not anticipate paying dividends in the future.

The Common Stock is a "low-priced stock" or "penny stock" and subject to regulation that limits or restricts the potential market for the stock.

Compliance with existing and new regulations of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses.

14 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures

(a)

Based on the evaluation of our "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e)) required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that as of September 30, 2016, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were  effective.

(b)

There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 that occurred during the Company's last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

The Company seeks relief and recovery from the breach of contract and the breakup and transfer by the parties of the technology which ended up with The ADT Corp ("ADT") / Tyco Corp ("TYC") under the label of "Surveillint".

The litigation has been ongoing for multiple years and is expected to continue at least into the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.

The Company is in discussion with multiple legal representatives to take over the management of the litigation on a contingency basis and to pursue litigation with respect to patent infringement by ADT Corp (ADT) and Tyco International Ltd (TYC) and for all other patent infringement against the defendants, their affiliates and related parties currently pursued in the Utah State Court in Salt Lake City.  In anticipation of the new counsel coming in on a contingency basis, the current attorney has withdrawn from the case.  Sector 10 intends to pursue in Federal Courts all other known and unknown licensees of Sector 10's technology that have been distributed by the defendant, their affiliates and other related parties.  Sector 10 believes that it has collected sufficient evidence and related party interests and has sent out nearly 50 subpoenas to parties that are believed to have colluded and/or helped to defraud a publically traded company (Sector 10: SECI) and sell its technology assets to another publically traded company.  In addition, Sector 10 has learned of new facts with respect to the Bank of America (BAC) case and their subsidiary Merrill Lynch which may have prevented the dismissal of the case.  Also new facts have come to light regarding how former contingency attorneys inappropriately allowed two key parties to the case to be dismissed with prejudice immediately before abandoning the case.  These parties, John Gargett (former Board member of Sector 10) and Trusys, Inc. are believed to have been cooperative with the Dutro Group.  These new facts may also enhance the current litigation.   Sector 10 will be seek the assistance  of the Securities   Exchange Commission (SEC) to open an investigation into these matters  Sector 10 has also requested assistance from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to assist in obtaining a stay for the Salt Lake City case while matters are pursued in Federal Courts.
