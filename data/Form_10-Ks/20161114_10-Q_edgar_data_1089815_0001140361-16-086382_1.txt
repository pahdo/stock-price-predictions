NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note A - Basis of Preparation 

The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of U.S. Neurosurgical Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited.  However, in the opinion of management, such statements include all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the information presented therein.  The balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date appearing in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Pursuant to accounting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and notes do not include all disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete financial statements.  Accordingly, these statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's most recent annual financial statements.

Consolidated results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of those to be achieved for full fiscal years.

Note B   Holding Company Structure 

On September 3, 2015, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the  Merger Agreement ), dated as of September 3, 2015, by and among U.S. NeuroSurgical, Inc. ( USN ), U.S. NeuroSurgical Holdings, Inc. ( Holdings ) and U.S. NeuroSurgical Merger Sub, Inc. ( Merger Sub ), the Company adopted a new holding company organizational structure whereby USN is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. This structure did not result in any changes to the assets or operations of the Company, but management believes that it will create a more flexible framework for possible future transactions and organizational and operational adjustments.

The holding company organizational structure was effected by a merger (the  Merger ) conducted pursuant to Section 251(g) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the  DGCL ), which provides for the formation of a holding company structure without a vote of the stockholders of the constituent corporations.  Because the holding company organizational structure occurred at the parent company level, the remainder of the Company s subsidiaries, operations and customers were not affected by this transaction.

In order to effect the Merger, USN formed Holdings as its wholly owned subsidiary and Holdings formed Merger Sub as its wholly owned subsidiary.  Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into USN, with USN surviving the merger and becoming a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings.   Immediately prior to the Merger, Holdings had no assets, liabilities or operations.

Table of Contents 

Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, all of the outstanding capital stock of USN was converted, on a share for share basis, into capital stock of Holdings.  As a result, each former stockholder of USN became the owner of an identical number of shares of capital stock of Holdings, evidencing the same proportional interests in Holdings and having the same designations, rights, powers and preferences, qualifications, limitations and restrictions, as those that the stockholder held in USN.

Following the Merger, Holdings s common stock continued to trade on the over-the-counter market and continued to be quoted on the OTCQB marketplace under the same symbol,  USNU.   The conversion of shares of capital stock under the Merger Agreement occurred without an exchange of physical certificates.  Accordingly, physical certificates formerly representing shares of outstanding capital stock of USN are deemed to represent the same number of shares of capital stock of Holdings.

Pursuant to Section 251(g) of the DGCL, the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Holdings are substantially identical to those of USN prior to the date on which the Merger Agreement took effect.  The authorized capital stock of Holdings, the designations, rights, powers and preferences of such capital stock, and the qualifications, limitations and restrictions thereof are also substantially identical to those of the capital stock of USN immediately prior to the date of the Merger.  Further, the directors and executive officers of Holdings are the same individuals who were directors and executive officers, respectively, of USN immediately prior to the date of the Merger.

Note C   Destruction of Gamma Knife at NYU Medical Center; Replacement and Restoration 

USN opened its New York gamma knife treatment center in July 1997 on the campus of New York University ( NYU ) Medical Center.  USN installed a new Leksell gamma knife, the PERFEXION model, at the NYU Medical Center in March 2009 in replacement of the older gamma knife equipment.  In connection with this upgrade, USN modified its arrangement with NYU to extend the term for 12 years from March 2009.

In October 2012, USN s facility at NYU was totally destroyed as a result of flooding from Hurricane Sandy. The gamma knife had to be removed to prevent any cobalt leakage that might occur due to rusting of the equipment. The removal cost was $525,000. USN paid a lease settlement of the outstanding principal balance only and received from insurance coverage $930,000 above the lease principal payments and removal costs.

USN finalized arrangements with NYU regarding the restored gamma knife center and USN s long term contract with NYU in early 2014. USN s new facility, with the Leksell PERFEXION gamma knife, is located in the Tisch Hospital of NYU Langone Medical Center. The facility reopened and began receiving patients at the end of April 2014.

USN entered into a six year lease in the amount of $4.7 million for the purchase of the replacement equipment and associated leasehold improvements. The first payment of $78,000 was made on September 1, 2014, including $18,000 of interest, and the final payment is due on May 1, 2020. USN entered into a second two year lease in the amount of $250,000 for the cost of the construction required at the relocated site. The first payment of $12,000 was made on November 1, 2014, and the final payment was paid on July 1, 2016.

Table of Contents 

In April of 2016 USN entered into an agreement with Elekta for the installation of new ICON imaging technology in the NYU Gamma Knife equipment with a total cost, including sales taxes, of approximately $816,000. This ICON technology was installed during the month of July 2016 and the gamma knife center reopened on August 5, 2016. The Company has obtained lease financing of approximately $900,000 at an interest rate of approximately 4.45% to finance the acquisition of the ICON technology and associated installation costs. The monthly lease payment is expected to be approximately $20,500 to be paid over 48 months commencing October 2016, with the final payment to be made September 2020. A monthly maintenance agreement will commence a year after the installation date and is estimated to be about $6,000 per month.

In July of 2016 USN entered into an agreement with NYU regarding the installation of the new ICON technology.  Following the installation, NYU will adjust the monthly fee structure by adding $30,000 to the monthly payment for the remaining term of the agreement. A final payment of $17,000 will be made for the partial month of operations in March 2021.

The major terms of the agreement with NYU continue in effect, terminating at the end of March 2021.  USN is responsible for the maintenance and insurance for the gamma knife equipment at the NYU facility and is reimbursed for use of the gamma knife based on a fee per procedure performed with the equipment.  NYU provides the medical and technical staff to operate the facility.  At the end of the contract term, costs associated with closing and restoring the NYU facility to its original condition are the responsibility of USN.

Note D   The Southern California Regional Gamma Knife Center 

During 2007, the Company managed the formation of the Southern California Regional Gamma Knife Center at San Antonio Regional Hospital ( SARH ) in Upland, California.  The Company participates in the ownership and operation of the center through its wholly-owned subsidiary, USN Corona, Inc. ( USNC ).  Corona Gamma Knife, LLC ( CGK ) is party to a 14-year agreement with SARH to renovate space in the hospital and install and operate a Leksell PERFEXION gamma knife.  CGK leases the gamma knife from NeuroPartners LLC, which holds the gamma knife equipment.  In addition to returns on its ownership interests, USNC expects to receive fees for management services relating to the facility.

USNC is a 20% owner of NeuroPartners LLC and owns 39% of CGK.

Table of Contents 

USNC was a 20% guarantor on NeuroPartners, LLC s seven-year lease with respect to the gamma knife equipment and certain leasehold improvements at SARH.  In February 2016, NeuroPartners, negotiated a new five- year lease to fund the reloading of cobalt and the necessary construction to do so. The new lease of $1,663,000 includes a balance of $668,000 from the prior lease obligations. This new lease will be paid over 60 months. The first payment of $31,000 was paid on April 1, 2016 and the final payment will be due on March 1, 2021. The Company continues to be a 20% guarantor on the new lease and expects any potential obligations from this guarantee would be reduced by the recovery of the related collateral and expects any amounts arising from this guarantee to be insignificant.

Construction of the SARH gamma knife center was completed in December 2008 and the first patient was treated in January 2009.  The project has been funded principally by outside investors.  While the Company has led the effort in organizing the business and overseeing the development and operation of the SARH center, its investment to date in the SARH center has been minimal.

The Company s share of cumulative losses associated with its investment in NeuroPartners LLC and CGK has exceeded its investment.  Due to the outstanding loans made to NeuroPartners LLC and CGK, NeuroPartners LLC and CGK are considered to be variable interest entities of the Company.  However, as the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of NeuroPartners LLC and CGK, since it does not have the power to direct the operating activities that most significantly affect NeuroPartners LLC s and CGK s economic performance, certain disclosures are required rather than consolidation.  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company received $20,000 of repayments of amounts previously advanced to NeuroPartners LLC and GCK. Those repayments reduced the amount of loses incurred on prior advances to NeruoPartners LLC and CGK and are included as additional income from investments in unconsolidated entities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company has $116,000 of remaining advances to NeuroPartners LLC and CGK at September 30, 2016.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s equity in loss of NeuroPartners LLC and CGK was $4,000, but was not recorded due to prior losses.

Note E   Florida Oncology Partners 

During the quarter ended September 30, 2010, the Company participated in the formation of Florida Oncology Partners, LLC ( FOP ) and Florida Oncology Partners RE, LLC ( FOPRE ), which operates a cancer center located in West Kendall (Miami), Florida.  The center diagnoses and treats patients utilizing a Varian Rapid Arc linear accelerator and a GE CT scanner. USNC originally invested $200,000 for 20% ownership interest in FOP and FOPRE. The remaining 80% was owned by other outside investors. In January of 2015, one of the investors was removed from the entities, and his ownership interest was distributed among the remaining members in relationship to the percentage they owned. This distribution resulted in an increase of ownership interest for the Company of 4% in each entity. As of January 1, 2015, the Company has a 24% ownership in both FOP and FOPRE.

The center opened and treated its first patient in May 2011. During 2012 and 2013, FOP made several distributions that reduced the Company s investment significantly.  The Company s recorded investment in FOP and FOPRE is $200,000 and $225,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Amounts due from FOP and FOPRE included in due from related parties total $0 and $21,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.

During 2011, Florida Oncology Partners, LLC entered into a seven year capital lease with Key Bank for approximately $5,800,000. Under the terms of the capital lease, USN agreed to guarantee a maximum of $1,433,000, approximately 25% of the original lease obligation in the event of default. It is a guarantor jointly with most of the other members (except USNC who is not a named guarantor) of FOP.  The outstanding balance on the lease obligation was $1,780,000 at September 30, 2016. The Company expects any potential obligations from this guarantee would be reduced by the recoveries of the respective collateral and has recorded a liability of $11,000 associated with this guarantee at September 30, 2016.

In June 2012, FOPRE completed the financing agreement to purchase the building that is occupied by FOP.  The amount of the loan was $1,534,000 and was to be paid at a monthly rate of approximately $8,500 for 120 months with the final payment due on June 15, 2022. In December 2015, FOPRE sold the building, for a gain on sale of $577,000. The Company s share of the gain was $139,000. The related mortgage was repaid upon closing of the sale.

In December of 2015, FOP entered into an agreement with 21 st  Century Oncology for the purchase of FOP s Varian machine and other medical equipment. 21 st  Century Oncology paid FOP $1,000,000 as a down payment for the machine and other medical equipment and is currently making monthly payments of $172,000 for the machine, and making all monthly payments due under the capital lease, until such time as the sale is finalized. 21 st  Century has not to date satisfied all of the terms of the rental agreement and on May 1, June 1, and July 1, of 2016 it has paid an additional $30,000 in accelerated payments each month, and since August 1, 2016 it has paid $50,000 in accelerated payments each month. These accelerated payments have been recorded as unearned revenue.

Note F   Boca Oncology Partners 

During the quarter ended June 30, 2011, the Company participated in the formation of Boca Oncology Partners, LLC ( BOP ), for the purpose of owning and operating a cancer center in Boca Raton, Florida.  In June 2011, Boca Oncology Partners RE, LLC ( BOPRE ), an affiliated entity, purchased a 20% interest in Boca West IMP, LLC ( Boca West IMP ), owner of a medical office building in West Boca, Florida in which BOP operates.  BOP occupies approximately 6,000 square feet of the 32,000 square foot building.  The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, USNC invested $225,000 initially and had a 22.5% interest in BOP and BOPRE.

In January 2012, an additional investor purchased 50% of the partnership reducing the Company s ownership to 11.25%.  The Company loaned the proceeds of $56,250 back to BOP as a 5 year note at 7% interest. The remaining 88.75% was owned by other outside investors.  In June 2012, BOPRE purchased an additional 3.75% of Boca West IMP from another investor bringing its total interest to 23.75%. BOPRE accounts for this investment under the cost method since it does not exercise significant influence over Boca West IMP. Then the members of BOPRE sold 31.5% of their interests in BOPRE to a new investor. The proceeds of $28,000 were loaned to BOP and USNC s investment in BOPRE was reduced to 15.4%.

Although the Company reduced its investment to 11.25% of BOP and 15.4% of BOPRE, the Company continues to account for these investments under the equity method due to its participation in the management of the administration and accounting functions of BOP and BOPRE. Due to the outstanding loans made to BOP, BOP was considered to be a variable interest entity of the Company.  However, as the Company was not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of BOP, since it did not have the power to direct the operating activities that most significantly affect BOP s economic performance, certain disclosures are required rather than consolidation.  The center opened in August 2012.

In February 2014, the Company and other members sold their interests in BOP.

The Company s recorded investment in BOPRE is $137,000 at September 30, 2016 and $139,000 at December 31, 2015.

USNC is a 10% guarantor on 50% of the outstanding balance of Boca West IMP s ten-year mortgage.  This mortgage had an original balance of $3,000,000 and is secured by the medical office building in which BOP operates. The outstanding balance on the mortgage is $2,554,000 at September 30, 2016.  The Company expects any potential obligations from this guarantee would be reduced by the recovery of the real estate and expects any amounts arising from this guarantee to be insignificant.

    Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Critical Accounting Policies 

The condensed consolidated financial statements of U.S. Neurosurgical Holdings, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  As such, some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements.  A summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements, in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In particular, judgment is used in areas such as determining and assessing possible asset impairments and determination of the asset retirement obligation.

The following discussion and analysis provides information which the Company s management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company s results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein.

Results of Operation 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015

Patient revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $722,000, a decrease of 6% compared to $772,000 the previous year. This decrease in revenue was largely due to an increased number of procedures at NYU and a true-up to the effective rate per procedure in the current quarter, partly offset by an amendment to the Company s agreement with NYU resulting in $30,000 of additional revenue per month for the months of August and Sepember 2016. Patient expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $321,000 and $314,000 respectively.

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $298,000 and $291,000 for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015 respectively. This 2% increase was due to an increase in flood insurance to protect the new ICON technology at the NYU gamma knife center.

The Company incurred $34,000 of interest expense in the third quarter of 2016 related to the capital lease. Interest expense for the same period in 2015 was $47,000. The decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the fact that the final payment for the leasehold improvement lease was paid in July of 2016, and a lower principal balance remaining on the Company s gamma knife capital lease.

16 

Table of Contents 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized an income tax charge of $83,000. The 2016 tax expense is due to the Company s successful operations at NYU during 2016, and higher income from investments in unconsolidated entities.

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported a net income of $120,000 as compared to a net income of $90,000 for the same period a year earlier. The increase in net income is primarily due to successful operations at NYU and higher income from investments in unconsolidated entities.

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine months ended June 30 September 30, 2015

Patient revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,329,000, an increase of 3% compared to $2,253,000 the previous year. This increase in revenue was largely due to an additional $30,000 of revenue per month for the months of August and September 2016, following the installation of the new ICON technology at NYU in August 2016. Patient expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $933,000, an increase of 7% as compared to the $875,000 reported for the comparable period in the previous year. This increase in patient expenses was largely due to a new maintenance agreement, which went into effect as of April 1, 2015. The first year of maintenance was included in the installation of the equipment.

Selling, general and administrative expense of $959,000 for the first nine months of 2016 was consistent with the $958,000 incurred during the comparable period in 2015.

The Company incurred $114,000 of interest expense in the first nine months of 2016 related to the capital lease. Interest expense for the same period in 2015 was $137,000. The lower interest expense in 2016 is primarily due to the final payment of the leasehold improvement loan being made in July of 2016 and a lower principal balance remaining on the Company s gamma knife lease.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized an income tax charge of $306,000. The 2016 tax expense is due to the Company s successful operations at NYU during 2016, and higher income from investments in unconsolidated entities.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported a net income of $495,000 as compared to a net income of $201,000 for the same period a year earlier. The increase in net income is primarily due to successful operations at NYU and higher income from investments in unconsolidated entities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $1,354,000 as compared to $549,000 at December 31, 2015.  This increase was primarily due to the successful operations at NYU. Cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 were $2,320,000 as compared to $1,068,000 at December 31, 2015.

With respect to the notes receivable of $210,000 at September 30, 2016, the Company has been in discussions with one of the borrowers regarding the possible future conversion of one of the notes in the principal amount of $172,500 into an equity interest in a future business activity.  As a result, that note receivable has been classified as a non-current asset.

Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,416,000 as compared to $1,365,000 in the same period a year earlier. The increase was primarily due to cash inflows from the operation of the new gamma knife center, net of working capital requirements. Accounts receivable decreased $377,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to a decrease of $135,000 the previous year.

With respect to financing activities, the Company paid $672,000 towards its capital lease obligations during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $652,000 in 2015.

USN entered into a six year lease in the amount of $4.7 million for the purchase of the replacement Leksell PERFEXION gamma knife at the NYU Medical Center. The first payment of $78,000 was made on September 1, 2014, and the final payment is due on May 1, 2020. USN entered into a second two year lease in the amount of $250,000 for the cost of the construction required at the relocated site. The first payment of $12,000 was made on November 1, 2014, and the final payment which was due on July 1, 2016, has been made. The agreement with NYU to operate the gamma knife facility continues through March 2021.

In April of 2016 USN entered into an agreement with Elekta for the installation of new ICON imaging technology in the NYU Gamma Knife equipment with a total cost, including sales taxes, of approximately $816,000. This ICON technology was installed during the month of July 2016 and the gamma knife center reopened on August 5, 2016. The Company has obtained lease financing of approximately $900,000 at an interest rate of 4.45% to finance the acquisition of the ICON technology and associated installation costs. The monthly lease payment is expected to be approximately $20,500 to be paid over 48 months commencing October 2016, with the final payment to be made September 2020. A monthly maintenance agreement will commence a year after the installation date and is estimated to be about $6,000 per month.

Reliance on Business of the New York University Gamma Knife Center; Recent Destruction of Equipment and Discontinuation of Business at NYU    .    While it is the Company s objective to expand activities to additional cancer centers that rely on a broad range of diagnostic and radiation treatments, the Company has relied on the NYU gamma knife for substantially all of its revenue.  In recent periods, services provided at NYU have represented over 90% of the Company s revenues.  Unless and until the Company is successful in building its activities at other centers and at new locations, disruptions at NYU could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.

Availability of Working Capital    .    To date, we have earned sufficient income from operations to fund periodic operating losses and support efforts to pursue new gamma knife or other types of cancer treatment centers.

Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements 

The Securities and Exchange Commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions.  This document contains such "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, particularly statements anticipating future growth in revenues and cash flow.  Words such as "anticipates," "estimates," "expects," "projects," "targets," "intends," "plans," "believes," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance identify such forward-looking statements.  Those forward-looking statements are based on management's present expectations about future events.  As with any projection or forecast, they are inherently susceptible to uncertainty and changes in circumstances, and the Company is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements whether as a result of such changes, new information, future events or otherwise.

The Company operates in a highly competitive and rapidly changing environment and in businesses that are dependent on our ability to: achieve profitability; increase revenues; sustain our current level of operations; maintain satisfactory relations with business partners; attract and retain key personnel; maintain and expand our strategic alliances; and protect our intellectual property.  The Company's actual results could differ materially from management's expectations because of changes in such factors.  New risk factors can arise and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on the Company's business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.  Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.

Investors should also be aware that while the Company might, from time to time, communicate with securities analysts, it is against the Company's policy to disclose to them any material non-public information or other confidential commercial information. Accordingly, investors should not assume that the Company agrees with any statement or report issued by any analyst irrespective of the content of the statement or report. Furthermore, the Company has a policy against issuing or confirming financial forecasts or projections issued by others.  Thus, to the extent that reports issued by securities analysts or others contain any projections, forecasts or opinions, such reports are not the responsibility of the Company.

    Controls and Procedures

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  We do realize that we are a very small company and as a small company with only the officers and directors participating in the day to day management, with the ability to override controls, each officer and director has multiple positions and responsibilities that would normally be distributed among several employees in larger organizations with adequate segregation of duties to ensure the appropriate checks and balances.  Because the Company does not currently have a separate chief financial officer, the Chief Executive Officer performs these functions with the support of one of the Company s outside directors who assists in the reporting and disclosure process (the  Lead Director ).

Our management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based upon that evaluation the Company s Chief Executive Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of the period covered by this report for the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below.

Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The Company s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016, A material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the assessment described above, management identified the following material weakness as of September 30, 2016: the Company did not maintain sufficient qualified personnel with the appropriate level of knowledge, experience and training in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and in internal controls over financial reporting commensurate with its financial reporting requirements. Specifically, effective controls were not designed and in place to ensure that the Company maintained, or had access to, appropriate resources with adequate experience and expertise in the area of financial reporting for transactions such as investments in unconsolidated entities and income taxes. The Company is in the process of developing efficient approaches to remediate this material weakness.  To do this in a cost-effective manner, considering the current extent of the Company s operations, management is making arrangements with consultants and advisors to assist on an as-needed basis.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

While there have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, management is in the process of developing plans to remediate the material weakness identified above.
