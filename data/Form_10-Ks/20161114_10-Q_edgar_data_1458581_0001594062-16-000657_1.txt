Notes to the Financial Statements  

(Unaudited)  

1.           Nature of operations 

Zenosense, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 11, 2008, for the purpose of acquiring and developing mineral properties. In May 2013, the Company terminated its mineral development business. 

On November 22, 2013, the Company filed a certificate of amendment with the State of Nevada to change its name from  Braeden Valley Mines, Inc.  to  Zenosense, Inc.  and to increase the Company s authorized shares of common stock from 50,000,000 to 500,000,000, par value $0.001 per share. 

Effective December 4, 2013, the Company entered into a development and exclusive license agreement ( License Agreement ) whereby the Company will provide a third party with capital for the development of the sensory   technology for a methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus / Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA/SA ) detection device and other improvements and variations to the products based on that technology (the  Sgenia Products ) to be used in the hospital and health care environments, in exchange for a worldwide, exclusive license to manufacture, market and sell the resulting Sgenia Products, subject to certain limitations and a royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing basis. The License Agreement was modified in April 2014 and July 2014 to extend it to cancer sensory products and to modify and extend the development schedule and change the research funding budget to accommodate a lung cancer product as well as the MRSA/SA product. 

On June 20, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement by way of a Subscription and Shareholders  Agreement ( MML SSA ) with a third party medical detection device developer ( Partner ) utilizing a joint venture vehicle, MIDS Medical Ltd ( MML ), a UK Limited company.  As of July 1, 2016, the Company owns a 40% interest in MML in exchange for providing funding to MML during a Phase 1 and prospectively during a Phase 2 development of a universal immunoassay detection technology platform ( MIDS ) with an initial focus on the development of a novel Point of Care ( POC ) cardiac device ( MIDS Cardiac  ). MML will have the right, under license from the Partner, to use the MIDS Intellectual Property ( MIDS IP ) during the development and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the event MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party. 

The MIDS technology will incorporate what we believe to be a novel microfluidic strip design, magnetic nanoparticle manipulation, and a unique double detection technique using bespoke  Hall Effect  sensors and a bespoke optical sensor which, when combined, will increase significantly the sensitivity and accuracy of the result.   

The MIDS technology platform has the potential to be adaptable to a large array of other POC immunoassay tests, taking them to a whole new level of accuracy, lower cost, ease of use, and speed of testing.  We believe that such a multi-capability POC device, with laboratory gold standard accuracy, could be used to test for conditions such as Chlamydia, prostate, colorectal and other cancers, stroke, sports anti-doping, drugs of abuse, insulin levels, H. Pylori, inflammatory   autoimmune disease, influenza, Legionella, osteoporosis, endocrine levels, respiratory viruses, pneumonia, blood infections, streptococcus, meningitis, rheumatism, hepatitis, HIV, Viral infection, among others. 

2.           Basis of presentation 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Zenosense, Inc. have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on May 23, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein.  The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as reported on Form 10-K, have been omitted. 

3.           Going Concern 

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which assumes that the Company will be able to meet its obligations and continue its operations for 12 months.  Realization values may be substantially different from carrying values as shown and these financial statements do not give effect to adjustments that would be necessary to the carrying values and classification of assets and liabilities should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had not yet achieved profitable operations, had accumulated losses of $1,446,565 since its inception and expects to incur further losses in the development of its business, all of which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. 

The Company expects to continue to incur substantial losses as it executes its business plan and pursue its investment in MML and does not expect to attain profitability in the near future. Since its inception, the Company has funded its operations through short-term borrowings, advances, and equity investments. The Company's future operations are dependent upon external funding and its ability to execute its business plan, realize sales and control expenses.  Management believes that sufficient funding will be available from additional borrowings and private placements to be able to meet its business objectives, including its anticipated cash needs for working capital for the next fiscal year.  However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain sufficient funds to continue the pursuing its currently planned business operations, or if obtained, whether the funding will be on terms acceptable and/or favorable to the Company.

4.           Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Use of estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Reclassifications 

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year financial statements to conform with the current year presentation. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

Cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash on hand, demand deposits and short-term, highly liquid investments with an original maturity of ninety days or less. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash and cash equivalents. 

Investments in unconsolidated Affiliates 

We apply the equity method of accounting where we can exert significant influence over, but do not control or direct, the policies, decisions or activities of the entity. We use the cost method of accounting where we are unable to exert significant influence over the entity. Entities are required to periodically review their equity and cost method investments to determine whether current events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments may be impaired. We evaluate our cost method investment for impairment when there are indicators of impairment. If indicators suggest impairment we will perform an impairment test to assess whether an adjustment is necessary. The impairment test considers whether the fair value of our cost method investment has declined and if any such decline is other than temporary. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary, the investment s carrying value is written down to fair value. 

Research and development 

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 

Income taxes 

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between their financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 

Loss per common share 

Basic loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and potentially dilutive securities outstanding during each period. 

Subsequent events 

The Company evaluated all events or transactions that occurred after September 30, 2016, up through the date these financial statements were issued and no subsequent events occurred that required disclosure in the accompanying financial statements. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 

The Company does not expect the adoption of any recent accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on its financial statements.

5.           Equity Method Investment 

On June 20, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement with the Partner, using the joint venture vehicle, MML, a UK limited company. The Company owns a 40% interest in MML. MML is developing the Partner s MIDS universal immunoassay detection technology with an initial focus on developing a novel POC cardiac device that would be a hand held device able to support high sensitivity tests of various cardiac biomarkers to definitively identify or discount AMI, with accuracy equal or better than gold standard laboratory tests, within minutes. 

The Company accounts for its investment in MML using equity method of accounting 

The Company evaluated its relationship with MML to determine if it was a variable interest entity ( VIE ) as defined in ASC 810-10 and whether the Company was the primary beneficiary of MML, in which case consolidation with the Company would be required. The Company determined that MML qualifies as a VIE but the Company is not considered as the primary beneficiary. The Company s investment in MML qualifies for the equity method of accounting since the Company has the ability to exert significant influence over MML through common ownership and management 

Through September 30, 2016, the Company has invested $160,000 in MML. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized $1,710 loss in its equity method investment in MML. 

6.           Loans Payable 

On November 2, 2015, four promissory notes (the  Prior Notes ) previously owed to a third party were assigned to a new party (the    Note Holder ) for a total of $110,000 in principal, plus accrued interest of $3,647 as of that date. The Prior Notes bear interest of 5% and are due on demand.  At May 17, 2016, the Company had accrued interest of $5,744 in connection with the Prior Notes. 

On March 29, 2016, the Note Holder gave notice that it demanded repayment of all principal amounts and accrued interest outstanding on the Prior Notes, due within 90 days of the demand notice. No further action was taken in respect of the demand; however, on May 17, 2016, the Note Holder agreed to exchange the Prior Notes and accrued interest then totaling $115,744 for two new convertible notes. 

7.           Convertible Debt 

On April 20, 2016, the Note Holder agreed to a loan of $40,000, and the Company issued a convertible note in a principal amount of $40,000 (the    April 2016 Note ).  The April 2016 Note bears interest at 5% per annum and is due on April 19, 2018.  The April 2016 Note may not be prepaid.  As of September 20, 2016, the April 2016 Note became convertible into shares of common stock (the    Conversion   ) of the Company, at the discretion of the holder, at a price of $0.007 per share, subject to a blocker provision that limits the amount of common stock that may be issued at any time to 4.99% of the then outstanding shares of common stock.  The Company has initially reserved 5,714,286 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion feature. 

On May 17, 2016, the Note Holder agreed to exchange the Prior Notes (see note 6) for two new convertible notes (the  May 2016 Notes ) under two separate Securities Exchange Agreements.  One note is for the principal amount of $53,197 and the other for the principal amount of $62,547, for a combined aggregate principal amount of $115,744.  The May 2016 Notes bear interest at 5% per annum, are due on May 16, 2018 and may not be prepaid by the Company. The May 2016 Notes can be converted into shares of common stock of the Company at the discretion of the holder, at a price of $0.007 per share, subject to a blocker provision that limits the amount of common stock that may be issued at any time to 4.99% percent of the outstanding shares of common stock.  The Company has initially reserved 16,534,857 shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion feature. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had accrued interest of $3,230 in connection with the April 2016 and the May 2016 Notes. 

The April 2016 and May 2016 Notes have a beneficial conversion feature with a combined intrinsic value of $155,744 for the three notes as of September 30, 2016. The intrinsic value is based upon the difference between the market price of Zenosense s common stock on the date of issuance and the conversion price of $0.007 The discount is being amortized through an interest expense using the straight line method over the term of the notes. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded amortization of $30,495 on the debt discount. 

On September 29, 2016, the Company issued an unsecured convertible note (the  October 2016 Note ) in the principal amount of $60,000, to the Note Holder in exchange of a loan of $60,000. Under the October 2016 Note, the Company also granted an option  to the Note Holder to provide four additional unsecured convertible loans to the Company (the  Option Loans ), in the following amounts: (a) on or before October 31, 2016, an amount of $140,000; (b) on or before November 30, 2016, an amount of $170,000 (c) on or before January 31, 2017, an amount of $180,000; and (d) on or before March 31, 2017, an amount of $100,000.  

The terms and conditions of certain commitment loans (see Note 8 below), the Option Loans and the October 2016 Note (collectively the  New Loans ) are the same (conversion and floor prices having been adjusted in line with the terms of the commitment loans at the time of the reverse stock split completed on August 4, 2016), and bear an interest rate of 10% per annum, based on a 360 day year, and are due four years from the issuance date (the  Maturity Date ). The Company may, at any time prior to the Maturity Date, prepay any unconverted amount of the New Loans in full or in part. The Note Holder may, at any time prior to the Maturity Date convert any or all of the New Loans into shares of common stock of the Company (the  Common Stock ) at either (a) $0.07 per share (subject to adjustment), or (b) a 15% discount to the 10-day Volume Weighted Average Price per share, provided that any such conversion is not at a price of less than $0.035 per share (subject to adjustment). In either scenario the total number of shares of Common Stock issued on conversion may not cause the total beneficial ownership held by the Investor and its affiliates, or the Note Holder and its affiliates to exceed 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. On the Maturity Date of each of the New Loans any outstanding amount shall automatically and mandatorily convert into Common Stock at a price of $0.07 per share (subject to adjustment). The New Loans also contain standard anti-dilution provisions. 

The Company evaluated the October 2016 Note to have a beneficial conversion features with an intrinsic value of $53,486. The intrinsic value is based upon the difference between the market price of Zenosense s common stock on the date of issuance and the conversion price of $0.07. The discount is being amortized through an interest expense using the straight line method over the term of the notes. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded amortization of $41 on the debt discount.

8.           Common Stock 

On June 6, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) with an accredited investor (the  Investor ).  The transaction closed on June 8, 2016. 

Under the terms of the SPA; the Investor purchased 9,589,512 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share, for a purchase price of $150,000 and a commitment by the Investor to provide a series of unsecured convertible loans (the  Commitment Loans ) in an aggregate loan amount of $640,000, payable in four individual amounts, the first payment due by September 20, 2016, the Note Holder retaining the right of first refusal on the Commitment Loans. The first Commitment Loan was not entered into due to the capital requirements of the Company being less than anticipated, primarily due to lower than expected MML development costs during the quarter, which allowed for an amendment to the MML funding obligations of the Company. Consequently, the Company issued the October 2016 Note in the amount of $60,000 rather than draw upon the Commitment Loans. 

On September 29, 2016, the Investor, the Company and the Note Holder entered into an amendment to the SPA pursuant to which the Investor, the Note Holder and the Company agreed that should the Note Holder elect to provide the Option Loans, the Investor will not be required to, or will it be permitted to, provide the Commitment Loans. In the event the Note Holder does not provide the Option Loans, the Investor will be required to provide the Commitment Loans in an amended aggregate amount of $580,000, on dates and in amounts to be agreed between the Investor and the Company. 

After the close of the stock market on August 3, 2016, the Company implemented a 1-for-7 reverse split of its common stock. All share and per share data in these financial statements and footnotes have been retrospectively adjusted to account for this reverse stock split. 

9.           Commitments 

Sgenia License Agreement  

On December 4, 2013, the Company entered into a License Agreement with Sgenia Industrial S.L. and its subsidiaries, Sgenia Soluciones S.L and ZENON Biosystem S.L (collectively,  Sgenia ) for the development of the Sgenia Products, to be based on the Sgenia sensory technology.  Pursuant to the License Agreement, the Company will obtain a worldwide exclusive license to manufacture, market and sell the resulting Sgenia Products, subject to certain limitations and a royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing basis. The Company entered into three amendments (the  Amendments ) to the License Agreement to modify and extend the Sgenia Products to include a lung cancer product and change the product development schedule and the research funding budget to accommodate the additional lung cancer product as well as the continuation of the development of the MRSA/SA product. 

Additionally, the objectives of the development stages and the milestones were modified to reflect the current state of development of each of the Sgenia Products. Under the License Agreement, the Company is funding the development of the Sgenia Products pursuant to a research and development plan proposed by Sgenia and accepted by the Company. The funding will be provided on an advance basis, per month, based on agreed development stages. In return, the Company will have the exclusive right to manufacture, formulate, package, market and sell the Sgenia Products world-wide, for 40 years, subject to a limitation on the inclusion of Spain in the territory. All intellectual property developed by Sgenia at any time during the term related to manufacturing, formulating and/or packaging process shall be shared ownership and licensed to  the Company on a royalty-free basis. 

Sgenia will also supply to the Company, at a negotiated price based on quantity, all of the requirements for the integrated circuits on microchips that are necessary for the operation of the Sgenia Products. Sgenia and the Company will also work together to research and develop the Sgenia Products and establish written plans and reviewing committees for the management of the overall development project and commercialization of the Sgenia Products. 

The Company s funding of the MRSA/SA product development was limited to an initial approved budget of $1,256,438, of which $526,846 was advanced by the Company.  As a result of the Amendment of July 2014, the revised and approved budget is approximately $1,142,143, of which $769,787 has been advanced (including the amount advanced under the prior budget) as of September 30, 2016. The Company is currently committed to advancing approximately EUR656,000 (approximately $718,000), for research and development under the revised and approved budget, and subject to Sgenia meeting certain milestones. Some of the milestones have not been met as of September 30, 2016, reflecting a slowing of the research and development of the Sgenia Products. The Company cannot determine at this time whether or not the Sgenia Products will be fully developed, which will also limit the funding obligations of the Company under the License Agreement. The aggregate of the advances paid by the Company are recorded as research and development expenses. The budget may be changed by mutual agreement from time to time. 

In addition to providing the development funding, the Company will also pay royalties for completed sales of the Sgenia Products, payable 60 days after each fiscal quarter of the Company (the  Royalties ). The Royalties will be 20% of net sales, which is calculated based on gross sales of the device and the installation and training for the Sgenia Products, less various expenses, including manufacturing, components acquired from Sgenia, commissions, refunds and discounts and sales taxes. If the Sgenia Products are sold by Sgenia in Spain for original use in Spain, then the Royalties on those sales will be reduced. The Company also has the right to sublicense to other parties throughout the world, except in Spain if and when, if at all, Sgenia seeks to act as the distributor in that territory. 

The Company has the option to fund the development of future proposed products based on the Sgenia intellectual property, and if funded the Company will obtain the right to manufacture, market and sell the resulting devices. 

MML Funding Arrangement  

The Company s funding of MML was limited to an initial committed aggregate payment of  450,500 (approximately $650,000 at exchange rates prevailing at the time of the MML SSA) for Phase 1 of which $160,000 has been paid. In addition, the Company may be required to provide an additional  45,000 (approximately $55,000 at current exchange rates) to be available after March 31, 2017,  payable within 20 days after the Company received written notice from MML. 

On September 29, 2016, the MML SSA commitment was amended to provide for the total amount of $650,000, payable under an amended timetable; all the other provisions of the MML SSA remained in force. Under the amendment, the Company has made payments to MML of $130,000 on August 2, 2016 and $30,000 on October 1, 2016. Subsequent payments are expected to be made as follows; (a) on or before October 31, 2016, a payment $110,000, (b) on or before November 30, 2016, a payment of $152,500; (c) on or before January 31, 2017 a payment of $152,500; and (d) on or before March 31, 2017 a payment of $75,000.

On December 5, 2013, the Company entered into a one-year service agreement with Mr. Carlos Jose Gil, through his consulting firm, Ksego Engineering S.L., under which the Company obtains his services as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  The agreement is now on a month-to-month basis. Mr. Gil receives a base salary and additional compensation, if any, to be equal to 10% of the net sales generated from the License Agreement. On August 12, 2016, the Company amended Mr. Carlos Jose Gil s service agreement to include additional compensation, if any, to be equal to 10% of the revenue received by Zenosense, Inc. from MML as a result of any future commercialization of the MIDS project.    

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $45,539 of general and administrative expenses related to amounts paid/owed to Ksego Engineering S.L. for services rendered by Mr. Gil. As of September 30, 2016, the Company owes Mr. Gil $85,671.  No additional compensation based on net sales has been earned to date. 

11.           Subsequent Events 

On October 18, 2016, the Note Holder entered into a Debt Purchase and Assignment Agreement (the  Assignment Agreement ) with an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Securities Act (the  Junior Holder ), whereby the Junior Holder purchased $42,000 of the principle amount of one of the May 2016 Notes. Under the terms of the Assignment Agreement; (a) the portion of the May 2016 Note held by the Junior Holder (such portion being referred to as the  Junior Note ) will be subordinate to the portion of the May 2016 Note held by the Note Holder (such portion being referred to as the  Senior Note ) and all other debt of the Note Holder issued by the Company at all times that the Company has any obligations under the Senior Note or any other debt securities issued to the Note Holder, and all actions requiring permission from the Note Holder as set out in the May 2016 Note and the Exchange Agreement will remain in place and the Junior Note will be amended to reflect these rights; and (b) the Junior Note will be amended whereby the Junior Holder will not be permitted to convert any of the Junior Note into shares of common stock of the Company unless the trading price of the Company s securities is equal to or greater than $0.15 per share based on the average volume weighted price of the preceding five trading days. 

On October 27, 2016, the Company issued an unsecured note (the  November 2016 Note ) in the principal amount of $140,000, to the Note Holder in exchange of a loan of $140,000. The November 2016 Note is the first out of the four Option Loans and the Note Holder retains the option to provide the balance of the Option Loans. The terms of the November 2016 Note are listed in note 7 above. 

On November 1, 2016, after notice from the Note Holder, the Company reissued one of the May 2016 Notes (the  $62,547 May 2016 Note )  in the amounts of $42,000 and $ 21,968 (which includes the full amount of the interest due through November 1, 2016 on the $62,547 May 2016 Note) under two separate new notes. The terms of the $42,000 note were modified to make it subordinate to the note in principal amount of $21.968, but otherwise the two notes are basically the same and generally carry forward the terms of the May 2016 Notes.

ITEM 2.                        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

Forward-Looking Statements 

This section of this quarterly report includes a number of forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.   Respective statements concerning the development of both MIDS Cardiac  and other devices under development have been made based on information obtained from MIDS Medical Ltd. and Zenon Biosystem, which the Company believes to be accurate, but have not been independently verified. 

As used in this quarterly report, the terms  we,   us,   our,   our company  and  Zenosense  mean Zenosense, Inc., unless otherwise indicated.  We have no subsidiaries aside from our 40% interest in MML. 

General Overview 

Zenosense, Inc. was incorporated on August 11, 2008 in the State of Nevada. In December 2013, we filed an amendment to our charter to change our name from  Braeden Valley Mines, Inc.  to  Zenosense, Inc.  and to increase the number of our authorized shares of Common Stock from 50,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares par value of $0.001. 

The original purpose of the company was to acquire and to develop mineral properties and to engage in the exploration for gold and other mineral properties.  On May 15, 2013, our mining lease expired and we lost our right to explore the mining property.  We then became a shell company, as defined under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, until December 4, 2013, when we entered into the transaction with Sgenia described below. 

In the summer of 2013, we started to look for new business opportunities.  We became interested in sensory technology devices for use in hospitals and health care environments.  During the latter part of the year, we began to negotiate a license agreement with the developers of such technology (the  Sgenia Technology ), and in December 2013, we entered into a Development and Exclusive License Agreement (the  License Agreement ) with Sgenia Industrial, S.L. ( Sgenia ) and its subsidiaries Sgenia Soluciones, S.L. ( Sgenia Subsidiary ) and ZENON Biosystem, S.L. ( Zenon ), all of which were formed under the laws of Spain. The products currently being developed under the License Agreement include one to be used in the detection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus/Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA/SA ) in the healthcare environment and another to be used to detect lung cancer in patients.  Under the terms of the License Agreement, we will provide Zenon with capital for the development of the devices that utilizes the Sgenia Technology (the  Sgenia Products ), in exchange for a worldwide, exclusive license to manufacture, formulate, market and sell the resulting products, subject to certain limitations and a royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing basis.  The License Agreement gives us additional rights to improvements and developments to the Sgenia Products and future products using the Sgenia Technology. 

In June 2016, we were presented the opportunity of involvement in a joint venture complementary to our current medical device development business plan and we entered into a joint venture to develop the MIDS technology. On June 20, 2016, we entered into a joint venture by way of the MML SSA with the Partner utilizing a joint venture vehicle, MML, a UK Limited company of which we own a 40% interest as of July 1, 2016. Our interest in MML was obtained in exchange for a funding commitment to support MML during a Phase 1 and prospectively during a Phase 2 development of the Partner s MIDS universal immunoassay detection technology platform. MML will have the right, under license, to use the MIDS IP during the development and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the event MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party. 

To fund our obligations under the License Agreement and MML SSA, to date we have sold shares of common stock on a private placement basis, issued convertible debt and converted funds advanced to the Company into common shares of the Company. 

Plan of Operation 

Our business plan is to develop devices to be used at the POC in hospitals and other medical care centers to detect AMI, MRSA/SA and the signs of lung cancer, and where necessary, to fund the medical trials of those medical devices. Up to June 20, 2016, our principal activity since December 2013 was funding the development of the Sgenia Products. Because the development activities of the Sgenia Products has slowed, and certain milestones have not been achieved, one of which is the start of hospital testing, we have not been providing additional funding for the development of the Sgenia Products. Additionally, we have not been successful in obtaining our funding for further development of the Sgenia Products. 

As a result of the our participation in MML, our primary focus since June 2016 has shifted to the funding and co-development of the MIDS technology platform to develop a hand held device, MIDS Cardiac , to be used at the POC for the early detection of low levels of certain cardiac biomarkers, using high sensitivity cardiac assays for the diagnosis of AMI. 

The MML SSA provides for a series of payments ( Phase 1 Payments ) in an aggregate amount of  450,500 (approximately $650,000 based on the rate of exchange on entering the MML SSA). The Company made a Phase 1 Payment to MML, of $130,000 (the  First Payment ), which was converted to  92,857. Subsequent Phase 1 Payments were expected to be received as follows; (a) on or before September 20, 2016, a payment  106,093, (b) on or before November 20, 2016, a payment of  100,640; (c) on or before January 20, 2017 a payment of  100,640; and (d) on or before March 20, 2017 a payment of  50,320. The MML SSA also provides for a contingency funding (the  Contingency ) to be available after March 31, 2017 in an aggregate amount of up to  45,000 (approximately $58,000) to be paid by us within 20 days of receiving a written notice from MML. 

On September 29, 2016, the Company amended the MML SSA (the  Amendment ) to postpone certain anticipated Phase 1 Payments. The outstanding Phase 1 Payments have been amended to be in the following amounts on specified dates: (a) on September 30, 2016, a payment of $30,000, which has been paid; (b) on or before October 30, 2016, a payment of $110,000; (c) on or before November 30, 2016, a payment of $152,500; (d) on or before January 30, 2017 a payment of $152,500; and (e) on or before March 31, 2017, a payment of $75,000, making the aggregated Phrase 1 Payments, including the first payment of $130,000, equal to $650,000. All other provisions and terms of the MML SSA, including the Contingency, remain in force. 

The parties to the MML SSA envisage a second phase of development ( Phase 2 ) to follow Phase 1. This is expected to be over a similar timeframe and at a similar cost. MML may independently obtain funding for Phase 2 at MML s option, or invite the Company to fund. 

4 

The MML SSA contains various provisions to govern our funding obligations: if any Phase 1 Payment is not made within 14 days of it falling due ( Default ), our shareholding in MML may be reduced to zero unless otherwise agreed with the Partner; if no Contingency is drawn during Phase 1 the Partner will be awarded an enduring 2.5% profit after tax right in MML ( Override ) which will increase to a 15% Override if we decline to fund Stage 2; if we decline to fund Phase 2 and any Contingency has been drawn, the Partner will be awarded a 15% Override decreased by 0.5% for each  7,500 tranche of Contingency drawn down during Phase 1. Any Override will convert on a ratio of 1% Override to 1% of ordinary shares in the event of a sale of MML. 

At no time prior to a sale will the Company s ownership interest in MML s shares be less than 30% unless the Company is in Default. Provided that each Phase 1 Payment is made within 14 days of falling due, the Company also has additional investor control rights over MML, including representation on the board of directors, rights over the appointment and employment of senior management persons, incurring indebtedness, entry into major transactions, budget approval rights, accounting practices and general operational management supervisory rights. 

As a condition of the MML SSA, MML has entered into Supply of Services Agreements under which it receives the services of key personnel related to the MIDS development. 

At September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $241,680. Our current cash assets are not sufficient to cover our current and expected expenses, including the contractual funding obligation under the License Agreement and the MML SSA, and therefore, we will need to obtain further financing, without which we will not be able to execute our business plan. 

In light of our current inability to fund our operations and fund the Sgenia license and the fact that the Sgenia research is delayed, we reviewed with Sgenia the development schedule and funding requirements for the initial products and requirements to develop the cancer sensory devices, and have agreed in principle to an alternative development schedule which would result in the lengthening of the developmental schedule for these products and an increase of the budget requirements. The schedule and funding will be finalized once we have obtained sufficient funding, for which we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to obtain. We have been attempting to secure the necessary funding to continue either the existing development schedule and corresponding budget or the alternative development schedule. 

Assuming that we are able to obtain operational funding, in addition to any funding necessary to maintain our status as a public company, subject to regular review and additional assessment of requirements, currently we anticipate that we will incur the following expenses over the twelve (12) month period following funding in connection with the development of the Sgenia Products and the MIDS technology: (1) we will have to fund our obligations under the terms of the MML SSA as amended in a minimum total amount of $490,000,(2) we will have to fund the future development expenses of Sgenia in the approximate amount of 683,000 euros, (3) payment of compensation to our officers, employees, and consultants of approximately $100,000, (4) legal, audit and reporting expenses of approximately $50,000, and (5) general working capital.  Additional unknown expenses may arise from time to time, which we cannot currently identify or determine a possible expense.  We will need additional funding to cover our anticipated expenses mentioned above, and for future development and implementation of our business plan.  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our total assets were $182,165 and $5,156, respectively, and our total current liabilities were $423,845 and $261,301 respectively.  As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $241,680.  Our financial statements report a net loss of $60,787 and $135,535 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

We have had recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed.  Our financial statements reflect that there is a going concern qualification. 

Currently, we have only limited cash and similar assets, which do not allow us to continue with the funding obligations of the license with Sgenia or our obligations under the MML SSA.  The License Agreement has not been declared in default. Further funding of the development project is not yet due as Sgenia has not completed the current stage of development terms. 

In 2016, we received $40,000 on April 26, 2016 as a loan from the Note Holder.  Funding obtained in 2014 and 2015, held by the Note Holder who acquired the Prior Notes, was consolidated into the May 2016 Notes. The April 2016 Note and the May 2016 Notes contain standard anti-dilution provisions and other customary representations, warranties and covenants by, among and for the benefit of the parties.  These notes   also include customary event of default provisions and impose penalties on the Company in certain default events. Additionally, the Note Holder has the right of first refusal in any future equity financing and impose restrictions on the Company s ability to make distributions to its shareholder, repurchase shares of Common Stock, incur certain liabilities or sell assets.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company is permitted to raise additional capital relating to the Development and Exclusive License Agreement, effective December 4, 2013, as amended.   

On June 6, 2016, we received a cash investment of $150,000 from the Investor in exchange for the issuance of 9,589,512 of common stock. The use of proceeds required the funds to be applied to participating in the MML project and for general working capital. The Investor was required to provide Commitment Loans in an aggregate amount of $640,000 to be applied to the Company s ongoing obligations under the MML SSA and for general working capital. On September 29, 2016, the Company issued the October Note in the principal amount of $60,000 to the Note Holder, in exchange of a loan of $60,000. Under the October Note, the Company also granted an option to the Note Holder to provide the Option Loans to the Company: (a) on or before October 31, 2016, an amount of $140,000; (b) on or before November 30, 2016, an amount of $170,000 (c) on or before January 31, 2017, an amount of $180,000; and (d) on or before March 31, 2017, an amount of $100,000. Simultaneously the Investor, the Company and the Note Holder entered into an amendment to the SPA pursuant to which the Investor, the Note Holder and the Company agreed that should the Note Holder elect to provide the Option Loans, the Investor will not be required to, nor will it be permitted to, provide the Commitment Loans. In the event the Note Holder does not provide the Option Loans, the Investor will be required to provide the Commitment Loans in an amended aggregate amount of $580,000, on dates and in amounts to be agreed between the Investor and the Company.

Results of Operations 

Overview  

The following discussion of the results of operations, cash flows and changes in our financial position should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are included in our Form 10-K, filed on May 23, 2016. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Our operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the three months ended September 30, 2015 are summarized as follows: 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are outlined in the table below: 

Research and development expenses have decreased as we have not been providing additional funding for the development of the Sgenia Products 

General and administrative expenses have decreased as a result of decreased consulting services and a decrease in our legal and accounting fees.  

Revenues 

We have earned no revenues since our inception. 

We have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Our operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are summarized as follows: 

Operating Expenses 

Our operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are outlined in the table below: 

Research and development expenses have decreased as we have not been providing additional funding for the development of the Sgenia Products 

General and administrative expenses have decreased as a result of decreased consulting services and a decrease in our legal and accounting fees.  

We had cash of $23,875 and $989 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. We had a working capital deficit of $241,680 as of September 30, 2016, compared to working capital deficit of $256,145 as of December 31, 2015. 

We used cash in operations of $67,114 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, principally for funding our corporate obligations and SEC reporting. We have not funded the Sgenia license during this three month period due to a lack of available funds and the fact that Sgenia and Zenon have not completed the preconditions for the next phase of funding. 

We used cash in investing activities of $160,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due under the MML SSA. 

We received $60,000 of cash proceeds from a loan during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received $100,000 of cash proceeds from two loans and $150,000 of cash proceeds from the sale of the Company s common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Based on our current operating plan, we will not generate revenue that is sufficient to cover our expenses for at least the next twelve (12) months.  In addition, we do not have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to execute our operations for at least the next twelve (12) months.  We will need to obtain additional financing to operate our business for the next twelve (12) months.  We expect to raise the capital necessary to fund our company through advances or a private placement and public offering of our common stock.  Additional financing, whether through public or private equity or debt financing, arrangements with stockholders or other sources to fund operations, may not be available, or if available, may be on terms unacceptable to us. 

Our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital.  If we issue additional equity securities to raise funds, the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced.  New investors may demand rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock. Debt incurred by us would be senior to equity in the ability of debt holders to make claims on our assets. The terms of any debt issued could impose restrictions on our operations.  If adequate funds are not available to satisfy either short or long-term capital requirements, our operations and liquidity could be materially adversely affected and we could be forced to cease operations. 

7 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Not Applicable. 

ITEM 4                          CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under the supervision and the participation of our management, consists of our principal executive officer (who is also our principal financial officer), we conducted an evaluation as of September 30, 2016, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer, who is also our principal financial officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016, because (1) the Company lacks a functioning audit committee and there is a lack of independent directors on the board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures;  (2) the Company has inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) the Company has ineffective controls over its period end financial disclosure and reporting processes. The Company operations are also ineffective due to the lack of operating funding. 

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting  

There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Additional Information on MML  

Demand is increasing for POC tests that can detect very low concentrations of a target analyte and quantify the result.  Current lateral flow based immunoassays can only detect analyte at high levels of concentration.  However, at low concentration levels, the assay system requires amplification either of the signal or the target, which will typically increase the complexity and the costs of the testing device.  Consequently, current POC tests remain largely unreliable for targets that require quantification. 

We believe there to be an opportunity to develop a universal immunoassay based POC testing system which: 

Is capable of detecting biomarkers at a nanoparticle level, providing fully quantitative measurement of results i.e. giving a numerical value for each biomarker detected and not just an indication on whether a specified biomarker is actually present, 

Is capable of multiplexing i.e. performing multiple types of test from the same sample, 

Provides full connectivity and networking for collection, storage and transfer of data and results, 

Displays test results in minutes (less than 8 minutes for a panel of up to 3 tests), 

Requires a finger prick sample size for a single test, 

Utilizes a handheld reader and single disposable cartridge designed to be operated by a minimally trained person, requiring modest manual operation, other than for sample collection, 

Contains all necessary reagents and where all steps are automated into an integrated encompassing pre-treatment, analyte specific reaction, signal production, signal reaction and final result: from sample to result in one step, 

Can be adapted to perform different immunoassays for testing in areas such as infectious diseases, drugs of abuse or oncology, especially where rapid diagnosis is critical, and 

Has a simple system design, requiring minimal direct input costs and inline manufacturing processes to keep unit costs as low as possible. 

The MML plan is to develop the MIDS platform initially for the cardiac marker POC testing market, these markers being measured to evaluate heart function.  Cardiac markers are used in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome.  The detection of these markers is used to diagnose acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) and its severity, typically Troponin (cTnI or cTnT), myoglobin and Creatine kinase MB isoenzyme (CK-MB). 

9 

Standard procedure for chest pain patients is an immediate ECG, complemented by blood tests for the cardiac markers Troponin I or T, to diagnose AMI. However, the sensitivity of an ECG is recognized as only around 55%-75% accurate. And these standard Troponin tests provide only guidance; as Troponin levels rise over time and are difficult to detect during the early stages. The solution is the detection of very low levels of cardiac markers (Troponin I and T) using high sensitivity cardiac Troponin assays (biomarker detection/measurement process). Gold standard laboratory analyzers currently required to run these tests can give up to a 99.6% Negative Predictive Value (the probability of no AMI): two thirds of suspect patients might be  ruled out  and safely discharged early. However, laboratory analyzers are located centrally, extremely expensive and slow to turnaround results (typically 60 minutes). 

MML intends to develop its unique technology platform into a hand-held device for use anywhere, designed to equal or exceed gold standard laboratory levels of accuracy. MML believes it can develop a cardiac device, MIDS Cardiac  , with a number of key features; a) deliver definitive results at the POC within minutes with a single Troponin I or T test within 3 minutes and three panel test (additional cardiac biomarkers) within 8 minutes, b) accuracy equal or superior to gold standard laboratory high sensitivity assays, c) patient friendly requiring a market leading 5 microliter finger prick blood sample per tested analyte, d) automated operation suitable for use by minimally trained personnel and, e) at a fraction of the cost of laboratory analyzers and results not requiring interpretation from specialized medical personnel. 

The global market for cardiac biomarker diagnostic tests is projected to reach $7.2 billion by 2018, of which $1.16 billion is expected to be served by POC devices. The POC market is in its infancy; existing POC hand held devices not accurate or reliable enough to definitively exclude AMI. MML s ultimate goal is to match or exceed current gold standard  high-sensitivity cardiac assays, currently carried out on relatively slow, hugely expensive laboratory analyzers. One multinational diagnostic company claiming the highest levels of accuracy on the market for a POC cardiac marker device, in reality achieves a mere 65% sensitivity. This poor sensitivity comes nowhere near what MML believes the MIDS Cardiac  can achieve. Despite the shortcomings of  POC cardiac devices currently on the market, 100 s of millions of dollars per year are generated from device and strip sales which only aid the diagnosis of AMI in conjunction with ECG and clinical symptoms. Should the development of MIDS Cardiac  be successful we believe the device will deliver unparalleled levels of accuracy, reliability, ease of use and cost savings.

The MIDS technology platform is protected by numerous patent applications now in the national phase in key geographic areas and already granted in China (grants in other territories expected to follow).

The MML technical team has world class expertise and technical know-how of the application of magnetism to medical testing. This knowledge, alongside their commercial experience of the POC market, puts MML in an excellent situation to develop and commercialise MIDS Cardiac . The Company believes that MML is well positioned to become a leading innovator in this field.  The MML development team has: 

Expertise in the field of quantitative micro-magnetic and luminescence measurement techniques and applying that specialism to measure density and behaviour of particulate markers within body fluids. 

Thirty years of experience in magnetic measurement and magnetic sensor (Hall Effect and Bio-Sensors) design and specifically in magnetic nano-particle applications within the medical and bio-engineering POC field. 

High level experience of dealing with the measurement of changes within body fluids and tissues in micro and nano environments. 

Extensive experience in the design and development of small, low cost POC measurement devices that read changes occurring on input strips, both from an engineering, physics (optics and magnetic), reader software and end user perspective. 

Clear understanding of quality standards, timescales, processes and testing rigours required in the POC healthcare area. 

Established relationships with commercial partners capable of creating licence revenue for enhancements of existing market products and to develop multiple new revenue streams from new applications.

7.      NON-CIRCUMVENTION . The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation, Bylaws or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Note, and will at all times in good faith carry out all of the provisions of this Note and take all action as may be required to protect the rights of the Holder of this Note. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, so long as this Note remains outstanding, the Company (a) shall not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon conversion of this Note above the Conversion Rate then in effect and (b) shall take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the conversion of this Note. 

8.      RESERVATION OF AUTHORIZED SHARES . 

(a)      Reservation . The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of this Note, no less than the maximum number of shares issuable on conversion of this Note (the   Required Reserve Amount  ). 

(b)      Insufficient Authorized Shares .  If, notwithstanding Section 8(a), and not in limitation thereof, at any time while this Note  remains outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock to satisfy its obligation to reserve a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an   Authorized Share Failure  ), then the Company shall promptly take all action reasonably necessary to increase the Company s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve the Required Reserve Amount for this Note. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure, but in no event later than seventy (70) days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of its stockholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting, the Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to solicit its stockholders  approval of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its Board of Directors to recommend to the stockholders that they approve such proposal.

ARTICLE I. CONVERSION RIGHTS 

1.1   

Conversion Right . The Junior Holder shall have the right from time to time, from the Issue Date and ending on the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined in Article II) pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Article II, each in respect of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this Junior Note to convert all or any part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Junior Note into fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) determined as provided herein (a  Conversion  provided, however, that in no event shall the Junior Holder be entitled to convert any portion of this Junior Note (A) at a time when the market price is less than $0.15 per share, as reported on the Principle Market (defined in Section 2.8), subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events, or (B)  in excess of that portion of this Junior Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Junior Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Junior Note or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Junior Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Junior Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso, provided, further, however, that the maximum percentage limitations on conversion may be waived by the Junior Holder upon, at the election of the Junior Holder, not less than 61 days  prior notice to the Borrower, and the provisions of the conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later date, as determined by the Junior Holder, as may be specified in such notice of waiver). The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Junior Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the  Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Borrower by the Junior Holder in accordance with Section 1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the  Conversion Date ). The term  Conversion Amount  means, with respect to any conversion of this Junior Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this Junior Note to be converted in such conversion plus (2) at the Junior Holder s option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Junior Note to the Conversion Date, plus (3) at the Junior Holder s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or (2) plus (4) at the Junior Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Junior Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof. 

1.2   

Conversion Price.  The conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) is set at $0.007 (subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events).  Other than as set forth in the foregoing sentence, the Conversion Price will not be otherwise reduced, for any reason, without the express written permission of the Senior Holder.  The Borrower undertakes to take all reasonable action to prevent the conversion of this Junior Note at a price less than the Conversion Price. 

4 

1.3   

Authorized Shares . The Borrower covenants that during the period the conversion right exists, the Borrower will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares (the  Reserved Amount ), free from pre-emptive rights, to provide for the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Junior Note. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Junior Note, the Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Junior Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Junior Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Junior Note. 

If, at any time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 2.2 of the Junior Note. 

1.4   

Method of Conversion.  

(a) Mechanics of Conversion. Subject to Section 1.1, this Junior Note may be converted by the Junior Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Junior Note at the principal office of the Borrower. 

(b) Surrender of Junior Note Upon Conversion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Junior Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Junior Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Junior Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Junior Note is so converted. The Junior Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Junior Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Junior Note upon each such conversion. In the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall,  prima facie,  be controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Junior Note is converted as aforesaid, the Junior Holder may not transfer this Junior Note unless the Junior Holder first physically surrenders this Junior Note to the Borrower, whereupon the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Junior Holder a new Junior Note of like tenor, registered as the Junior Holder (upon payment by the Junior Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal amount of this Junior Note. The Junior Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Junior Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Junior Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Junior Note represented by this Junior Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof. 

(c) Payment of Taxes. The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of this Junior Note in a name other than that of the Junior Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver any such shares or other securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Junior Holder or the custodian in whose street name such shares are to be held for the Junior Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been paid. 

5 

(d) Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion. Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Junior Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Junior Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within five (5) business days after such receipt (the  Deadline ) (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Junior Note) in accordance with the terms hereof. 

(e) Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock. Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Junior Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Junior Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect to the portion of this Junior Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Junior Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Junior Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Junior Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Junior Holder in connection with such conversion. The Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received by the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time, on such date.  

(f) Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer. In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ) Fast Automated Securities Transfer ( FAST ) program, upon request of the Junior Holder and its compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1.1 and in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Junior Holder by crediting the account of Junior Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system. 

(g) Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline. Without in any way limiting the Junior Holder s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Junior Note is not delivered by the Deadline (other than a failure due to the circumstances described in Section 1.3 above, which failure shall be governed by such Section) the Borrower shall pay to the Junior Holder $500 per day in cash, for each day beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Junior Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Junior Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Junior Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Junior Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Junior Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Junior Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 1.4(g) are justified. 

6 

1.5  Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Junior Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act (or a successor rule) ( Rule 144 ) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an  affiliate  (as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Exchange Agreement). Until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Junior Note have been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Junior Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement or that has not been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a legend substantially in the following form, as appropriate: 

NEITHER THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

1.6  Effect of Certain Events . 

(a) Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc. Subject to the subordination provisions, at the option of the Junior Holder, the sale, conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of unless such transaction directly relates to the raising of capital to fund development under the terms of the Development and Exclusive License Agreement ( License Agreement ), effective December 4, 2013 and as amended or amended in the future, or the consolidation, merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower is not the survivor shall either: (i) be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Article II) pursuant to which the Borrower shall be required to pay to the Junior Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined in Article II) or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof.  Person  shall mean any individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization. 

(b) Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc. If, at any time when this Junior Note is issued and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Junior Note, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete liquidation of the Borrower, then the Junior Holder of this Junior Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Junior Note, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Junior Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction had this Junior Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Junior Holder of this Junior Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Junior Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, thirty (30) days prior written notice (but in any event at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve, or if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Junior Holder shall be entitled to convert this Junior Note) and (b) the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Section 1.6(b). The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. 

(c) Adjustment Due to Distribution. If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the Borrower s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a  Distribution ), then the Junior Holder of this Junior Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record for determining shareholders entitled to such Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the Junior Holder with respect to the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Junior Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to such Distribution. 

8 

(d) Purchase Rights. Subject to the right of the Senior Holder to purchase all of the securities offered by the Borrower under the Purchase Rights in its Senior Note, as to all the securities into which the Senior Note and the Junior Note may be converted, if, at any time when any Notes are issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues any convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (the  Purchase Rights ) pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock, then if the Senior Holder has not purchased all its pro rata portion based on the Senior Note and Junior Note together, the Junior Holder of this Junior Note will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Junior Holder could have acquired if such Junior Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Junior Note (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights. 

(e) Notice of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price as a result of the events described in this Section 1.6, the Borrower, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment and prepare and furnish to the Junior Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Borrower shall, upon the written request at any time of the Junior Holder, furnish to such Junior Holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities or property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Junior Note. 

1.7 

Trading Market Limitations . Unless permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the principal securities market on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded, in no event shall the Borrower issue upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Junior Note more than the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that the Borrower can issue pursuant to any rule of the principal United States securities market on which the Common Stock is then traded (the  Maximum Share Amount ), which shall be 4.99% of the total shares outstanding on the Closing Date (as defined in the Exchange Agreement), subject to equitable adjustment from time to time for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, capital reorganizations and similar events relating to the Common Stock occurring after the date hereof. Once the Maximum Share Amount has been issued, if the Borrower fails to eliminate any prohibitions under applicable law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange, interdealer quotation system or other self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over the Borrower or any of its securities on the Borrower s ability to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Maximum Share Amount, in lieu of any further right to convert this Junior Note, this will be considered an Event of Default under Section 2.3 of the Junior Note. 

9 

1.8 

Status as Shareholder . Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by the Junior Holder, (i) the shares covered thereby (other than the shares, if any, which cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Junior Holder s allocated portion of the Reserved Amount or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii) the Junior Holder s rights as a Junior Holder of such converted portion of this Junior Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive certificates for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to such Junior Holder because of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this Junior Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Junior Holder has not received certificates for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the expiration of the Deadline with respect to a conversion of any portion of this Junior Note for any reason, then (unless the Junior Holder otherwise elects to retain its status as a holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Junior Holder shall regain the rights of a Junior Holder of this Junior Note with respect to such unconverted portions of this Junior Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted Junior Note to the Junior Holder or, if the Junior Note has not been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Junior Note has not been converted. In all cases, the Junior Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right to receive Conversion Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default and any subsequent Conversion Default and (ii) the right to have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined in accordance with Section 1.3) for the Borrower s failure to convert this Junior Note.

It is an obligation of the Borrower to remain current in its obligations to its transfer agent.

ARTICLE III. MISCELLANEOUS 

3.1  Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver .

3.3  Amendments . This Junior Note and any provision hereof may only be amended by an instrument in writing signed by the Borrower and the Junior Holder. The term  Junior Note  and all reference thereto, as used throughout this instrument, shall mean this instrument as originally executed, or if later amended or supplemented, then as so amended or supplemented. 

3.4  Assignability.  This Junior Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to be the benefit of the Junior Holder and its successors and assigns. Each transferee of this Junior Note must be an  accredited investor  (as defined in Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Act). Notwithstanding anything in this Junior Note to the contrary, this Junior Note may be pledged as collateral in connection with a bona fide margin account or other lending arrangement. 

3.5  Cost of Collection . If default is made in the payment of this Junior Note, the Borrower shall pay the Junior Holder hereof costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys  fees. 

3.6  Governing Law . This Junior Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the transactions contemplated by this Junior Note shall be brought only in the state courts of New York or in the federal courts located in the state and county of Nassau. The parties to this Junior Note hereby irrevocably waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not assert any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon  forum non conveniens .

3.7  Certain Amounts . Whenever pursuant to this Junior Note the Borrower is required to pay an amount in excess of the outstanding principal amount (or the portion thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and unpaid interest plus Default Interest on such interest, the Borrower and the Junior Holder agree that the actual damages to the Junior Holder from the receipt of cash payment on this Junior Note may be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower represents stipulated damages and not a penalty and is intended to compensate the Junior Holder in part for loss of the opportunity to convert this Junior Note and to earn a return from the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of this Junior Note at a price in excess of the price paid for such shares pursuant to this Junior Note. The Borrower and the Junior Holder hereby agree that such amount of stipulated damages is not plainly disproportionate to the possible loss to the Junior Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to convert this Junior Note into shares of Common Stock. 

3.9  Notice of Corporate Events . Except as otherwise provided below, the Junior Holder of this Junior Note shall have no rights as a Junior Holder of Common Stock unless and only to the extent that it converts this Junior Note into Common Stock.

In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of its shareholders for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, reclassification or recapitalization) any share of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to vote in connection with any proposed sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Borrower, the Borrower shall mail a notice to the Junior Holder, at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date specified therein (or thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of the transaction or event, whichever is earlier), of the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, right or other event, and a brief statement regarding the amount and character of such dividend, distribution, right or other event to the extent known at such time. The Borrower shall make a public announcement of any event requiring notification to the Junior Holder hereunder substantially simultaneously with the notification to the Junior Holder in accordance with the terms of this Section 3.9. 

3.10  Remedies . The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Junior Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Borrower acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Junior Note will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Junior Note, that the Junior Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies at law or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing any breach of this Junior Note and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.
