  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  Customer Demand 
    
  AEP s weather-normalized retail sales volumes for the third quarter of 2016 decreased by 0.5% from the third quarter of 2015.  AEP s third quarter 2016 industrial sales decreased 2.6% compared to the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to decreased sales to customers in the manufacturing sector.  Weather-normalized residential sales increased by 1.2% and commercial sales decreased by 0.5% in the third quarter of 2016, respectively, from the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  AEP s weather-normalized retail sales volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 0.4% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  AEP s industrial sales volumes for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased 1.9% compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to decreased sales to customers in the manufacturing sector.  Weather-normalized residential and commercial sales increased by 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  June 2015 - May 2018 ESP Including PPA Application and Proposed ESP Extension through 2024 
    
  In March 2016, a contested stipulation agreement related to the PPA rider application was modified and approved by the PUCO.  The approved PPA rider is effective April 2016 through May 2024, subject to audit and review by the PUCO.  The stipulation agreement, as approved, included (a) an Affiliate PPA between OPCo and AGR to be included in the PPA rider, (b) OPCo s OVEC PPA to be included in the PPA rider, (c) potential additional contingent customer credits of up to $100 million to be included in the PPA rider over the final four years of the PPA rider and (d) the limitation that OPCo will not flow through any capacity performance penalties or bonuses through the PPA rider.  Additionally, subject to cost recovery and PUCO approval, OPCo agreed to develop and implement, by 2021, a solar energy project(s) of at least 400 MW and a wind energy project(s) of at least 500 MW, with 100% of all output to be received by OPCo.  AEP affiliates could own up to 50% of these solar and wind projects.  OPCo agreed to file a carbon reduction plan with the PUCO by December 2016 that will focus on fuel diversification and carbon emission reductions.   
    
  In March 2016, a group of merchant generation owners filed a complaint at the FERC against PJM seeking revisions to the Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) in PJM s tariff.  Although the complaint requested the FERC act in advance of the May 2016 Base Residual Auction for the 2019/2020 delivery year, the complaint is still pending without a decision from the FERC.  If approved as proposed, the revised MOPR could affect future bidding behavior for units with cost recovery mechanisms.   
    
  In April 2016, the FERC issued an order granting a January 2016 complaint filed against AGR and OPCo.  The FERC order rescinded the waivers of the FERC s affiliate rules as to the affiliate PPA between AGR and OPCo.  As a result, AGR and OPCo cannot implement the affiliate PPA without the FERC review, in accordance with FERC s rules governing affiliate transactions.  As a result of the April 2016 FERC order, management does not intend to pursue the affiliate PPA. 
    
  In May 2016, OPCo filed an application for rehearing with the PUCO related to certain aspects of the March 2016 PUCO order.  The application included a proposed OVEC-only PPA Rider that included an option for the rider to be bypassable.  The proposed OVEC-only PPA Rider included (a) the elimination of the PUCO-imposed customer-specific rate impact cap of 5% through May 2018, (b) modifications to proportionately decrease the amount of the potential customer credits and (c) the inclusion of PJM capacity performance penalties within the PPA rider.  Also in May 2016, intervenors filed applications for rehearing with the PUCO opposing the modified and approved stipulation agreement. 
    
  OPCo has the option to exercise its right to withdraw from the PPA stipulation if the PUCO does not accept the requested modifications. 
  
   1 

Consistent with the terms of the modified and approved stipulation agreement, in May 2016, OPCo filed an amended ESP that proposed to extend the ESP through May 2024.  The amended ESP included (a) an extension of the PPA rider, which includes only OPCo s entitlements to its ownership percentage of OVEC, (b) a proposed 10.41% return on common equity on capital costs for certain riders, (c) the continuation of riders previously approved in the June 2015 - May 2018 ESP, (d) proposed increases in rate caps related to OPCo s Distribution Investment Rider and (e) the addition of various new riders, including a Generation Resource Rider.  Based upon a September 2016 PUCO order, OPCo will refile its ESP extension application and supporting testimony in November 2016. 
    
  If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect all components of its ESP rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See  Ohio Electric Security Plan Filings  section of Note   4  . 
    
  Ohio Electric Security Plan Filings 
    
  2009 - 2011 ESP 
    
  In 2012, the PUCO issued an order in a separate proceeding which implemented a PIRR to recover OPCo s deferred fuel costs in rates beginning September 2012.  The PUCO ruled that carrying charges should be calculated without an offset for accumulated deferred income taxes and that a long-term debt rate should be applied when collections begin.  In November 2012, OPCo appealed that PUCO order to the Supreme Court of Ohio claiming a long-term debt rate modified the previously adjudicated 2009 - 2011 ESP order, which granted a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate.  In 2015, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued a decision that reversed the PUCO order on the carrying cost rate issue and remanded the matter back to the PUCO for reinstatement of the WACC rate.  In June 2016, the PUCO approved OPCo s proposed increase to the PIRR rates, in accordance with the Supreme Court of Ohio ruling.  The increase to PIRR rates included $146 million in additional carrying charges and the recovery of $40 million in additional under-recovered fuel costs resulting from a decrease in customer demand.  The increase is effective July 2016 through December 2018.  In July 2016, intervenors filed requests for rehearing with the PUCO, which the PUCO granted in August 2016. 
    
  If the PUCO determines after rehearing that the additional PIRR carrying charges are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  June 2012 - May 2015 ESP Including Capacity Charge  
    
  In August 2012, the PUCO issued an order which adopted and modified a new ESP that established base generation rates through May 2015.  In 2013, this ruling was generally upheld in PUCO rehearing orders. 
    
  In July 2012, the PUCO issued an order in a separate capacity proceeding requiring OPCo to charge CRES providers the RPM price and authorized OPCo to defer a portion of its incurred capacity costs not recovered from CRES providers up to $188.88/MW day.  The OPCo RPM price collected from CRES providers, which included reserve margins, was approximately $34/MW day through May 2014 and $150/MW day from June 2014 through May 2015.  In April 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued two opinions related to the deferral of OPCo s capacity charges.  In one of the opinions, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that the PUCO must reconsider an energy credit that was used to determine OPCo s authorized capacity deferral threshold of $188.88/MW day during the August 2012 through May 2015 period.  The PUCO reduced OPCo s authorized capacity deferral threshold to $188.88/MW day largely due to an offset for an energy credit of $147.41/MW day.  The Supreme Court of Ohio directed the PUCO to substantively address OPCo s arguments that the $147.41/MW day credit was overstated by approximately $100/MW day due to various inaccuracies affecting input data and assumptions. 
    
  As part of the August 2012 ESP order, the PUCO established a non-bypassable RSR, effective September 2012.  The RSR was collected from customers at $3.50/MWh through May 2014 and at $4.00/MWh for the period June 2014 through May 2015, with $1.00/MWh applied to the recovery of deferred capacity costs.  In April 2015, the PUCO issued an order that modified and approved OPCo s July 2014 application to collect the unrecovered portion of the deferred capacity costs.  As of   September 30, 2016  , OPCo s net deferred capacity costs balance was $239 million,  
  
   2 

including debt carrying costs.  In April 2016, the second Supreme Court of Ohio opinion rejected a portion of OPCo s RSR revenues collected during the period September 2012 through May 2015 and directed the PUCO to reduce OPCo s deferred capacity costs by these previously collected RSR revenues.  The Supreme Court of Ohio was not able to determine the amount of the reduction to OPCo s deferred capacity costs and remanded the issue to the PUCO to determine the appropriate reduction.  As directed by the PUCO, in May 2016, OPCo submitted revised RSR tariffs that reflect the RSR being collected subject to refund. 
    
  In April 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio also ruled favorably on OPCo s cross-appeal regarding a previously PUCO-imposed SEET threshold under the ESP and remanded this issue to the PUCO.  See  Significantly Excessive Earnings Test Filings  section of Note   4  . 
    
  In 2013, the PUCO issued its Orders on Rehearing for the ESP which generally upheld its August 2012 order.  The PUCO clarified that a final reconciliation of revenues and expenses would be permitted for any over- or under-recovery on several riders including fuel.  In November 2013, the PUCO issued an order approving OPCo s competitive bid process with modifications.   Additionally, the PUCO ordered that intervenor concerns related to the recovery of the fixed fuel costs through potentially both the FAC and the approved capacity charges be addressed in subsequent FAC proceedings. 
    
  In January 2014, the PUCO denied all rehearing requests and agreed to issue a supplemental request for an independent auditor in the 2012 - 2013 FAC proceeding to separately examine the recovery of the fixed fuel costs, including OVEC.  In March 2014, the PUCO approved OPCo s request to implement riders related to the unbundling of the FAC.  In October 2014, the independent auditor, selected by the PUCO, filed its report with the PUCO for the period August 2012 through May 2015.  If the PUCO ultimately concludes that a portion of the fixed fuel costs are also recovered through OPCo s $188.88/MW day capacity charge, the independent auditor has recommended a methodology for calculating a refund of a portion of certain fixed fuel costs.  The retail share of these fixed fuel costs is approximately $90 million annually.  Management believes that no over-recovery of costs has occurred and disagrees with the findings in the audit report. 
    
  In June 2016, OPCo filed a request with the PUCO that requested a consolidated procedural schedule to resolve interrelated proceedings including (a) OPCo s deferral of capacity costs for the period August 2012 through May 2015, (b) the implementation of OPCo s RSR and (c) the concerns related to the recovery of fixed fuel costs through both the FAC and the approved capacity charges.  As part of the filing, OPCo requested that its net deferred capacity costs balance as of May 31, 2015 increase by $157 million, including carrying charges through September 2016.  This net increase consists of a $327 million decrease due to the non-deferral portion of the RSR collections and an increase of $484 million for the correction of the energy credit.  Recovery of the $157 million was requested to be effective October 2016 through December 2018.  Additionally, OPCo filed testimony supporting the position that double recovery of fixed fuel costs could not have occurred because OPCo was unable to fully recover its capacity costs, which included fixed fuel costs, even with a corrected energy credit. 
    
  Due to the interrelated nature of the two Supreme Court of Ohio opinions that directly relate to OPCo s deferred capacity costs, management believes that the PUCO will rule upon these issues together.  Further, management believes that the net impact of these issues will not result in a material future reduction of OPCo s net income.  The recovery of fixed fuel costs will be addressed in a separate hearing scheduled for January 2017.  See  2012 and 2013 Fuel Adjustment Clause Audits  section of Note   4  . 
    
  If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect all components of its ESP rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See  Ohio Electric Security Plan Filings  section of Note   4  .

Merchant Generation Assets 
    
  In September 2016, AEP signed an agreement to sell Darby, Gavin, Lawrenceburg and Waterford Plants ( Disposition Plants ) totaling 5,326 MWs of competitive generation for approximately $2.2 billion to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale is subject to regulatory approvals from the FERC, the IURC and federal clearance pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR).  In October 2016, the Federal Trade Commission granted the sale early termination of the HSR waiting period thereby satisfying the HSR conditions to close the transaction.  As of September 30, 2016, the net book value of these assets, including related materials and supplies inventory and CWIP, was $1.8 billion.  AEP expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion in cash after taxes, debt retirement and transaction fees.  AEP is evaluating options to invest these proceeds, including reinvestment in regulated businesses and renewable energy projects and additional debt retirement.  The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.  An after tax gain of approximately $150 million is expected from the sale subject to inventory true-ups, income tax and other adjustments.  
    
  The assets and liabilities included in the sale transaction have been recorded as Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Held for Sale, respectively, on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.  See  Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale  section of Note   6   for additional information.  
    
  In September 2016, due to AEP s ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives for its merchant generation assets, declining forecasts of future energy and capacity prices, and a decreasing likelihood of cost recovery through regulatory proceedings or legislation in the state of Ohio providing for the recovery of AEP s existing Ohio merchant generation assets, AEP performed an impairment analysis at the unit level on the remaining merchant generation assets in accordance with accounting guidance for impairments of long-lived assets.  The evaluation was performed using generating unit specific estimated future cash flows and resulted in a material impairment of certain merchant generation fleet assets.  As a result, AEP recorded a pretax impairment of $2.3 billion ($1.5 billion, net of tax) in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statement of operations related to 2,684 MWs of Ohio merchant generation including Cardinal Unit 1, 43.5% ownership interest in Conesville Unit 4, Conesville Units 5-6, 26.0% ownership interest in Stuart Units 1-4, and 25.4% ownership interest in Zimmer Unit 1, as well as Putnam coal and I M s Price River coal reserves, Desert Sky and Trent Wind Farms and the merchant generation portion of the Oklaunion Plant.  As of September 30, 2016, the remaining net book value of these assets is $50 million.  See  Merchant Generating Assets (Generation   Marketing Segment)  section of Note   6   for additional information.  
    
  Management continues to evaluate potential alternatives for the remaining merchant generation assets.  These potential alternatives may include, but are not limited to, propose restructuring of Ohio electricity regulations to allow certain of these assets to be acquired by OPCo for the benefit of its customers, transfer or sale of AEP s ownership interests, or a wind down of merchant coal-fired generation fleet operations.  AEP is also continuing a separate strategic review and evaluating alternatives related to the 48 MW Racine Hydroelectric Plant.  Management has not set a specific time frame for a decision on these assets.   These alternatives could result in additional losses which could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  Renewable Generation Portfolio 
    
  The growth of AEP s renewable generation portfolio reflects the company s strategy to diversify generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both their energy and capacity needs.    
    
  AEP has formed two new subsidiaries within the Generation   Marketing segment to further develop its renewable portfolio.  AEP OnSite Partners, LLC works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions based upon market knowledge, technology innovations and deal structuring which may include distributed solar, wind, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other forms of cost reducing energy technologies.  AEP OnSite Partners, LLC pursues projects where a suitable termed agreement is entered into with a credit-worthy counterparty.  AEP Renewables, LLC develops and/or acquires large scale renewable generation projects that are backed with long-term contracts with credit-worthy counterparties.  These subsidiaries have approximately 4 MW of renewable generation projects in operation and 56 MW of renewable generation projects under construction with an estimated financial commitment of approximately $119 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , $49 million of costs have been incurred related to these projects.

Merchant Portion of Turk Plant 
    
  SWEPCo constructed the Turk Plant, a base load 600 MW pulverized coal ultra-supercritical generating unit in Arkansas, which was placed into service in December 2012 and is included in the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment.  SWEPCo owns 73% (440 MW) of the Turk Plant and operates the facility. 
    
  The APSC granted approval for SWEPCo to build the Turk Plant by issuing a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need (CECPN) for the SWEPCo Arkansas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant (approximately 20%).  Following an appeal by certain intervenors, the Arkansas Supreme Court issued a decision that reversed the APSC s grant of the CECPN.  In June 2010, in response to an Arkansas Supreme Court decision, the APSC issued an order which reversed and set aside the previously granted CECPN.  This share of the Turk Plant output is currently not subject to cost-based rate recovery and is being sold into the wholesale market.  Approximately 80% of the Turk Plant investment is recovered under cost-based rate recovery in Texas, Louisiana, and through SWEPCo s wholesale customers under FERC-based rates.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the net book value of Turk Plant was $1.5 billion, before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP.  
    
  If SWEPCo cannot ultimately recover its investment and expenses related to the Turk Plant, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  2012 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In 2012, SWEPCo initiated a proceeding to establish new formula base rates in Louisiana, including recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant.  In February 2013, a settlement was approved by the LPSC that increased SWEPCo s Louisiana total rates by approximately $2 million annually, effective March 2013.  The March 2013 base rates are based upon a 10% return on common equity and cost recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant and Stall Unit, subject to refund.  The settlement also provided that the LPSC would review base rates in 2014 and 2015 and that SWEPCo would recover non-fuel Turk Plant costs and a full weighted-average cost of capital return on the prudently incurred Turk Plant investment in jurisdictional rate base, effective January 2013.  In December 2014, the LPSC approved a settlement agreement related to the staff review of the cost of service.  The settlement agreement reduced the requested revenue increase by $3 million, primarily due to the timing of both the allowed recovery of certain existing regulatory assets and the establishment of a regulatory asset for certain previously expensed costs.  A hearing at the LPSC related to the Turk Plant prudence review is scheduled for March 2017.  If the LPSC orders refunds based upon the pending prudence review of the Turk Plant investment, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See the  2012 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing  section of Note   4  .  
    
  Welsh Plant - Environmental Impact 
    
  Management currently estimates that the investment necessary to meet proposed environmental regulations through 2025 for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 could cost approximately $850 million  ,   excluding AFUDC.  As of   September 30, 2016  , SWEPCo had incurred costs of $395 million, including AFUDC, and had remaining contractual construction obligations of $14 million related to these projects.  As part of this investment, in 2016 SWEPCo completed construction of environmental control projects to meet Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 at a cost of approximately $370 million, excluding AFUDC.  Management continues to evaluate the impact of environmental rules and related project cost estimates.  In March 2016, SWEPCo filed a request with the APSC to recover $69 million in environmental costs related to the Arkansas retail jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, which was approved by the APSC in August 2016.  SWEPCo began recovering the Arkansas jurisdictional share of these costs in March 2016, subject to review in the next filed base rate proceeding.  In September 2016, SWEPCo filed an additional request to increase the Arkansas retail jurisdictional share of the environmental investment by $10 million, for a total of $79 million.  SWEPCo implemented the increase in September 2016.  SWEPCo will seek recovery of the remaining project costs from customers at the state commissions and the FERC.  See  Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) Regulation  and  Climate Change, CO   2    Regulation and Energy Policy  sections of  Environmental Issues  below.  

5 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the net book value of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 was $632 million, before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP.  In April 2016, Welsh Plant, Unit 2 was retired.  Upon retirement, $76 million was reclassified as Regulatory Assets on the balance sheet related to the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and the related asset retirement obligation costs.  Management will seek recovery of the remaining regulatory assets in future rate proceedings. 
    
  If any of these costs are not recoverable, including retirement-related costs for Welsh Plant, Unit 2, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  2015 Oklahoma Base Rate Case 
    
  In July 2015, PSO filed a request with the OCC to increase annual revenues by $137 million to recover costs associated with its environmental compliance plan for the Federal EPA s Regional Haze Rule and Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, and to recover investments and other costs that have increased since the last base rate case.  The annual increase consists of (a) a base rate increase of $89 million, which includes $48 million in increased depreciation expense that reflects, among other things, recovery through June 2026 of Northeastern Plant, Units 3 and 4, (b) a rider or base rate increase of $44 million to recover costs for the environmental controls being installed on Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 and the Comanche Plant and (c) a request to include environmental consumable costs in the FAC, estimated to be $4 million annually.  The rate increase includes a proposed return on common equity of 10.5% effective in January 2016.  The proposed $44 million increase related to environmental investments was effective in March 2016, after the Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 environmental controls were placed in service.  The total estimated cost of the environmental controls to be installed at Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 and the Comanche Plant is $219 million, excluding AFUDC.  As of   September 30, 2016  , PSO had incurred costs of $180 million and $43 million, including AFUDC, for Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 and Comanche Plant, respectively. 
    
  In addition, the filing also notified the OCC that the incremental replacement capacity and energy costs, including the first year effects of new PPAs, estimated to be $35 million, will be incurred related to the environmental compliance plan due to the closure of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, which would be recovered through the FAC.  In April 2016, Northeastern Plant, Unit 4 was retired.  Upon retirement, $87 million was reclassified as Regulatory Assets on the balance sheet related to the net book value of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4.  These regulatory assets are pending regulatory approval. 
    
  In June 2016, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a report related to PSO s base rate case filing and subsequently provided an additional supplemental report in August 2016.  The ALJ recommended a 9.25% return on common equity.  The ALJ found that PSO s environmental compliance plan is prudent and provided for cost recovery of the investment in this case with a recommended investment cap of $210 million on environmental controls installed at Northeastern Plant, Unit 3.   Additionally, the ALJ recommendations included (a) a $14 million increase in depreciation expense, (b)  continued depreciation of Northeastern Plant, Units 3 and 4 through 2040 (no accelerated depreciation), (c) return of, but no return on, the remaining net book value of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, (d) elimination of the rider to recover advanced metering starting in December 2016, without inclusion in base rates and (e) elimination of the system reliability rider through consolidation in base rates, without addressing a transition for recovery of rider costs, including deferred costs.  The estimated annual revenue increase resulting from the ALJ recommendations is approximately $47 million.   
    
  In June and September 2016, PSO, the OCC staff, the Attorney General and intervenors filed exceptions to the ALJ reports.  The OCC staff filed exceptions that supported the full recovery of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, including a return, and recommended a $32 million increase in annual revenues.  An order from the OCC is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
    
  If any of these costs, including a return on Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  See the  2015 Oklahoma Base Rate Case  section of Note   4  .

Indiana Amended PJM Settlement Agreement 
    
  In September 2016, I M and certain intervenors filed an amended settlement agreement with the IURC.  This agreement amends a previously approved 2014 settlement agreement that addresses the recovery of 43.5% of certain transmission expenses through the Indiana PJM rider through 2017. 
    
  The amended agreement allows I M to recover 100% of the Indiana jurisdictional share of these transmission expenses not recovered through base rates through the Indiana PJM rider, subject to a $109 million cap for the period January 2017 through June 2018.  Beginning July 2018, I M will be allowed to recover 100% of the Indiana jurisdictional share of these transmission expenses through the Indiana PJM rider, without a cap, until the issue is addressed by the IURC in a future proceeding, subject to the condition that I M files a base rate case on or before January 2018.  The amended agreement also provides for deferral of incremental vegetation management expenses over the period January 2017 through June 2018.  Any vegetation management expenses deferred would reduce the cap for the transmission expenses described above.  As part of the amended settlement, I M agreed that it will not file a base rate case before July 2017 and will not implement new base rates prior to July 2018.  A hearing at the IURC was held in October 2016.  
    
  Rockport Plant, Unit 2 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) 
    
  In October 2016, I M filed an application with the IURC for approval of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to install SCR technology at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 by December 2019.  The equipment will allow I M to reduce emissions of NO   x    from Rockport Plant, Unit 2 in order for I M to continue to operate that unit under current environmental requirements. The estimated cost of the SCR project is $274 million, excluding AFUDC, to be shared equally between I M and AEGCo.  The filing included a request for authorization for I M to defer its Indiana jurisdictional ownership share of costs including investment carrying costs, depreciation over a 10-year life and other related expenses.  I M proposed recovery of these costs using the existing Clean Coal Technology Rider. The AEGCo ownership share of the proposed SCR project will be billable under the Rockport Unit Power Agreement to affiliates, including I M, with I M s share recoverable in its base rates.  
  TCC and TNC Merger 
    
  In June 2016, TCC and TNC filed applications with the PUCT and FERC that requested approval to merge TCC and TNC into AEP Utilities, Inc.  Upon merger, AEP Utilities, Inc. will change its name to AEP Texas Inc.  The proposed merger would be effective December 31, 2016.  The applications proposed no changes to current TCC and TNC rates.  A hearing at the PUCT was held in August 2016.  In September 2016, the FERC issued an order approving the merger application.  In October 2016, the ALJ issued a proposal for decision that recommends approval of the merger provided certain post-merger conditions are imposed.  The conditions recommended by the ALJ include a) the sharing of certain interest rate savings with customers and b) an annual credit to customers of approximately $630 thousand for savings resulting from an expected reduction in post-merger debt issuance costs, effective until the next base rate case.  Management is evaluating the conditions recommended by the ALJ.  A decision from the PUCT is expected in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  FERC Transmission Complaint 
    
  In October 2016, several parties filed a joint complaint with the FERC that states the base return on common equity used by various AEP affiliates in calculating formula transmission rates under the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) is excessive and should be reduced from 10.99% to 8.32%, effective upon the date of the complaint.  Management is reviewing the filing and evaluating a response to the complaint.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses, if any, that is reasonably possible of occurring.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds from the date of filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

Kingsport Base Rate Case 
    
  In January 2016, KGPCo filed a request with the TRA to increase base rates by $12 million annually based upon a proposed return on common equity of 10.66%.  In August 2016, the TRA approved a settlement agreement that included an $8 million annual increase in base rates with a 9.85% return on common equity effective September 2016.  
    
  Virginia Legislation Affecting Biennial Reviews 
    
  In February 2015, amendments to Virginia law governing the regulation of investor-owned electric utilities were enacted.  Under the amended Virginia law, APCo s existing generation and distribution base rates are frozen until after the Virginia SCC rules on APCo s next biennial review, which APCo will file in March 2020 for the 2018 and 2019 test years.  These amendments also preclude the Virginia SCC from performing biennial reviews of APCo s earnings for the years 2014 through 2017.  APCo s financial statements adequately address the impact of these amendments.  The amendments provide that APCo will absorb its Virginia jurisdictional share of incremental generation and distribution costs incurred during 2014 through 2017 that are associated with severe weather events and/or natural disasters and costs associated with potential asset impairments related to new carbon emission guidelines issued by the Federal EPA. 
    
  In February 2016, certain APCo industrial customers filed a petition with the Virginia SCC requesting the issuance of a declaratory order that finds the amendments to Virginia law suspending biennial reviews unconstitutional and, accordingly, directs APCo to make biennial review filings beginning in 2016.  In July 2016, the Virginia SCC issued an order that denied the petition.  In July 2016, intervenors, including certain APCo industrial customers, filed an appeal of the order with the Supreme Court of Virginia.  Management is unable to predict the outcome of these challenges to the Virginia legislation.  If the biennial review process is reinstated in advance of March 2020, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  PJM Capacity Market 
    
  AGR is required to offer all of its available generation capacity in the PJM Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) auction, which is conducted three years in advance of the delivery year. 
    
  In June 2015, FERC approved PJM s proposal to create a new Capacity Performance (CP) product, intended to improve generator performance and reliability during emergency events by allowing higher offers into the RPM auction and imposing greater charges for non-performance during emergency events.  PJM procured approximately 80% CP and 20% Base Capacity for the June 2018 through May 2019 and June 2019 through May 2020 periods, while transitioning to 100% CP with the June 2020 through May 2021 period.  FERC also approved transition incremental auctions to procure CP for the June 2016 through May 2017 and June 2017 through May 2018 periods. 
    
  In the third quarter of 2015, PJM conducted the two transition auctions.  The transition auctions allowed generators, including AGR, to re-offer cleared capacity that qualifies as CP.  Shown below are the results of the two transition auctions: 

AGR cleared 7,169MW at $134/MW-day for the June 2016 through May 2017 period, replacing the original auction clearing price of $59.37/MW-day.  AGR cleared 6,495MW for the June 2017 through May 2018 period at $151.50/MW-day, replacing the original auction clearing price of $120/MW-day.   

8 

In August 2015, PJM held its first base residual auction implementing CP rules for the June 2018 through May 2019 period.  AGR cleared 7,209 MW at the CP auction price of $164.77/MW-day.  The base residual auction for the June 2019 through May 2020 period was conducted in May 2016.  AGR cleared 7,301 MW at the CP auction price of $100/MW-day.  Shown below are the results for the June 2018 through May 2019 and June 2019 through May 2020 periods: 

Once the pending sale of the Darby, Gavin, Lawrenceburg and Waterford Plants is closed, AGR will not be responsible for or receive capacity revenue for the portion of the cleared capacity associated with these plants. 
    
  The FERC order exempted Fixed Resource Requirement (FRR) entities, including APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo, from the CP rules through the delivery period ending May 2019.  Beginning in June 2019, FRR entities are subject to CP rules. 

LITIGATION 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, AEP is involved in employment, commercial, environmental and regulatory litigation.  Since it is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, management cannot predict the eventual resolution, timing or amount of any loss, fine or penalty.  Management assesses the probability of loss for each contingency and accrues a liability for cases that have a probable likelihood of loss if the loss can be estimated.  For details on the regulatory proceedings and pending litigation see Note 4 - Rate Matters, Note 6 - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies and the  Litigation  section of  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the   2015   Annual Report.  Additionally, see Note   4   - Rate Matters and Note   5   - Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies included herein.  Adverse results in these proceedings have the potential to reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Rockport Plant Litigation 
    
  In July 2013, the Wilmington Trust Company filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AEGCo and I M alleging that it will be unlawfully burdened by the terms of the modified NSR consent decree after the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease expiration in December 2022.  The terms of the consent decree allow the installation of environmental emission control equipment, repowering or retirement of the unit.  The plaintiff further alleges that the defendants  actions constitute breach of the lease and participation agreement.  The plaintiff seeks a judgment declaring that the defendants breached the lease, must satisfy obligations related to installation of emission control equipment and indemnify the plaintiff.  The New York court granted a motion to transfer this case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  In October 2013, a motion to dismiss the case was filed on behalf of AEGCo and I M.  In January 2015, the court issued an opinion and order granting the motion in part and denying the motion in part.  The court dismissed certain of the plaintiff s claims.  Several claims remained, including the claim for breach of the participation agreement and a claim alleging breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  In June 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion for partial judgment on the claims seeking dismissal of the breach of participation agreement claim as well as any claim for indemnification of costs associated with this case.  The plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint to add another claim under the lease and also filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  In November 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion to strike the plaintiff s motion for partial judgment and filed a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim.  In March 2016, the court entered an opinion and order in favor of AEGCo and I M, dismissing certain of the plaintiffs  claims for breach of contract and dismissing claims for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and further dismissing plaintiffs  claim for indemnification of costs.  By the same order, the court permitted plaintiffs to move forward with their claim that AEGCo and I M failed to exercise prudent utility practices in the maintenance and operation of Rockport Plant, Unit 2.  In April 2016, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of all remaining claims with prejudice and the court subsequently entered a final judgment.  In May 2016, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on whether AEGCo and  
  
   9 

I M are in breach of certain contract provisions that Plaintiffs allege operate to protect the Plaintiffs  residual interests in the unit and whether the trial court erred in dismissing Plaintiffs  claims that AEGCo and I M breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  This matter is currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring. 
    
  ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES 
    
  AEP is implementing a substantial capital investment program and incurring additional operational costs to comply with environmental control requirements.  Additional investments and operational changes will need to be made in response to existing and anticipated requirements such as CAA requirements to reduce emissions of SO   2   , NO   x   , PM, CO   2    and hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) from fossil fuel-fired power plants, rules governing the beneficial use and disposal of coal combustion products, clean water rules and renewal permits for certain water discharges. 
    
  AEP is engaged in litigation about environmental issues, was notified of potential responsibility for the clean-up of contaminated sites and incurred costs for disposal of SNF and future decommissioning of the nuclear units.  AEP, along with various industry groups, affected states and other parties challenged some of the Federal EPA requirements in court.  Management is also engaged in the development of possible future requirements including the items discussed below and state plans to reduce CO   2    emissions to address concerns about global climate change.  Management believes that further analysis and better coordination of these environmental requirements would facilitate planning and lower overall compliance costs while achieving the same environmental goals. 
    
  See a complete discussion of these matters in the  Environmental Issues  section of  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the   2015   Annual Report.  AEP will seek recovery of expenditures for pollution control technologies and associated costs from customers through rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Environmental rules could result in accelerated depreciation, impairment of assets or regulatory disallowances.  If AEP is unable to recover the costs of environmental compliance, it would reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Environmental Controls Impact on the Generating Fleet 
    
  The rules and proposed environmental controls discussed in the next several sections will have a material impact on the generating units in the AEP System.  Management continues to evaluate the impact of these rules, project scope and technology available to achieve compliance.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the AEP System had a total generating capacity of approximately 31,000 MWs, of which approximately 16,000 MWs are coal-fired.  Management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with these rules and other impacts of the environmental proposals on the fossil generating facilities.  Based upon management estimates, AEP s investment to meet these proposed requirements ranges from approximately $2.8 billion to $3.4 billion through 2025.  Management continues to evaluate the impact of the merchant fleet operations on this range.  The estimates include investments to convert some of the coal generation to natural gas.   
    
  The cost estimates will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in the final rules.  The cost estimates will also change based on: (a) the states  implementation of these regulatory programs, including the potential for state implementation plans (SIPs) or federal implementation plans (FIPs) that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired and replaced, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and (g) other factors.  In addition, management is continuing to evaluate the economic feasibility of environmental investments on both regulated and competitive plants.

In May 2015, the following plants or units of plants were retired: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the net book value of the AGR units listed above was zero.  The net book value before cost of removal, including related materials and supplies inventory and CWIP balances, of the regulated plants in the table above was approved for recovery, except for $144 million which management plans to seek regulatory approval. 
    
  In April 2016, AEP retired the following units of plants:  

As of   September 30, 2016  , the net book value before cost of removal, including related materials and supplies inventory and CWIP balances, of the PSO and SWEPCo units listed above was $161 million.  For Northeastern Station, Unit 4, PSO is seeking regulatory recovery of remaining net book values.  For Welsh Plant, Unit 2, SWEPCo will seek regulatory recovery of remaining net book values.   
    
  In October 2015, KPCo obtained permits following the KPSC s approval to convert its 278 MW Big Sandy Plant, Unit 1 to natural gas.  Big Sandy Plant, Unit 1 began operations as a natural gas unit in May 2016.  
    
  APCo obtained permits following the Virginia SCC s and WVPSC s approval to convert its 470 MW Clinch River Plant, Units 1 and 2 to natural gas.  In the third and fourth quarters of 2015, APCo retired the coal-related assets of Clinch River Plant, Units 1 and 2.  Of the retired coal related assets for Clinch River Plant, Units 1 and 2, management plans to seek regulatory approval for $24 million.  Clinch River Plant, Unit 1 and Unit 2 began operations as natural gas units in February 2016 and April 2016, respectively.  
    
  To the extent existing generation assets and the cost of new equipment and converted facilities are not recoverable, it could materially reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Clean Air Act Requirements 
    
  The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation s air quality and control sources of air emissions.  The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements.   

11 

The Federal EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) in 2005 requiring specific reductions in SO   2    and NO   x    emissions from power plants.  The Federal EPA issued the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) in August 2011 to replace CAIR.  The CSAPR was challenged in the courts.  In 2012, a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued a decision vacating and remanding CSAPR to the Federal EPA with instructions to continue implementing CAIR until a replacement rule is finalized.  That decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which reversed the decision and remanded the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ordered CSAPR to take effect on January 1, 2015 while the remand proceeding was still pending.  In July 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the rule to the Federal EPA.  In September 2016, the Federal EPA finalized its response to the remand for ozone season NO   x    budgets.  All of the states in which AEP s power plants are located are covered by CSAPR.  See  Cross-State Air Pollution Rule  section below. 
    
  The Federal EPA issued the final maximum achievable control technology (MACT) standards for coal and oil-fired power plants in 2012, but the rule was remanded to the Federal EPA upon further review.  The Federal EPA issued a supplemental finding, received comments and affirmed its decision on the MACT standards for power plants.  That decision has been challenged in the courts but the rule remains in effect.  See  Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) Regulation  section below.  
    
  The Federal EPA issued a Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), detailing how the CAA s requirement that certain facilities install best available retrofit technology (BART) will address regional haze in federal parks and other protected areas.  BART requirements apply to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants.  CAVR will be implemented through SIPs or, if SIPs are not adequate or are not developed on schedule, through FIPs.  The Federal EPA proposed disapproval of SIPs in a few states, including Arkansas.  In March 2012, the Federal EPA disapproved certain portions of the Arkansas regional haze SIP.  In April 2015, the Federal EPA published a proposed FIP to replace the disapproved portions, including revised BART determinations for the Flint Creek Plant that were consistent with the environmental controls currently under construction.  In September 2016, the Federal EPA published a final FIP that retains its BART determinations, but accelerates the schedule for implementation of certain required controls.  In June 2012, the Federal EPA published revisions to the regional haze rules to allow states participating in the CSAPR trading programs to use those programs in place of source-specific BART for SO   2    and NO   x    emissions based on its determination that CSAPR results in greater visibility improvements than source-specific BART in the CSAPR states.  This rule is being challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  Management supports compliance with CSAPR programs as satisfaction of the BART requirements.  The Federal EPA also proposed revisions to the requirements for submission of visibility SIPs by the states for future planning periods.  
    
  The Federal EPA issued rules for CO   2    emissions that apply to new and existing electric utility units.  See  Climate Change, CO   2    Regulation and Energy Policy  section below. 
    
  The Federal EPA also issued new, more stringent national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for PM, SO   2    and ozone.  In October 2015, the Federal EPA announced a lower final NAAQS for ozone of 70 parts per billion.  States are in the process of evaluating the attainment status and need for additional control measures in order to attain and maintain the new NAAQS and may develop additional requirements for facilities as a result of those evaluations.  Management cannot currently predict the nature, stringency or timing of those requirements. 
    
  Notable developments in significant CAA regulatory requirements affecting AEP s operations are discussed in the following sections. 
    
  Cross-State Air Pollution Rule  
    
  In 2011, the Federal EPA issued CSAPR.  Certain revisions to the rule were finalized in 2012.  CSAPR relies on newly-created SO   2    and NO   x    allowances and individual state budgets to compel further emission reductions from electric utility generating units in 28 states.  Interstate trading of allowances is allowed on a restricted sub-regional basis.  Arkansas and Louisiana are subject only to the seasonal NO   x    program in the rule.  Texas is subject to the annual programs for SO   2    and NO   x    in addition to the seasonal NO   x    program.  The annual SO   2    allowance budgets in Indiana, Ohio and West Virginia were reduced significantly in the rule.  A supplemental rule includes Oklahoma in the seasonal  
  
   12 

NO   x    program.  The supplemental rule was finalized in December 2011 with an increased NO   x    emission budget for the 2012 compliance year.  The Federal EPA issued a final Error Corrections Rule and further CSAPR revisions in 2012 to make corrections to state budgets and unit allocations and to remove the restrictions on interstate trading in the first phase of CSAPR. 
    
  Numerous affected entities, states and other parties filed petitions to review the CSAPR in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  In 2012, the court issued a decision vacating and remanding CSAPR to the Federal EPA with instructions to continue implementing CAIR until a replacement rule is finalized.  The majority determined that the CAA does not allow the Federal EPA to  overcontrol  emissions in an upwind state and that the Federal EPA exceeded its statutory authority by failing to allow states an opportunity to develop their own implementation plans before issuing a FIP.  A petition for review filed by the Federal EPA and other parties in the U.S. Supreme Court was granted in June 2013.  In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision reversing in part the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and remanding the case for further proceedings consistent with the opinion.  The Federal EPA filed a motion to lift the stay and allow Phase I of CSAPR to take effect on January 1, 2015 and Phase II to take effect on January 1, 2017.  The court granted the Federal EPA s motion.  The parties filed briefs and presented oral arguments.  In July 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found that the Federal EPA over-controlled the SO   2    and/or NO   x    budgets of 14 states.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the rule to the Federal EPA to timely revise the rule consistent with the court s opinion while CSAPR remains in place.  
    
  In December 2015, the Federal EPA issued a proposal to revise the ozone season NO   x    budgets in 23 states beginning in 2017 to address transport issues associated with the 2008 ozone standard and the budget errors identified in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit s July 2015 decision.  The proposal was open for public comment through February 1, 2016.  A final rule has been signed that addressed some of the concerns raised in comments, but will significantly reduce ozone season budgets in many states and discounts the value of banked CSAPR ozone season allowances.  Management believes that there are flaws in the underlying analysis of and justification for this rule.  Management is evaluating compliance options for the 2017 ozone season, including any opportunity to further optimize NO   x    emissions and availability of allowances. 
    
  Mercury and Other Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) Regulation 
    
  In 2012, the Federal EPA issued a rule addressing a broad range of HAPs from coal and oil-fired power plants.  The rule establishes unit-specific emission rates for units burning coal on a 30-day rolling average basis for mercury, PM (as a surrogate for particles of nonmercury metals) and hydrogen chloride (as a surrogate for acid gases).  In addition, the rule proposes work practice standards, such as boiler tune-ups, for controlling emissions of organic HAPs and dioxin/furans.  The effective date of the final rule was April 16, 2012 and compliance was required within three years.  Management obtained a one-year administrative extension at several units to facilitate the installation of controls or to avoid a serious reliability problem.  In addition, the Federal EPA issued an enforcement policy describing the circumstances under which an administrative consent order might be issued to provide a fifth year for the installation of controls or completion of reliability upgrades.  
    
  In April 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied all of the petitions for review of the April 2012 final rule.  Industry trade groups and several states filed petitions for further review in the U.S. Supreme Court and the court granted those petitions in November 2014.  
    
  In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit remanded the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule for further proceedings consistent with the U.S. Supreme Court s decision that the Federal EPA was unreasonable in refusing to consider costs in its determination whether to regulate emissions of HAPs from power plants.  The Federal EPA issued notice of a supplemental finding concluding that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate HAP emissions from coal-fired and oil-fired units.  Management submitted comments on the proposal.  In April 2016, the Federal EPA affirmed its determination that regulation of HAPs from electric generating units is necessary and appropriate.  Petitions for review of the Federal EPA s April 2016 determination have been filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  The rule remains in effect.

Climate Change, CO   2    Regulation and Energy Policy 
    
  The majority of the states where AEP has generating facilities passed legislation establishing renewable energy, alternative energy and/or energy efficiency requirements that can assist in reducing carbon emissions.  Management is taking steps to comply with these requirements, including increasing wind power purchases and broadening the AEP System s portfolio of energy efficiency programs.   
    
  In October 2015, the Federal EPA published the final standards for new, modified and reconstructed fossil fired steam generating units and combustion turbines, and final guidelines for the development of state plans to regulate CO   2    emissions from existing sources.  The final standard for new combustion turbines is 1,000 pounds of CO   2    per MWh and the final standard for new fossil steam units is 1,400 pounds of CO   2    per MWh.  Reconstructed turbines are subject to the same standard as new units and no standard for modified combustion turbines was issued.  Reconstructed fossil steam units are subject to a standard of 1,800 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for larger units and 2,000 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for smaller units.  Modified fossil steam units will be subject to a site specific standard no lower than the standards that would be applied if the units were reconstructed.  
    
  The final emissions guidelines for existing sources, known as the Clean Power Plan (CPP), are based on a series of declining emission rates that are implemented beginning in 2022 through 2029.  The final emission rate is 771 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for existing natural gas combined cycle units and 1,305 pounds of CO   2    per MWh for existing fossil steam units in 2030 and thereafter.  The Federal EPA also developed a set of rate-based and mass-based state goals. 
    
  The Federal EPA also published proposed  model  rules that can be adopted by the states that would allow sources within  trading ready  state programs to trade, bank or sell allowances or credits issued by the states.  These rules would also be the basis for any federal plan issued by the Federal EPA in a state that fails to submit or receive approval for a state plan.  The Federal EPA intends to finalize either a rate-based or mass-based trading program that can be enforced in states that fail to submit approved plans by the deadlines established in the final guidelines.  The Federal EPA established a 90-day public comment period on the proposed rules and management submitted comments.  In June 2016, the Federal EPA issued a separate proposal for the Clean Energy Incentive Program (CEIP) that was included in the model rules.  The Federal EPA will accept comments on the proposed rules through November 1, 2016.  Through the CEIP, states could issue allowances or credits for eligible actions prior to the first compliance period under the CPP.  Management is evaluating the potential impacts of the final CPP and the proposed CEIP, as well as the anticipated actions by states where assets are located.  The final rules are being challenged in the courts.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final Clean Power Plan, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans.  The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review.  
    
  Federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of CO   2    could result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs, which in turn, could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs.  Excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force AEP to close some coal-fired facilities and could lead to possible impairment of assets. 
    
  Coal Combustion Residual Rule 
    
  In April 2015, the Federal EPA published a final rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals (CCR), including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units and also FGD gypsum generated at some coal-fired plants.   
    
  The final rule became effective in October 2015.  The Federal EPA regulates CCR as a non-hazardous solid waste by its issuance of new minimum federal solid waste management standards.  The rule applies to new and existing active CCR landfills and CCR surface impoundments at operating electric utility or independent power production facilities.  The rule imposes new and additional construction and operating obligations, including location restrictions, liner criteria, structural integrity requirements for impoundments, operating criteria and additional groundwater monitoring requirements.  The rule does not apply to inactive CCR landfills, surface impoundments at retired generating stations

or the beneficial use of CCR.  The rule is self-implementing so state action is not required.  Because of this self-implementing feature, the rule contains extensive record keeping, notice and internet posting requirements.  The CCR rule requirements contain a compliance schedule spanning an approximate four year implementation period.  If CCR units do not meet these standards within the timeframes provided, they will be required to close.  Extensions of time for closure are available provided there is no alternative disposal capacity or the owner can certify cessation of a boiler by a certain date.  Challenges to the rule by industry associations of which AEP is a member are proceeding.   In April 2016, the parties entered into a settlement agreement that would require the Federal EPA to reconsider certain aspects of the rule.  In June 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order granting the voluntary remand of certain provisions including the Federal EPA s issuance of a rule vacating the provision creating specific closure requirements for inactive surface impoundments that complete closure by April 17, 2018.  In August 2016, the Federal EPA proposed a direct final rule to extend the deadlines for these facilities to comply with the CCR standards.  The proposed rule received no adverse comments and became effective 60 days following publication.  Management does not believe the direct final rule will have a significant impact on its planned pond closures.  The Federal EPA will also use its best efforts to complete reconsideration of all of the affected provisions within three years. 
    
  Because AEP currently uses surface impoundments and landfills to manage CCR materials at generating facilities, significant costs will be incurred to upgrade or close and replace these existing facilities at some point in the future as the new rule is implemented.  Management recorded a $95 million increase in asset retirement obligations in the second quarter of 2015 primarily due to the publication of the final rule.  Management will continue to evaluate the rule s impact on operations.  
    
  In February 2014, the Federal EPA completed a risk evaluation of the beneficial uses of coal fly ash in concrete and FGD gypsum in wallboard and concluded that the Federal EPA supports these beneficial uses.  Currently, approximately 40% of the coal ash and other residual products from AEP s generating facilities are re-used in the production of cement and wallboard, as structural fill or soil amendments, as abrasives or road treatment materials and for other beneficial uses.  Encapsulated beneficial uses are not materially impacted by the new rule but additional demonstrations may be required to continue land applications in significant amounts except in road construction projects.  
    
  Clean Water Act (CWA) Regulations 
    
  In 2014, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant s cooling water intake screen (impingement) or entrained in the cooling water.  Entrainment is when small fish, eggs or larvae are drawn into the cooling water system and affected by heat, chemicals or physical stress.  The final rule affects all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day.  The rule offers seven technology options to comply with the impingement standard and requires site-specific studies to determine appropriate entrainment compliance measures at facilities withdrawing more than 125 million gallons per day.  Additional requirements may be imposed as a result of consultation with other federal agencies to protect threatened and endangered species and their habitats.  Facilities with existing closed cycle recirculating cooling systems, as defined in the rule, are not expected to require any technology changes.  Facilities subject to both the impingement standard and site-specific entrainment studies will typically be given at least three years to conduct and submit the results of those studies to the permit agency.  Compliance timeframes will then be established by the permit agency through each facility s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for installation of any required technology changes, as those permits are renewed over the next five to eight years.  Petitions for review of the final rule were filed by industry and environmental groups and are currently pending in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Briefs by the various parties are due during the fourth quarter of 2016. 
    
  In addition, the Federal EPA developed revised effluent limitation guidelines for electricity generating facilities.  A final rule was issued in November 2015.  The rule has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.  Industry petitioners, including SWEPCo, have filed a joint motion for reconsideration of the single judge order denying the motion to complete the administrative record.  In addition to other requirements, the final rule establishes limits on flue gas desulfurization wastewater, zero discharge for fly ash and bottom ash transport water and flue gas mercury control wastewater.  The applicability of these requirements is as soon as possible after November 2018 and no later than December 2023.  These new requirements will be implemented through each facility s wastewater discharge permit.  Management continues to assess technology additions and retrofits. 
  
   15 

In June 2015, the Federal EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers jointly issued a final rule to clarify the scope of the regulatory definition of  waters of the United States  in light of recent U.S. Supreme Court cases.  The CWA provides for federal jurisdiction over  navigable waters  defined as  the waters of the United States.   This jurisdictional definition applies to all CWA programs, potentially impacting generation, transmission and distribution permitting and compliance requirements.  Among those programs are: permits for wastewater and storm water discharges, permits for impacts to wetlands and water bodies and oil spill prevention planning.  The final definition continues to recognize traditional navigable waters of the U.S. as jurisdictional as well as certain exclusions. The rule also contains a number of new specific definitions and criteria for determining whether certain other waters are jurisdictional because of a  significant nexus.   Management believes that clarity and efficiency in the permitting process is needed.  Management remains concerned that the rule introduces new concepts and could subject more of AEP s operations to CWA jurisdiction, thereby increasing the time and complexity of permitting.  The final rule is being challenged in both courts of appeal and district courts.  Challengers include industry associations of which AEP is a member.  The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted a nationwide stay of the rule pending jurisdictional determinations.  In February 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a decision holding that it has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the challenges to the  waters of the United States  rule.  Industry, state and related associations have filed petitions for a rehearing of the jurisdictional decision.  In April 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit denied the petitions and proceeded to issue a case management order for the merits of the case.  In September 2016, the case management order was held in abeyance pending the court s ruling on the outstanding motions to complete the administrative record.  In October 2016, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued an order granting in part and denying in part the motions to complete the record.  Following this order, a revised case management order was issued scheduling briefing to be completed by March 2017.  No date for oral argument has been set.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  SEGMENTS 
    
  AEP s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.  Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight.  Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. 
    
  AEP s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below: 
    
  Vertically Integrated Utilities 

Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. 
       
  Transmission and Distribution Utilities 

Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by OPCo, TCC and TNC. 
                
    OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve SSO customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load. 
       
  AEP Transmission Holdco 

Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEP s wholly-owned transmission-only subsidiaries and transmission-only joint ventures.  These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved returns on equity. 
       
  Generation   Marketing 

Competitive generation in ERCOT and PJM. 
                
    Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO. 
       
  The remainder of AEP s activities is presented as Corporate and Other.  While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs.  With the sale of AEPRO in November 2015, the activities related to the AEP River Operations segment have been moved to Corporate and Other for the periods presented.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other Segment)  section of Note   6   for additional information. 
    
  The following discussion of AEP s results of operations by operating segment includes an analysis of gross margin, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Gross margin includes Total Revenues less the costs of Fuel and Other Consumables Used for Electric Generation as well as Purchased Electricity for Resale, as presented in AEP s statements of operations.  These expenses are generally collected from customers through cost recovery mechanisms.  As such, management uses gross margin for internal reporting analysis as it excludes the fluctuations in revenue caused by changes in these expenses.  Operating income, which is presented in accordance with GAAP in AEP s statements of operations, is the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure to the presentation of gross margin.   AEP s definition of gross margin may not be directly comparable to similarly titled financial measures used by other companies.

AEP CONSOLIDATED 
    
  Third Quarter of 2016   Compared to   Third Quarter of 2015 
    
  Earnings (Loss) Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders decreased from income of   $518 million   in   2015   to a loss of   $766 million   in   2016   primarily due to: 

An impairment of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    A decrease in weather-normalized sales. 
       
  These decreases were partially offset by: 

A decrease in system income taxes primarily due to reduced pretax book income as a result of the impairment of certain merchant generation assets as well as the reversal of valuation allowances related to the pending sale of certain merchant generation assets, as well as favorable 2015 income tax return adjustments related to AEP s commercial barging operations. 
                
    An increase in weather-related usage. 
                
    Favorable rate proceedings in AEP s various jurisdictions. 
                
    An increase due to increased revenues from Ohio transmission and distribution riders. 
                
    An increase in income at AEP Transmission Holdco as a result of increased transmission investment and related increases in recoverable operating expenses. 
       
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Earnings (Loss) Attributable to AEP Common Shareholders decreased from income of   $1.6 billion   in   2015   to income of $238 million in   2016   primarily due to: 

An impairment of certain merchant generation assets. 
                
    A decrease in generation revenues due to lower capacity revenue and a decrease in wholesale energy prices. 
                
    A decrease in weather-related usage. 
       
  These decreases were partially offset by: 

A decrease in system income taxes primarily due to reduced pretax book income as a result of the impairment of certain merchant generation assets as well as the reversal of valuation allowances related to the pending sale of certain merchant generation assets and the settlement of a 2011 audit issue with the IRS, as well as favorable 2015 income tax return adjustments related to AEP s commercial barging operations. 
                
    An increase due to increased revenues from Ohio transmission and distribution riders. 
                
    An increase in income at AEP Transmission Holdco as a result of increased transmission investment as well as an increase due to annual formula rate true-up adjustments.

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $  136 million   primarily due to the following: 
                
    The effect of rate proceedings in AEP s service territories which included: 
                
    A $35 million increase due to increases in rates in West Virginia and Virginia. 
                
    A $24 million increase for PSO due to interim base rate increases. 
                
    A $17 million increase for I M due to increases in riders in the Indiana service territory. 
                
    A $16 million increase for KPCo primarily due to increases in base rates and riders. 
                
    A $6 million increase for SWEPCo due to revenue increases from rate riders in Texas and Arkansas. 
     For the increases described above, $55 million relate to riders/trackers which have corresponding increases in expense items below. 
             
    A $53 million increase in weather-related usage. 
                
    A $3 million increase for SWEPCo in municipal and cooperative revenues due to formula rate adjustments. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $27 million decrease primarily due to lower weather-normalized margins. 
                
    Margins from Off-system Sales   increased $4 million primarily due to increased sales volumes. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   increased $13 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $5 million accrual for SPP sponsor-funded transmission upgrades.  This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses below. 
                
    A $5 million increase due to higher Network Integration Transmission Service revenues associated with increased transmission investments. 
     
   21 

A $4 million increase in SPP Non-Affiliated Base Plan Funding associated with increased transmission investments.  This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses below. 
                
    Other Revenues   increased $4 million primarily due to increased revenues from Demand Side Management (DSM) programs in Kentucky. 
       
  Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $20 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $51 million increase in recoverable expenses, primarily including PJM, Big Sandy Unit 1 operation rider, energy efficiency and vegetation management expenses fully recovered in rate recovery riders/trackers. 
                
    A $17 million increase associated with amortization of deferred transmission costs in accordance with the Virginia Transmission Rate Adjustment Clause effective January 2016.  This increase in expense is offset within Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $12 million accrual for SPP sponsor-funded transmission upgrades.  This increase was partially offset by a corresponding increase in Transmission Revenues above. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $33 million decrease in employee and AEPSC related expenses. 
                
    An $18 million decrease in plant outages and maintenance primarily in the eastern region. 
                
    A $6 million decrease in vegetation management expenses. 
                
    Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges   increased $11 million due to the impairment of I M s Price River Coal reserves. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses increased $14 million     primarily due to: 
                
    A $12 million increase due to a higher depreciable base. 
                
    A $9 million increase in depreciation primarily related to interim rate increases in Oklahoma. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
     A $3 million decrease in amortization related to the advanced metering infrastructure projects in Oklahoma. 
                
    A $3 million decrease in the amortization of capitalized software due to prior year retirements. 
                
    Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction   decreased $5 million     primarily due to the completion of environmental projects at SWEPCo. 
                
    Interest Expense   increased $8 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $4 million increase due to higher long-term debt balances at I M. 
                
    A $4 million increase due to a decrease in the debt component of AFUDC as a result of decreased environmental projects at SWEPCo. 
                
    Income Tax     Expense   increased $30 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income.

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $192 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    The effect of rate proceedings in AEP s service territories which include: 
                
    A $120 million increase primarily due to increases in rates in West Virginia and Virginia, which includes recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia as approved by the WVPSC in June 2016.  This increase is partially offset by a prior year adjustment affected by the amended Virginia law that has an impact on biennial reviews. 
                
    A $45 million increase for KPCo primarily due to increases in base rates and riders. 
                
    A $43 million increase for PSO due to interim base rate increases. 
                
    A $29 million increase for I M due to increases in riders in the Indiana service territory. 
                
    A $16 million increase for SWEPCo due to revenue increases from rate riders in Arkansas and Texas. 
     For the increases described above, $139 million relate to riders/trackers which have corresponding increases in expense items below. 
  These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $29 million decrease in weather-related usage. 
                
    A $14 million decrease in weather-normalized margins primarily in the eastern region. 
                
    A $22 million decrease for SWEPCo in municipal and cooperative revenues due to a true-up of formula rates in 2015. 
                
    A $12 million decrease for I M in FERC municipal and cooperative revenues due to annual formula rate adjustments offset by increased formula rate changes. 
     
   23 

Margins from Off-system Sales   decreased $20 million primarily due to lower market prices and decreased sales volumes. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   decreased $14 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $26 million decrease due to lower Network Integration Transmission Service revenues. 
     This decrease was partially offset by: 
             
     A $9 million increase in SPP Non-Affiliated Base Plan Funding associated with increased transmission investments.  This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses below.

    Amounts include debt related to the Lawrenceburg Plant that has been classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet.  See  Gavin, Waterford, Darby and Lawrenceburg Plants (Generation   Marketing Segment)  section of Note   6   for additional information. 
     
   38 

AEP s ratio of debt-to-total capital changed primarily due to a decrease in common equity as a result of the impairment of certain merchant generation assets. 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  Liquidity, or access to cash, is an important factor in determining AEP s financial stability.  Management believes AEP has adequate liquidity under its existing credit facilities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , AEP had   $3.5 billion   in aggregate credit facility commitments to support its operations.  Additional liquidity is available from cash from operations and a receivables securitization agreement.  Management is committed to maintaining adequate liquidity.  AEP generally uses short-term borrowings to fund working capital needs, property acquisitions and construction until long-term funding is arranged.  Sources of long-term funding include issuance of long-term debt, sale-leaseback or leasing agreements or common stock. 
    
  Commercial Paper Credit Facilities 
    
  AEP manages liquidity by maintaining adequate external financing commitments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , available liquidity was approximately   $3 billion   as illustrated in the table below: 

AEP has two credit facilities totaling   $3.5 billion   to support its commercial paper program.  The $3 billion credit facility allows management to issue letters of credit in an amount up to $1.2 billion. 
    
  AEP uses its commercial paper program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of its subsidiaries.  The program is used to fund both a Utility Money Pool, which funds the utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain nonutility subsidiaries.  In addition, the program also funds, as direct borrowers, the short-term debt requirements of other subsidiaries that are not participants in either money pool for regulatory or operational reasons.  The maximum amount of commercial paper outstanding during the first   nine   months of   2016   was $1.5 billion.  The weighted-average interest rate for AEP s commercial paper during   2016   was 0.77%. 
    
  Other Credit Facilities 
    
  An uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility.  AEP issues letters of credit under four uncommitted facilities totaling $300 million.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum future payment for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities was $147 million with maturities ranging from October 2016 to September 2017.   
    
  Securitized Accounts Receivable 
    
  AEP s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of   $750 million   from bank conduits to purchase receivables.  The agreement expires in   June 2018  . 

39 

Debt Covenants and Borrowing Limitations 
    
  AEP s credit agreements contain certain covenants and require it to maintain a percentage of debt to total capitalization at a level that does not exceed 67.5%.  The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually defined in AEP s credit agreements.  Debt as defined in the revolving credit agreements excludes securitization bonds and debt of AEP Credit.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,     this contractually-defined percentage was 52.7%.  Nonperformance under these covenants could result in an event of default under these credit agreements.  In addition, the acceleration of AEP s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of AEP s major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements.  This condition also applies in a majority of AEP s non-exchange traded commodity contracts and would similarly allow lenders and counterparties to declare the outstanding amounts payable.  However, a default under AEP s non-exchange traded commodity contracts would not cause an event of default under its credit agreements. 
    
  The revolving credit facilities do not permit the lenders to refuse a draw on any facility if a material adverse change occurs. 
    
  Utility Money Pool borrowings and external borrowings may not exceed amounts authorized by regulatory orders and AEP manages its borrowings to stay within those authorized limits. 
    
  Dividend Policy and Restrictions 
    
  The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.59 per share in October   2016  .  Future dividends may vary depending upon AEP s profit levels, operating cash flow levels and capital requirements, as well as financial and other business conditions existing at the time.  Parent s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries.  Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends. 
    
  Management does not believe these restrictions related to AEP s various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements will have any significant impact on its ability to access cash to meet the payment of dividends on its common stock. 
    
  Credit Ratings 
    
  AEP does not have any credit arrangements that would require material changes in payment schedules or terminations as a result of a credit downgrade, but its access to the commercial paper market may depend on their credit ratings.  In addition, downgrades in AEP s credit ratings by one of the rating agencies could increase its borrowing costs.  Counterparty concerns about the credit quality of AEP or its utility subsidiaries could subject AEP to additional collateral demands under adequate assurance clauses under its derivative and non-derivative energy contracts. 
    
  CASH FLOW 
    
  AEP relies primarily on cash flows from operations, debt issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and investing activities.  AEP s investing and capital requirements are primarily capital expenditures, repaying of long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. 

40 

AEP uses short-term debt, including commercial paper, as a bridge to long-term debt financing.  The levels of borrowing may vary significantly due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows. 
    
  Operating Activities 

Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities were $3.4 billion in   2016   consisting primarily of Net Income of $245 million and $1.6 billion of noncash Depreciation and Amortization.  AEP also had asset impairments of $2.3 billion during the third quarter of 2016.  See Note   6   - Dispositions, Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Impairments for a complete discussion of asset impairments and other related charges.  Accrued Taxes decreased primarily due to the impacts of bonus depreciation related to the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015.  Deferred Income Taxes decreased primarily due to the tax effect of the asset impairment partially offset by an increase in tax versus book temporary differences from operations, which includes provisions related to the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015.  Other changes represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital, as well as items that represent future rights or obligations to receive or pay cash, such as regulatory assets and liabilities.   
    
  Net Cash Flows from Continuing Operating Activities were $3.9 billion in   2015   consisting primarily of Net Income of $1.6 billion and $1.5 billion of noncash Depreciation and Amortization.  Other changes represent items that had a current period cash flow impact, such as changes in working capital, as well as items that represent future rights or obligations to receive or pay cash, such as regulatory assets and liabilities.  Deferred Income Taxes increased primarily due to provisions in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 2014 and an increase in tax/book temporary differences from operations.  The reduction in Fuel, Materials and Supplies balances reflects a decrease in fuel inventory due to the cold winter weather and plants retired during the second quarter of 2015. 
    
  Investing Activities 

Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Investing Activities were $3.4 billion in   2016   primarily due to Construction Expenditures for environmental, distribution and transmission investments.  
    
  Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Investing Activities were $3.2 billion in   2015   primarily due to Construction Expenditures for environmental, distribution and transmission investments. 

41 

Financing Activities 

Net Cash Flows from Continuing Financing Activities in   2016   were $46 million.  AEP s net debt issuances were $930 million. The net issuances included an increase in short-term borrowing of $678 million, issuances of $950 million of senior unsecured notes, $191 million of pollution control bonds and $430 million of other debt notes offset by retirements of $507 million of senior unsecured notes, $289 million of securitization bonds, $251 million of pollution control bonds and $261 million of other debt notes.  AEP paid common stock dividends of $830 million.  See Note   12   - Financing Activities for a complete discussion of long-term debt issuances and retirements. 
    
  Net Cash Flows Used for Continuing Financing Activities in   2015   were $647 million.  AEP s net debt issuances were $236 million. The net issuances included issuances of $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes, $140 million of pollution control bonds and $757 million of other debt notes offset by retirements of $907 million of senior unsecured notes, $308 million of securitization bonds, $229 million of pollution control bonds and $687 of other debt notes and a decrease in short term borrowing of $564 million.  AEP paid common stock dividends of $783 million.  Other includes a make whole premium payment on the extinguishment of long-term debt of $93 million in addition to capital lease principal payments of $74 million.  See Note   12   - Financing Activities for a complete discussion of long-term debt issuances and retirements. 
    
  In October 2016, I M retired   $16 million   of Notes Payable related to DCC Fuel. 
    
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  AEP s current guidelines restrict the use of off-balance sheet financing entities or structures to traditional operating lease arrangements that AEP enters in the normal course of business.  The following identifies significant off-balance sheet arrangements: 

For complete information on each of these off-balance sheet arrangements, see the  Off-balance Sheet Arrangements  section of  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the   2015   Annual Report. 

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION INFORMATION 
    
  A summary of contractual obligations is included in the   2015   Annual Report and has not changed significantly from year-end other than the debt issuances and retirements discussed in the  Cash Flow  section above.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES, NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  See the  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  section of  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the   2015   Annual Report for a discussion of the estimates and judgments required for regulatory accounting, revenue recognition, derivative instruments, the accounting for pension and other postretirement benefits and the impact of new accounting pronouncements. 
    
  Long-Lived Assets 
    
  Nature of Estimates Required 
    
  In accordance with the requirements of  Property, Plant and Equipment  accounting guidance, the Registrants evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets may not be recoverable including planned abandonments and a probable disallowance for rate-making on a plant under construction or the assets meet the held-for-sale criteria.  The Registrants utilize a group composite method of depreciation to estimate the useful lives of long-lived assets.  The evaluations of long-lived, held and used assets may result from abandonments, significant decreases in the market price of an asset, a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset, as well as other economic or operations analyses.  If the carrying amount is not recoverable, the Registrants record an impairment to the extent that the fair value of the asset is less than its book value.  Performing an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted and discounted future cash flows (used to estimate fair value in the absence of market-based value, in some instances) associated with the asset.  For assets held for sale, an impairment is recognized if the expected net sales price is less than its book value.  For regulated assets, the earnings impact of an impairment charge could be offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset, if rate recovery is probable.  For nonregulated assets, any impairment charge is recorded against earnings. 
    
  Assumptions and Approach Used 
    
  The fair value of an asset is the amount at which that asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  Quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement, if available.  In the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets in active markets, the Registrants estimate fair value using various internal and external valuation methods including cash flow projections or other market indicators of fair value such as bids received, comparable sales or independent appraisals.  Cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made.  Estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results.  Also, when measuring fair value, management evaluates the characteristics of the asset or liability to determine if market participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date.  Such characteristics include, for example, the condition and location of the asset or restrictions of the use of the asset.  The Registrants perform depreciation studies that include a review of any external factors that may affect the useful life to determine composite depreciation rates and related lives which are subject to periodic review by state regulatory commissions for cost-based regulated assets.  The fair value of the asset could be different using different estimates and assumptions in these valuation techniques. 
    
  Effect if Different Assumptions Used 
    
  In connection with the evaluation of long-lived assets in accordance with the requirements of  Property, Plant and Equipment  accounting guidance, the fair value of the asset can vary if different estimates and assumptions would have been used in the applied valuation techniques.  The estimate for depreciation rates takes into account the history of interim capital replacements and the amount of salvage expected.  In cases of impairment, the best estimate of fair value was made using valuation methods based on the most current information at that time.  Fluctuations in realized  
  
   43 

sales proceeds versus the estimated fair value of the asset are generally due to a variety of factors including, but not limited to, differences in subsequent market conditions, the level of bidder interest, timing and terms of the transactions and management s analysis of the benefits of the transaction. 
    
  ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During 2016 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2015-01  Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items  eliminating the concept of extraordinary items for presentation on the face of the statements of income.  Under the new standard, a material event or transaction that is unusual in nature, infrequent or both shall be reported as a separate component of income from continuing operations.  Alternatively, it may be disclosed in the notes to financial statements.  Management adopted ASU 2015-01 effective January 1, 2016. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2015-05  Customer s Accounting for Fees paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  providing guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted.  Management adopted ASU 2015-05 prospectively, effective January 1, 2016, with no impact on results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
    
  Pronouncements Effective in the Future 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  clarifying the method used to determine the timing and requirements for revenue recognition on the statements of income.  Under the new standard, an entity must identify the performance obligations in a contract, determine the transaction price and allocate the price to specific performance obligations to recognize the revenue when the obligation is completed.  The amendments in this update also require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contracts.  The FASB deferred implementation of ASU 2014-09 under the terms in ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.   The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and the related ASUs that clarify guidance in the standard.  At this time, management cannot estimate the impact of adoption on revenue or net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2015-11  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  to simplify the guidance on the subsequent measurement of inventory, excluding inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method.  Under the new standard, inventory should be at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  Management does not expect the new standard to impact the Registrants  results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2015-11 prospectively, effective January 1, 2017. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2016-01  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  enhancing the reporting model for financial instruments.  Under the new standard, equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  The new standard also amends disclosure requirements and requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  The amendments also clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  The amendments will be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption on net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018. 
  
   44 

The FASB issued ASU 2016-02  Accounting for Leases  increasing the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheets and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  Under the new standard, an entity must recognize an asset and liability for operating leases on the balance sheets.  Additionally, a capital lease will be known as a finance lease going forward.  Leases with lease terms of 12 months or longer will be subject to the new requirements.  Fundamentally, the criteria used to determine lease classification will remain the same, but will be more subjective under the new standard.  The new accounting guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.  The guidance will be applied by means of a modified retrospective approach.  The modified retrospective approach will require lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented as well as a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption.  Management expects the new standard to impact the Registrants  financial position, but not the Registrants  results of operations or cash flows.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2016-09  Compensation   Stock Compensation  simplifying the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows.  Under the new standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the statements of income.  Under current GAAP, excess tax benefits are recognized in additional paid-in capital while tax deficiencies are recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits, if any, or on the statements of income.  The new accounting guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  Certain provisions require retrospective/modified retrospective transition while others are to be applied prospectively.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017. 
    
  The FASB issued ASU 2016-13  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  requiring an allowance to be recorded for all expected credit losses for financial assets.  The allowance for credit losses is based on historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The new standard also makes revisions to the other than temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities.  Disclosures of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables are further disaggregated by year of origination.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The amendments will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption on net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020. 
    
  Future Accounting Changes 
    
  The FASB s standard-setting process is ongoing and until new standards have been finalized and issued, management cannot determine the impact on the reporting of operations and financial position that may result from any such future changes.  The FASB is currently working on several projects including hedge accounting, consolidations and pension and postretirement benefits.  The ultimate pronouncements resulting from these and future projects could have an impact on future net income and financial position.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  Market Risks 
    
  The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment is exposed to certain market risks as a major power producer and through transactions in power, coal, natural gas and marketing contracts.  These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk.  In addition, this segment is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk from occasionally procuring various services and materials used in its energy business from foreign suppliers.  These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates. 
    
  The Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment is exposed to energy procurement risk and interest rate risk. 
    
  The Generation   Marketing segment conducts marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO.  This segment is exposed to certain market risks as a marketer of wholesale and retail electricity.  These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, credit risk as well as interest rate risk.  These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact this segment due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates.  In addition, the Generation   Marketing segment is also exposed to certain market risks as a major power producer and through transactions in wholesale electricity, natural gas and marketing contracts. 
    
  Management employs risk management contracts including physical forward purchase-and-sale contracts and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts.  Management engages in risk management of power, capacity, coal, natural gas and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business.  As a result, AEP is subject to price risk.  The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors.  AEPSC s market risk oversight staff independently monitors  risk policies, procedures and risk levels and provides members of the Commercial Operations Risk Committee (Regulated Risk Committee) and the Energy Supply Risk Committee (Competitive Risk Committee) various reports regarding compliance with policies, limits and procedures.  The Regulated Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President of Generation, Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations and Chief Risk Officer.  The Competitive Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Risk Officer in addition to Energy Supply s President and Vice President.  When commercial activities exceed predetermined limits, positions are modified to reduce the risk to be within the limits unless specifically approved by the respective committee. 

46 

The following table summarizes the reasons for changes in total MTM value as compared to   December 31, 2015  : 

(a) 
    Reflects fair value on primarily long-term structured contracts which are typically with customers that seek fixed pricing to limit their risk against fluctuating energy prices.  The contract prices are valued against market curves associated with the delivery location and delivery term.  A significant portion of the total volumetric position has been economically hedged. 
              (b) 
    Market fluctuations are attributable to various factors such as supply/demand, weather, etc. 
              (c) 
    Relates to the net gains (losses) of those contracts that are not reflected on the statements of income.  These net gains  (losses) are recorded as regulatory liabilities/assets. 
       
  See Note   9     Derivatives and Hedging and Note   10     Fair Value Measurements for additional information related to risk management contracts. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  Credit risk is limited in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis.  Management uses Moody s Investors Service, Standard   Poor s and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis.  

47 

AEP has risk management contracts with numerous counterparties.  Since open risk management contracts are valued based on changes in market prices of the related commodities, exposures change daily.  As of   September 30, 2016  , credit exposure net of collateral to sub investment grade counterparties was approximately 7.1%, expressed in terms of net MTM assets, net receivables and the net open positions for contracts not subject to MTM (representing economic risk even though there may not be risk of accounting loss).  As of   September 30, 2016  , the following table approximates AEP s counterparty credit quality and exposure based on netting across commodities, instruments and legal entities where applicable: 

In addition, AEP is exposed to credit risk related to participation in RTOs.  For each of the RTOs in which AEP participates, this risk is generally determined based on the proportionate share of member gross activity over a specified period of time. 
    
  Value at Risk (VaR) Associated with Risk Management Contracts 
    
  Management uses a risk measurement model, which calculates VaR, to measure AEP s commodity price risk in the risk management portfolio.  The VaR is based on the variance-covariance method using historical prices to estimate volatilities and correlations and assumes a 95% confidence level and a one-day holding period.  Based on this VaR analysis, as of   September 30, 2016  , a near term typical change in commodity prices is not expected to materially impact net income, cash flows or financial condition. 
    
  Management calculates the VaR for both a trading and non-trading portfolio.  The trading portfolio consists primarily of contracts related to energy trading and marketing activities.  The non-trading portfolio consists primarily of economic hedges of generation and retail supply activities.  The following tables show the end, high, average and low market risk as measured by VaR for the periods indicated: 
    
  VaR Model 
  Trading Portfolio 

VaR Model 
  Non-Trading Portfolio 

48 

Management back-tests VaR results against performance due to actual price movements.  Based on the assumed 95% confidence interval, the performance due to actual price movements would be expected to exceed the VaR at least once every 20 trading days. 
    
  As the VaR calculation captures recent price movements, management also performs regular stress testing of the trading portfolio to understand AEP s exposure to extreme price movements.  A historical-based method is employed whereby the current trading portfolio is subjected to actual, observed price movements from the last several years in order to ascertain which historical price movements translated into the largest potential MTM loss.  Management then researches the underlying positions, price movements and market events that created the most significant exposure and reports the findings to the Risk Executive Committee, Regulated Risk Committee, or Competitive Risk Committee as appropriate. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Management utilizes an Earnings at Risk (EaR) model to measure interest rate market risk exposure.  EaR statistically quantifies the extent to which interest expense could vary over the next twelve months and gives a probabilistic estimate of different levels of interest expense.  The resulting EaR is interpreted as the dollar amount by which actual interest expense for the next twelve months could exceed expected interest expense with a one-in-twenty chance of occurrence.  The primary drivers of EaR are from the existing floating rate debt (including short-term debt) as well as long-term debt issuances in the next twelve months.  As calculated on debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated EaR on AEP s debt portfolio for the following twelve months was $30 million and $25 million, respectively.

Third Quarter of 2016   Compared to   Third Quarter of 2015 

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $54 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $34 million increase primarily due to increases in rates in West Virginia and Virginia.  Of these rate increases, $27 million relates to riders/trackers which have corresponding increases in other expense items below. 
                
    A $24 million increase in weather-related usage primarily due to a 30% increase in cooling degree days. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    An $8 million decrease in weather-normalized margin in all retail classes. 
       
  Expenses and Other changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $12 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $17 million increase associated with amortization of deferred transmission costs in accordance with the Virginia Transmission Rate Adjustment Clause effective January 2016.  This increase in expense is offset within Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $7 million increase in PJM transmission expenses.  This increase in expense is offset within Retail Margins above. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $6 million decrease in employee-related expenses. 
                
    A $2 million decrease in storm-related expenses. 
                
    A $2 million decrease in distribution expenses primarily due to prior year vegetation pilot program.  
                
    Income Tax Expense   increased $18 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income. 
     
   58 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $93 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $111 million increase primarily due to increases in rates in West Virginia and Virginia, which includes recognition of deferred billing in West Virginia as approved by the WVPSC in June 2016.  This increase is partially offset by a prior year adjustment affected by the amended Virginia law that has an impact on biennial reviews.  Of these rate increases, $81 million relate to riders/trackers which have corresponding increases in other expense items below. 
     This increase was partially offset by: 
             
    A $20 million decrease in weather-normalized margin primarily in the industrial class. 
                
    A $10 million decrease in weather-related usage due to a 17% decrease in heating degree days offset with a 13% increase in cooling degree days. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   decreased $14 million primarily due to lower Network Integrated Transmission Service revenues.  

59 

Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $54 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $41 million increase associated with amortization of deferred transmission costs in accordance with the Virginia Transmission Rate Adjustment Clause effective January 2016.  This increase in expense is offset within Retail Margins above. 
                
    An $8 million increase in distribution expenses primarily due to vegetation management.  This increase in expense is offset within Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $5 million increase in amortization of previously deferred West Virginia storm expenses as approved in the May 2015 West Virginia base case order.  This increase in expense is offset within Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $4 million increase in storm-related expenses. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $6 million gain on the sale of property in the current year. 
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses decreased $3 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $7 million decrease in asset retirement obligations and plant amortizations due to plant retirements in 2015. 
                
    A $2 million decrease due to prior year amortization of Virginia environmental deferrals.  This decrease in expense is offset within Retail Margins above.  
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $6 million increase due to a higher depreciable base. 
                
    Interest Expense   decreased $5 million primarily due to lower interest rates on long-term debt. 
                
    Income Tax Expense   increased $4 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income and by the recording of federal income tax adjustments, partially offset by other book/tax differences which are accounted for on a flow-through basis and the regulatory accounting treatment of state income taxes.

Third Quarter of 2016   Compared to   Third Quarter of 2015 

The major components of the increase in Gross Margin, defined as revenues less the related direct cost of fuel, including consumption of chemicals and emissions allowances, and purchased electricity were as follows: 

Retail Margins   increased $31 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $17 million increase from rate proceedings in the Indiana service territory.  The increase in retail margins relating to riders has corresponding increases in other items below. 
                
    A $15 million increase in weather-related usage due to a 40% increase in cooling degree days. 
                
    An $8 million increase in weather-normalized margins. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $6 million decrease in fuel recovery from wholesale customers due to the timing of fuel recovery in 2015 primarily as a result of an extended forced outage at Cook Plant, Unit 1. 
                
    A $2 million decrease due to PJM charges not currently recovered in rate recovery riders/trackers. 
                
    Other Revenues   decreased $3 million primarily due to a decrease in barging deliveries to the Rockport Plant by River Transportation Division (RTD).  The decrease in RTD revenue was offset by a corresponding decrease in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses for barging activities discussed below. 

69 

Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses decreased $10 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $10 million decrease in nuclear expenses primarily due to an extended forced outage at Cook Plant, Unit 1 related to the emergency diesel generator repair in 2015. 
                
    A $4 million decrease in general and administrative expenses. 
                
    A $4 million decrease in RTD expenses for barging activities.  The decrease in RTD expenses was offset by a corresponding decrease in Other Revenues from barging activities discussed above. 
                
    A $3 million decrease in steam generation maintenance expenses at Rockport in addition to the retirement of Tanners Creek Plant in May 2015. 
     These decreases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $5 million increase in distribution expenses primarily due to increased forestry expenses. 
                
    A $2 million increase in transmission expenses primarily due to increased PJM expenses. 
                
    A $2 million increase in accretion due to the impact of a revision in the nuclear Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) estimate on decommissioning expense.  This increase has a corresponding offset in Depreciation and Amortization expenses. 
                
    Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges   increased $11 million due to the impairment of I M s Price River coal reserves. 
                
    Interest Expense   increased $4 million primarily due to higher long-term debt balances.

Retail Margins   increased $32 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $29 million increase from rate proceedings in the Indiana service territory.  The increase in retail margins relating to riders has corresponding increases in other items below. 
                
    A $21 million increase in weather-normalized margins. 
     These increases were partially offset by:   
             
    A $12 million decrease in FERC municipal and cooperative revenues due to annual formula rate adjustments offset by increased formula rate changes. 
                
    A $3 million decrease in fuel recovery from wholesale customers due to the timing of fuel recovery in 2015 primarily as a result of an extended forced outage at Cook Plant, Unit 1. 
                
    Margins from Off-system Sales   decreased $10 million primarily due to lower market prices and decreased sales volumes. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   decreased $6 million primarily due to a lower transmission formula rate true-up than in the prior year, partially offset by higher Network Integration Transmission Service revenues.

     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $16 million decrease in revenues associated with the recovery of 2012 storm costs under the Storm Damage Recovery Rider which ended in April 2015.  This decrease in Retail Margins is primarily offset by a decrease in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses below. 
                
    Margins from Off-system Sales   decreased $6 million primarily due to increased losses from a power contract with OVEC. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   decreased $37 million primarily due to the following:  
                
    A $55 million decrease in NITS revenue primarily due to OPCo assuming the responsibility for items determined to be cost-based transmission-related charges that were the responsibility of the CRES providers prior to June 2015, partially offset by a corresponding increase in Retail Margins above. 
     This decrease was partially offset by: 
             
    A $19 million increase due to a settlement recorded in 2015, a decrease in amortization of the formula rate true-up and the recording of the current year formula rate true-up in 2016. 
     
   83 

Expenses and Other and Income Tax Expense changed between years as follows: 

Other Operation and Maintenance   expenses increased $62 million primarily due to the following:  
                
    A $46 million increase in recoverable PJM expenses. 
                
    A $25 million increase in recoverable   gridSMART        expenses. 
                
    A $15 million increase in remitted USF surcharge payments to the Ohio Department of Development to fund an energy assistance program for qualified Ohio customers.  This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Retail Margins above.  
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $14 million decrease due to the completion of the amortization of 2012 deferred storm expenses in April 2015.  This decrease was offset by a corresponding decrease in Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $6 million decrease due to a PUCO ordered contribution to the Ohio Growth Fund recorded in 2015. 
                
    A $5 million decrease in employee-related expenses.  
                
    Depreciation and Amortization   expenses increased $10 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    An $8 million increase due to recoveries of transmission cost rider carrying costs.  The increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Retail Margins above.  
                
    A $6 million increase in amortization expenses for the collection of carrying costs on deferred capacity charges beginning June 2015.  This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Retail Margins above. 
                
    A $6 million increase in depreciation expense primarily due to an increase in depreciable base of transmission and distribution assets. 
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    An $11 million decrease in recoverable   gridSMART        depreciation expenses.  
                
    Taxes Other Than Income Taxes   increased $9 million primarily due to additional investments in transmission and distribution assets and higher tax rates. 
                
    Carrying Costs Income   decreased $6 million primarily due to the following: 
                
    A $10 million decrease due to the collection of carrying costs on deferred capacity charges beginning June 2015. 
     This decrease was partially offset by: 
             
    A $4 million increase primarily due to an unfavorable prior period adjustment related to   gridSMART        capital carrying charges. 
                
    Interest     Expense     decreased $9 million primarily due to     the following: 
                
    A $7 million decrease due to the maturity of a senior unsecured note in June 2016. 
                
    A $3 million decrease in recoverable   gridSMART        interest expenses.  
                
    Income Tax Expense   increased $22 million primarily due to an increase in pretax book income partially offset by the recording of federal income tax adjustments and by other book/tax differences which are accounted for on a flow-through basis.

    A $3 million increase in municipal and cooperative revenues due to formula rate adjustments.  
     These increases were partially offset by: 
             
    A $3 million decrease due to lower weather-normalized margins. 
                
    Transmission Revenues   increased $12 million primarily due to an $8 million accrual for SPP sponsor-funded transmission upgrades and an additional $4 million due to increased transmission investments in SPP.

    A $2 million decrease in customer related expenses. 
                
    Allowance for Equity Funds Used During Construction   decreased $7 million primarily due to the completion of environmental projects. 
                
    Interest Expense   increased $3 million due to a decrease in the debt component of AFUDC as a result of decreased environmental projects.

    Transmission Revenues   increased $19 million primarily due to an additional $9 million in increased transmission investments in SPP and an $8 million accrual for SPP sponsor-funded transmission upgrades.  This increase was offset by a corresponding increase in Other Operation and Maintenance expenses below. 

105

1  .    SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING MATTERS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  General 
    
  The unaudited condensed financial statements and footnotes were prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the SEC.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete annual financial statements. 
    
  In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed interim financial statements reflect all normal and recurring accruals and adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the net income, financial position and cash flows for the interim periods for each Registrant.  Net income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,   2016  .  The condensed financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the audited   2015   financial statements and notes thereto, which are included in the Registrant s Annual Reports on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC on February 23,   2016  . 
    
  Investment Tax Credits 
    
  Investment tax credits (ITC) were historically accounted for under the flow-through method, except where regulatory commissions reflected ITC in the rate-making process.  In the third quarter of 2016, AEP and subsidiaries changed accounting for the recognition of ITC and elected to apply the preferred deferral methodology.  Retrospective application is not necessary for reporting periods prior to 2016 as the financial impact to AEP and subsidiaries was immaterial. 
    
  Deferred ITC is amortized to income tax expense over the life of the asset.  Amortization of deferred ITC begins when the asset is placed into service, except where regulatory commissions reflect ITC in the rate-making process, then amortization begins when the cash tax benefit is recognized. 
    
  Earnings Per Share (EPS) (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average outstanding common shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive stock options and awards. 
    
  The following tables present AEP s basic and diluted EPS calculations included on the statements of operations: 

114 

There were no antidilutive shares outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

2  .    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  Upon issuance of final pronouncements, management reviews the new accounting literature to determine its relevance, if any, to the Registrants  business.  The following final pronouncements will impact the financial statements. 
    
  ASU 2014-09  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  (ASU 2014-09) 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 clarifying the method used to determine the timing and requirements for revenue recognition on the statements of income.  Under the new standard, an entity must identify the performance obligations in a contract, determine the transaction price and allocate the price to specific performance obligations to recognize the revenue when the obligation is completed.  The amendments in this update also require disclosure of sufficient information to allow users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flow arising from contracts. 
    
  The FASB deferred implementation of ASU 2014-09 under the terms in ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic: 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.   The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  As applicable, this standard may change the amount of revenue recognized on the statements of income in each reporting period.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and the related ASUs that clarify guidance in the standard.  At this time, management cannot estimate the impact of adoption on revenue or net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2014-09 effective January 1, 2018. 
    
  ASU 2015-11  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  (ASU 2015-11) 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11 simplifying the guidance on the subsequent measurement of inventory, excluding inventory measured using last-in, first-out or the retail inventory method.  Under the new standard, inventory should be at the lower of cost and net realizable value.  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted.  Management does not expect the new standard to impact the Registrants  results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2015-11 prospectively, effective January 1, 2017. 
    
  ASU 2016-01  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  (ASU 2016-01) 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 enhancing the reporting model for financial instruments.  Under the new standard, equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are required to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  The new standard also amends disclosure requirements and requires separate presentation of financial assets and liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements.  The amendments also clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  The amendments will be applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption on net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018. 

116 

ASU 2016-02  Accounting for Leases  (ASU 2016-02) 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 increasing the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements.  Under the new standard, an entity must recognize an asset and liability for operating leases on the balance sheets.  Additionally, a capital lease will be known as a finance lease going forward.  Leases with lease terms of 12 months or longer will be subject to the new requirements.  Fundamentally, the criteria used to determine lease classification will remain the same, but will be more subjective under the new standard. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted.  The guidance will be applied by means of a modified retrospective approach.  The modified retrospective approach will require lessees and lessors to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented as well as a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption.  Management expects the new standard to impact the Registrants  financial position, but not the Registrants  results of operations or cash flows.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019. 
    
  ASU 2016-09  Compensation   Stock Compensation  (ASU 2016-09) 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 simplifying the accounting for share-based payment transactions including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows.  Under the new standard, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the statements of income.  Under current GAAP, excess tax benefits are recognized in additional paid-in capital while tax deficiencies are recognized either as an offset to accumulated excess tax benefits, if any, or on the statements of income. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period.  Certain provisions require retrospective/modified retrospective transition while others are to be applied prospectively.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-09 effective January 1, 2017. 
    
  ASU 2016-13  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  (ASU 2016-13) 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 requiring an allowance to be recorded for all expected credit losses for financial assets.  The allowance for credit losses is based on historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  The new standard also makes revisions to the other than temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities.  Disclosures of credit quality indicators in relation to the amortized cost of financing receivables are further disaggregated by year of origination. 
    
  The new accounting guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The amendments will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective.  Management is analyzing the impact of this new standard and, at this time, cannot estimate the impact of adoption on net income.  Management plans to adopt ASU 2016-13 effective January 1, 2020.

  APCo and WPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and APCo) 
    
  2016 West Virginia Expanded Net Energy Cost Filing 
    
  In June 2016, the WVPSC approved a settlement agreement related to APCo and WPCo s combined annual ENEC filing.  The settlement agreement included   $38 million   (  $30 million   related to APCo) of additional ENEC revenues and   $17 million   (  $14 million   related to APCo) in construction surcharges annually for two years, effective July 2016.  Additionally, APCo and WPCo agreed that a general rate case will not be filed before April 2018.  
    
  West Virginia Deferred Base Rate Increase 
    
  In May 2015, the WVPSC issued an order on APCo and WPCo s combined base rate case.  The order included a delayed billing of   $25 million   (  $22 million   related to APCo) of the annual base rate increase to residential customers until July 2016.  In June 2016, the WVPSC issued an order that approved recovery of the total deferred billing, including carrying charges through June 2018, totaling   $29 million   (  $27 million   related to APCo).  Recovery was approved over two years, effective July 2016.  Additionally, at the end of the two-year amortization, any over/under-recovery of the delayed billing will be included in the annual ENEC filing.  The WVPSC also approved implementation of the prospective $25 million base rate increase effective July 2016. 
    
  2015 Virginia Regulatory Asset Proceeding 
    
  In 2015, the Virginia SCC initiated a proceeding to address the treatment of APCo s authorized regulatory assets.  In September 2016, the Virginia SCC issued an order that approved the continued recovery through amortization of certain regulatory assets established prior to the period of frozen rates pursuant to the amended Virginia law (see  Virginia Legislation Affecting Biennial Reviews  below).  
    
  Virginia Legislation Affecting Biennial Reviews 
    
  In February 2015, amendments to Virginia law governing the regulation of investor-owned electric utilities were enacted.  Under the amended Virginia law, APCo s existing generation and distribution base rates are frozen until after the Virginia SCC rules on APCo s next biennial review, which APCo will file in March 2020 for the 2018 and 2019 test years.  These amendments also preclude the Virginia SCC from performing biennial reviews of APCo s earnings for the years 2014 through 2017.  APCo s financial statements adequately address the impact of these amendments.  The amendments provide that APCo will absorb its Virginia jurisdictional share of incremental generation and distribution costs incurred during 2014 through 2017 that are associated with severe weather events and/or natural disasters and costs associated with potential asset impairments related to new carbon emission guidelines issued by the Federal EPA. 
    
  In February 2016, certain APCo industrial customers filed a petition with the Virginia SCC requesting the issuance of a declaratory order that finds the amendments to Virginia law suspending biennial reviews unconstitutional and, accordingly, directs APCo to make biennial review filings beginning in 2016.  In July 2016, the Virginia SCC issued an order that denied the petition.  In July 2016, intervenors, including certain APCo industrial customers, filed an appeal of the order with the Supreme Court of Virginia.  Management is unable to predict the outcome of these challenges to the Virginia legislation.  If the biennial review process is reinstated in advance of March 2020, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 

132 

ETT Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP) 
    
  ETT Interim Transmission Rates 
    
  Parent has a   50%   equity ownership interest in ETT.  Predominantly all of ETT s revenues are based on interim rate changes that can be filed twice annually and are subject to review and possible true-up in the next filed base rate proceeding.  As of   September 30, 2016  , AEP s share of ETT s cumulative revenues, subject to review, is estimated to be   $545 million   based upon interim rate increases received from 2009 through 2016.      During a November 2015 open meeting at the PUCT, ETT committed to file a base rate case by February 2017.  A base rate review could produce a refund if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim increase was based.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring.  A revenue decrease, including a refund of interim transmission rates, could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  I M Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  Indiana Amended PJM Settlement Agreement  
    
  In September 2016, I M and certain intervenors filed an amended settlement agreement with the IURC.  This agreement amends a previously approved 2014 settlement agreement that addresses the recovery of   43.5%   of certain transmission expenses through the Indiana PJM rider through 2017.  
    
  The amended agreement allows I M to recover   100%   of the Indiana jurisdictional share of these transmission expenses not recovered through base rates through the Indiana PJM rider, subject to a   $109 million   cap for the period January 2017 through June 2018.  Beginning July 2018, I M will be allowed to recover   100%   of the Indiana jurisdictional share of these transmission expenses through the Indiana PJM rider, without a cap, until the issue is addressed by the IURC in a future proceeding, subject to the condition that I M files a base rate case on or before January 2018.  The amended agreement also provides for deferral of incremental vegetation management expenses over the period January 2017 through June 2018.  Any vegetation management expenses deferred would reduce the cap for the transmission expenses described above.  As part of the amended settlement, I M agreed that it will not file a base rate case before July 2017 and will not implement new base rates prior to July 2018.  A hearing at the IURC was held in October 2016.  
    
  Rockport Plant, Unit 2 Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) 
    
  In October 2016, I M filed an application with the IURC for approval of a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to install SCR technology at Rockport Plant, Unit 2 by December 2019.  The equipment will allow I M to reduce emissions of NO   x    from Rockport Plant, Unit 2 in order for I M to continue to operate that unit under current environmental requirements. The estimated cost of the SCR project is   $274 million  , excluding AFUDC, to be shared equally between I M and AEGCo.  The filing included a request for authorization for I M to defer its Indiana jurisdictional ownership share of costs including investment carrying costs, depreciation over a 10-year life and other related expenses.  I M proposed recovery of these costs using the existing Clean Coal Technology Rider. The AEGCo ownership share of the proposed SCR project will be billable under the Rockport Unit Power Agreement to affiliates, including I M, with I M s share recoverable in its base rates.  
  KGPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Kingsport Base Rate Case 
    
  In January 2016, KGPCo filed a request with the TRA to increase base rates by   $12 million   annually based upon a proposed return on common equity of   10.66%  .  In August 2016, the TRA approved a settlement agreement that included an   $8 million   annual increase in base rates with a   9.85%   return on common equity effective September 2016.  

133 

OPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and OPCo) 
    
  Ohio Electric Security Plan Filings 
    
  2009   2011 ESP 
    
  The PUCO issued an order in March 2009 that modified and approved the ESP which established rates at the start of the April 2009 billing cycle through 2011.  The order also provided a phase-in FAC, which was authorized to be recovered through a non-bypassable surcharge over the period 2012 through 2018. 
    
  In 2012, the PUCO issued an order in a separate proceeding which implemented a PIRR to recover OPCo s deferred fuel costs in rates beginning September 2012.  The PUCO ruled that carrying charges should be calculated without an offset for accumulated deferred income taxes and that a long-term debt rate should be applied when collections begin.  In November 2012, OPCo appealed that PUCO order to the Supreme Court of Ohio claiming a long-term debt rate modified the previously adjudicated 2009 - 2011 ESP order, which granted a weighted average cost of capital (WACC) rate.  In 2015, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued a decision that reversed the PUCO order on the carrying cost rate issue and remanded the matter back to the PUCO for reinstatement of the WACC rate.  In June 2016, the PUCO approved OPCo s proposed increase to the PIRR rates, in accordance with the Supreme Court of Ohio ruling.  The increase to PIRR rates included   $146 million   in additional carrying charges and the recovery of   $40 million   in additional under-recovered fuel costs resulting from a decrease in customer demand.  The increase is effective July 2016 through December 2018.  In July 2016, intervenors filed requests for rehearing with the PUCO, which the PUCO granted in August 2016. 
    
  If the PUCO determines after rehearing that the additional PIRR carrying charges are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  June 2012   May 2015 ESP Including Capacity Charge  
    
  In August 2012, the PUCO issued an order which adopted and modified a new ESP that established base generation rates through May 2015.  In 2013, this ruling was generally upheld in PUCO rehearing orders. 
    
  In July 2012, the PUCO issued an order in a separate capacity proceeding requiring OPCo to charge CRES providers the RPM price and authorized OPCo to defer a portion of its incurred capacity costs not recovered from CRES providers up to   $188.88  /MW day.  The OPCo RPM price collected from CRES providers, which included reserve margins, was approximately   $34  /MW day through May 2014 and   $150  /MW day from June 2014 through May 2015.  In April 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio issued two opinions related to the deferral of OPCo s capacity charges.  In one of the opinions, the Supreme Court of Ohio ruled that the PUCO must reconsider an energy credit that was used to determine OPCo s authorized capacity deferral threshold of $188.88/MW day during the August 2012 through May 2015 period.  The PUCO reduced OPCo s authorized capacity deferral threshold to $188.88/MW day largely due to an offset for an energy credit of   $147.41  /MW day.  The Supreme Court of Ohio directed the PUCO to substantively address OPCo s arguments that the $147.41/MW day credit was overstated by approximately   $100  /MW day due to various inaccuracies affecting input data and assumptions.  
    
  As part of the August 2012 ESP order, the PUCO established a non-bypassable RSR, effective September 2012.  The RSR was collected from customers at   $3.50  /MWh through May 2014 and at   $4.00  /MWh for the period June 2014 through May 2015, with   $1.00  /MWh applied to the recovery of deferred capacity costs.  In April 2015, the PUCO issued an order that modified and approved OPCo s July 2014 application to collect the unrecovered portion of the deferred capacity costs.  The order included approval to continue the collection of deferred capacity costs at a rate of   $4.00  /MWh beginning June 1, 2015 for approximately   32   months, with carrying costs at a long-term cost of debt rate.  Additionally, the order stated that an audit will be conducted of the May 31, 2015 capacity deferral balance.  As of   September 30, 2016  , OPCo s net deferred capacity costs balance was   $239 million  , including debt carrying costs, was recorded in Regulatory Assets on the balance sheet.  In April 2016, the second Supreme Court of Ohio opinion rejected a portion of OPCo s RSR revenues collected during the period September 2012 through May 2015 and directed the PUCO to reduce OPCo s deferred capacity costs by these previously collected RSR revenues.  The Supreme Court of  
  
   134 

Ohio was not able to determine the amount of the reduction to OPCo s deferred capacity costs and remanded the issue to the PUCO to determine the appropriate reduction.  As directed by the PUCO, in May 2016, OPCo submitted revised RSR tariffs that reflect the RSR being collected subject to refund. 
    
  In April 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio also ruled favorably on OPCo s cross-appeal regarding a previously PUCO-imposed SEET threshold under the ESP and remanded this issue to the PUCO.  See  Significantly Excessive Earnings Test Filings  section below.   
    
  In 2013, the PUCO issued its Orders on Rehearing for the ESP which generally upheld its August 2012 order.  The PUCO clarified that a final reconciliation of revenues and expenses would be permitted for any over- or under-recovery on several riders including fuel.  In November 2013, the PUCO issued an order approving OPCo s competitive bid process with modifications.  Additionally, the PUCO ordered that intervenor concerns related to the recovery of the fixed fuel costs through potentially both the FAC and the approved capacity charges be addressed in subsequent FAC proceedings.  
    
  In January 2014, the PUCO denied all rehearing requests and agreed to issue a supplemental request for an independent auditor in the 2012 - 2013 FAC proceeding to separately examine the recovery of the fixed fuel costs, including OVEC.  In March 2014, the PUCO approved OPCo s request to implement riders related to the unbundling of the FAC.  In October 2014, the independent auditor, selected by the PUCO, filed its report with the PUCO for the period August 2012 through May 2015.  If the PUCO ultimately concludes that a portion of the fixed fuel costs are also recovered through OPCo s   $188.88  /MW day capacity charge, the independent auditor has recommended a methodology for calculating a refund of a portion of certain fixed fuel costs.  The retail share of these fixed fuel costs is approximately   $90 million   annually.  Management believes that no over-recovery of costs has occurred and disagrees with the findings in the audit report. 
    
  In June 2016, OPCo filed a request with the PUCO that requested a consolidated procedural schedule to resolve interrelated proceedings including (a) OPCo s deferral of capacity costs for the period August 2012 through May 2015, (b) the implementation of OPCo s RSR and (c) the concerns related to the recovery of fixed fuel costs through both the FAC and the approved capacity charges.  As part of the filing, OPCo requested that its net deferred capacity costs balance as of May 31, 2015 increase by   $157 million  , including carrying charges through September 2016.  This net increase consists of a   $327 million   decrease due to the non-deferral portion of the RSR collections and an increase of   $484 million   for the correction of the energy credit.  Recovery of the $157 million was requested to be effective October 2016 through December 2018.  Additionally, OPCo filed testimony supporting the position that double recovery of fixed fuel costs could not have occurred because OPCo was unable to fully recover its capacity costs, which included fixed fuel costs, even with a corrected energy credit.   
    
  Due to the interrelated nature of the two Supreme Court of Ohio opinions that directly relate to OPCo s deferred capacity costs, management believes that the PUCO will rule upon these issues together.  Further, management believes that the net impact of these issues will not result in a material future reduction of OPCo s net income.  The recovery of fixed fuel costs will be addressed in a separate hearing scheduled for January 2017.  See  2012 and 2013 Fuel Adjustment Clause Audits  section below.   
    
  If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect all components of its ESP rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  June 2015 - May 2018 ESP Including PPA Application and Proposed ESP Extension through 2024 
    
  In 2013, OPCo filed an application with the PUCO to approve an ESP that included proposed rate adjustments and the continuation and modification of certain existing riders, including the Distribution Investment Rider (DIR), effective June 2015 through May 2018.  The proposal also included a PPA rider that would allow retail customers to receive a rate stabilizing charge or credit by hedging market-based prices with a cost-based PPA.  The PPA would initially be based upon the OVEC contractual entitlement and could, upon further approval, be expanded to include other contracts involving other Ohio legacy generation assets. 
  
   135 

In February 2015, the PUCO issued an order approving OPCo s ESP application, subject to certain modifications, with a return on common equity of   10.2%   on capital costs for certain riders.  The order included (a) approval of the DIR, with modified rate caps established by the PUCO, (b) authorization to establish a zero rate rider for OPCo s proposed PPA, (c) the option for OPCo to reapply in a future proceeding with a more detailed PPA proposal and (d) a directive to continue to pursue the transfer of the OVEC contractual entitlement to AGR or to otherwise divest of its interest in OVEC.  In May 2015, the PUCO issued an order on rehearing that increased the DIR rate caps and deferred ruling on all requests for rehearing related to the establishment of the PPA rider.  In July 2015, the PUCO granted OPCo s and various intervenors  requests for rehearing related to the May 2015 order.  
    
  In May 2015, OPCo filed an amended PPA application that (a) included OPCo s OVEC contractual entitlement (OVEC PPA), (b) addressed the PPA requirements set forth in the PUCO s February 2015 order and (c) included the 2,671 MW to be available for capacity, energy and ancillary services, produced by AGR over the lives of the respective generating units (Affiliate PPA).  
    
  In March 2016, a contested stipulation agreement related to the PPA rider application was modified and approved by the PUCO.  The approved PPA rider is effective April 2016 through May 2024, subject to audit and review by the PUCO.  The stipulation agreement, as approved, included (a) an Affiliate PPA between OPCo and AGR to be included in the PPA rider, (b) OPCo s OVEC PPA to be included in the PPA rider, (c) potential additional contingent customer credits of up to   $100 million   to be included in the PPA rider over the final four years of the PPA rider and (d) the limitation that OPCo will not flow through any capacity performance penalties or bonuses through the PPA rider.  Additionally, subject to cost recovery and PUCO approval, OPCo agreed to develop and implement, by 2021, a solar energy project(s) of at least   400   MW and a wind energy project(s) of at least   500   MW, with   100%   of all output to be received by OPCo.  AEP affiliates could own up to   50%   of these solar and wind projects.  OPCo agreed to file a carbon reduction plan with the PUCO by December 2016 that will focus on fuel diversification and carbon emission reductions.   
    
  In March 2016, a group of merchant generation owners filed a complaint at the FERC against PJM seeking revisions to the Minimum Offer Price Rule (MOPR) in PJM s tariff.  Although the complaint requested the FERC act in advance of the May 2016 Base Residual Auction for the 2019/2020 delivery year, the complaint is still pending without a decision from the FERC.  If approved as proposed, the revised MOPR could affect future bidding behavior for units with cost recovery mechanisms.  
    
  In April 2016, the FERC issued an order granting a January 2016 complaint filed against AGR and OPCo.  The FERC order rescinded the waivers of the FERC s affiliate rules as to the affiliate PPA between AGR and OPCo.  As a result, AGR and OPCo cannot implement the affiliate PPA without the FERC review, in accordance with FERC s rules governing affiliate transactions.  As a result of the April 2016 FERC order, management does not intend to pursue the affiliate PPA. 
    
  In May 2016, OPCo filed an application for rehearing with the PUCO related to certain aspects of the March 2016 PUCO order.  The application included a proposed OVEC-only PPA Rider that included an option for the rider to be bypassable.  The proposed OVEC-only PPA Rider included (a) the elimination of the PUCO-imposed customer-specific rate impact cap of   5%   through May 2018, (b) modifications to proportionately decrease the amount of the potential customer credits and (c) the inclusion of PJM capacity performance penalties within the PPA rider.  Also in May 2016, intervenors filed applications for rehearing with the PUCO opposing the modified and approved stipulation agreement. 
    
  OPCo has the option to exercise its right to withdraw from the PPA stipulation if the PUCO does not accept the requested modifications. 
    
  Consistent with the terms of the modified and approved stipulation agreement, in May 2016, OPCo filed an amended ESP that proposed to extend the ESP through May 2024.  The amended ESP included (a) an extension of the PPA rider, which includes only OPCo s entitlements to its ownership percentage of OVEC, (b) a proposed   10.41%   return on common equity on capital costs for certain riders, (c) the continuation of riders previously approved in the June 2015 - May 2018 ESP, (d) proposed increases in rate caps related to OPCo s DIR and (e) the addition of various new riders, including a Generation Resource Rider.  Based upon a September 2016 PUCO order, OPCo will refile its ESP extension application and supporting testimony in November 2016. 

136 

If OPCo is ultimately not permitted to fully collect all components of its ESP rates, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Significantly Excessive Earnings Test Filings 
    
  Background 
    
  Ohio law provides for the return of significantly excessive earnings to ratepayers upon PUCO review.  Significantly excessive earnings are measured by whether the earned return on common equity of the electric distribution utility is significantly in excess of the return on common equity that was earned during the same period by publicly traded companies, including utilities, that face comparable business and financial risk.   
    
  2009 SEET Filing 
    
  In 2011, the PUCO issued an order on the 2009 SEET filing.  The order gave consideration for a future commitment to invest   $20 million   to support the development of a large solar farm.  In 2013, the PUCO found there was not a need for the large solar farm.  The PUCO noted that OPCo remains obligated to spend   $20 million   on this solar project or another project.   
    
  In September 2013, a proposed second phase of OPCo s   gridSMART        (  gridSMART        Phase II) program was filed with the PUCO which included a proposed project to satisfy the PUCO 2009 SEET directive.  In April 2016, a stipulation agreement related to the   gridSMART        Phase II program was filed with the PUCO.  As part of the stipulation agreement, OPCo will invest at least   $20 million   over a six-year period for the installation of Volt VAR Optimization (VVO) technology on selected circuits throughout OPCo s service territory.   All parties to the stipulation agree that OPCo s proposed VVO investment resolves OPCo s outstanding obligation for renewable or similar investment associated with the PUCO s 2009 SEET directive.  A hearing at the PUCO on the stipulation was held in August 2016.  A decision from the PUCO is pending.  
    
  2014 and 2015 SEET Filing 
    
  The PUCO established an annual SEET earnings threshold of   12%   during the June 2012 - May 2015 ESP period.  In May 2013, OPCo filed a cross appeal with the Supreme Court of Ohio, asserting that the SEET threshold would not be based on the earnings of comparable publicly traded companies as originally required by the SEET statute.   
    
  In April 2016, the Supreme Court of Ohio agreed with OPCo s cross-appeal assertion that a 12% SEET threshold was not based on the applicable Ohio SEET statute.   The Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the   12%   threshold and remanded this issue to the PUCO.  A decision from the PUCO is pending.   
    
  In June 2015 and May 2016, OPCo submitted its SEET filings for 2014 and 2015, respectively, with the PUCO.  In August 2016, intervenors filed testimony recommending a revenue refund of approximately   $20 million   for 2014 and no refund for 2015 based upon a new approach to determine significantly excessive earnings that has not been previously approved by the PUCO.  In September 2016, OPCo and the PUCO staff filed a stipulation agreement with the PUCO stating that no significantly excessive earnings occurred for 2014 or 2015.  In September 2016, intervenors filed testimony opposing the stipulation agreement.  Management believes its financial statements adequately address the impact of 2014 and 2015 SEET requirements.   
    
  2009 Fuel Adjustment Clause Audit 
    
  In January 2012, the PUCO issued an order in OPCo s 2009 FAC that the remaining   $65 million   in proceeds from a 2008 coal contract settlement agreement be applied against OPCo s under-recovered fuel balance.  In April 2012, on rehearing, the PUCO ordered that the settlement credit only needed to reflect the Ohio retail jurisdictional share of the gain not already flowed through the FAC with carrying charges.  As a result, OPCo recorded a   $30 million   net favorable adjustment on the statement of income in 2012.  The January 2012 PUCO order also stated that a consultant should be hired to review the coal reserve valuation and recommend whether any additional value should benefit ratepayers.

In September 2014, the Supreme Court of Ohio upheld the PUCO order on appeal.  A review of the coal reserve valuation by an outside consultant has not been initiated by the PUCO.  If the PUCO ultimately determines that additional amounts should benefit ratepayers as a result of the consultant s review of the coal reserve valuation, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  2012 and 2013 Fuel Adjustment Clause Audits 
    
  In May 2014, the PUCO-selected outside consultant provided its final report related to its 2012 and 2013 FAC audit which included certain unfavorable recommendations related to the FAC recovery for 2012 and 2013.  These recommendations are opposed by OPCo.  In addition, the PUCO will consider the results of the final audit of the recovery of fixed fuel costs that was issued in October 2014.  See the  June 2012 - May 2015 ESP Including Capacity Charge  section above.  
    
  A hearing at the PUCO is scheduled for January 2017 to jointly review the recovery of fixed fuel costs as well as the open FAC audits discussed above.  If the PUCO orders a reduction to the FAC deferral or a refund to customers, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Ormet 
    
  Ormet, a large aluminum company, had a contract to purchase power from OPCo.  In OPCo s 2009 - 2011 ESP proceeding, intervenors requested that OPCo be required to refund the Ormet-related revenues under a previous interim arrangement (effective from January 2009 through September 2009) and requested that the PUCO prevent OPCo from collecting Ormet-related revenues.  Through September 2009, the last month of the interim arrangement, OPCo had approximately   $64 million   of deferred FAC costs related to the interim arrangement, excluding   $2 million   of unrecognized equity carrying costs.  The PUCO did not take any action on this request.  The intervenors raised this issue again in response to OPCo s filing to approve recovery of the deferral under the interim agreement.  Of the $64 million in deferred FAC costs, approximately   50%   was related to Columbus Southern Power Company (CSPCo) and   50%   related to OPCo, prior to the merger of CSPCo into OPCo in December 2011.  CSPCo s portion of these deferred fuel costs has been recovered as a result of the previous collections of CSPCo fuel costs from ratepayers and the PUCO s 2013 order to apply CSPCo s 2010 excessive earnings to offset CSPCo s final deferred fuel balance.  OPCo s share of Ormet deferred fuel costs continues to be recovered through OPCo s PIRR.   
    
  To the extent amounts discussed above are refunded to customers, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  PSO Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and PSO) 
    
  2015 Oklahoma Base Rate Case 
    
  In July 2015, PSO filed a request with the OCC to increase annual revenues by   $137 million   to recover costs associated with its environmental compliance plan for the Federal EPA s Regional Haze Rule and Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, and to recover investments and other costs that have increased since the last base rate case.  The annual increase consists of (a) a base rate increase of   $89 million  , which includes   $48 million   in increased depreciation expense that reflects, among other things, recovery through June 2026 of Northeastern Plant, Units 3 and 4, (b) a rider or base rate increase of   $44 million   to recover costs for the environmental controls being installed on Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 and the Comanche Plant and (c) a request to include environmental consumable costs in the FAC, estimated to be   $4 million   annually.  The rate increase includes a proposed return on common equity of   10.5%   effective in January 2016.  The proposed   $44 million   increase related to environmental investments was effective in March 2016, after the Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 environmental controls were placed in service.  The total estimated cost of the environmental controls to be installed at Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 and the Comanche Plant is   $219 million  , excluding AFUDC.  As of   September 30, 2016  , PSO had incurred costs of   $180 million   and   $43 million  , including AFUDC, for Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 and Comanche Plant, respectively. 

138 

In addition, the filing also notified the OCC that the incremental replacement capacity and energy costs, including the first year effects of new PPAs, estimated to be   $35 million  , will be incurred related to the environmental compliance plan due to the closure of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, which would be recovered through the FAC.  In April 2016, Northeastern Plant, Unit 4 was retired.  Upon retirement,   $87 million   was reclassified as Regulatory Assets on the balance sheet related to the net book value of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4.  These regulatory assets are pending regulatory approval. 
    
  In October 2015, testimony was filed by OCC staff and intervenors with recommendations that included increases to base rates and/or the proposed environmental rider ranging from   $10 million   to   $31 million  , based upon returns on common equity ranging from   8.75%   to   9.3%  , and increases to depreciation expense ranging from   $23 million   to   $46 million  .  Additionally, recommendations by certain intervenors included (a) no recovery of PSO s investment in Northeastern Plant, Unit 3 environmental controls, (b) no recovery of the plant balances at the time the units are retired in 2016 and 2026, (c) denial of returns on the book values after the retirement dates, or to be set at only the cost of debt, and (d) the disallowance of the capacity costs associated with the PPAs.  Additionally, some intervenors recommended no change in depreciation lives for Northeastern Plant, Units 3 and 4.  These units are currently being depreciated through 2040.  Hearings at the OCC were held in December 2015.  In January 2016, PSO implemented an interim annual base rate increase of   $75 million  .  These interim rates are subject to refund pending a final order from the OCC related to the initial   $137 million   request.  
    
  In June 2016, an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) issued a report related to PSO s base rate case filing and subsequently provided an additional supplemental report in August 2016.  The ALJ recommended a   9.25%   return on common equity.  The ALJ found that PSO s environmental compliance plan is prudent and provided for cost recovery of the investment in this case with a recommended investment cap of   $210 million   on environmental controls installed at Northeastern Plant, Unit 3.   Additionally, the ALJ recommendations included (a) a   $14 million   increase in depreciation  expense, (b)  continued depreciation of Northeastern Plant, Units 3 and 4 through 2040 (no accelerated depreciation), (c) return of, but no return on, the remaining net book value of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, (d) elimination of the rider to recover advanced metering starting in December 2016, without inclusion in base rates and (e) elimination of the system reliability rider through consolidation in base rates, without addressing a transition for recovery of rider costs, including deferred costs.  The estimated annual revenue increase resulting from the ALJ recommendations is approximately   $47 million  .   
    
  In June and September 2016, PSO, the OCC staff, the Attorney General and intervenors filed exceptions to the ALJ reports.  PSO s response included numerous exceptions related to the ALJ recommendations including the lack of a return on the net book value of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4.  The OCC staff filed exceptions that supported the full recovery of Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, including a return, and recommended a   $32 million   increase in annual revenues.  An order from the OCC is anticipated in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
    
  If any of these costs, including a return on Northeastern Plant, Unit 4, are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  SWEPCo Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
    
  2012 Texas Base Rate Case 
    
  In 2012, SWEPCo filed a request with the PUCT to increase annual base rates primarily due to the completion of the Turk Plant.  In 2013, the PUCT issued an order affirming the prudence of the Turk Plant but determined that the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap established in a previous Certificate of Convenience and Necessity case also limited SWEPCo s recovery of AFUDC in addition to limits on its recovery of cash construction costs.  Additionally, the PUCT deferred consideration of the requested increase in depreciation expense related to the change in the 2016 retirement date of the Welsh Plant, Unit 2.   

139 

Upon rehearing in 2014, the PUCT reversed its initial ruling and determined that AFUDC was excluded from the Turk Plant s Texas jurisdictional capital cost cap.  As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2013, SWEPCo reversed   $114 million   of previously recorded regulatory disallowances.  The resulting annual base rate increase was approximately   $52 million  .  In May 2014, intervenors filed appeals of that order with the Texas District Court.  In June 2014, SWEPCo intervened in those appeals.  A hearing at the Texas District Court is scheduled for March 2017. 
    
  If certain parts of the PUCT order are overturned or if SWEPCo cannot ultimately recover its Texas jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant investment, including AFUDC, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  2012 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In 2012, SWEPCo initiated a proceeding to establish new formula base rates in Louisiana, including recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share (approximately   29%  ) of the Turk Plant.  In February 2013, a settlement was approved by the LPSC.  The settlement increased SWEPCo s Louisiana total rates by approximately   $2 million   annually, effective March 2013, which consisted of an increase in base rates of approximately   $85 million   annually offset by a decrease in fuel and other rates of approximately   $83 million   annually.  The March 2013 base rates are based upon a   10%   return on common equity and cost recovery of the Louisiana jurisdictional share of the Turk Plant and Stall Unit.  The rates are subject to refund based on the prudence review of the Turk Plant.  The settlement also provided that the LPSC would review base rates in 2014 and 2015 and that SWEPCo would recover non-fuel Turk Plant costs and a full weighted-average cost of capital return on the prudently incurred Turk Plant investment in jurisdictional rate base, effective January 2013.  In December 2014, the LPSC approved a settlement agreement related to the staff review of the cost of service.  The settlement agreement reduced the requested revenue increase by   $3 million  , primarily due to the timing of both the allowed recovery of certain existing regulatory assets and the establishment of a regulatory asset for certain previously expensed costs.  A hearing at the LPSC related to the Turk Plant prudence review is scheduled for March 2017.  If the LPSC orders refunds based upon the pending prudence review of the Turk Plant investment, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.  
    
  2014 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In 2014, SWEPCo filed its annual formula rate plan for test year 2013 with the LPSC.  The filing included a   $5 million   annual increase, which was effective August 2014.  SWEPCo also proposed to increase rates by an additional   $15 million   annually, effective January 2015, for a total annual increase of   $20 million  .  This additional increase reflects the cost of incremental generation used to serve Louisiana customers in 2015 due to the expiration of a purchased power agreement attributable to Louisiana customers.  In December 2014, the LPSC approved a partial settlement agreement that included the implementation of the   $15 million   annual increase in rates effective January 2015, subject to staff review of the cost of service and prudence review of the Turk Plant.  In July 2016, the LPSC approved a settlement agreement related to the staff review of the cost of service.  A portion of the rates remain subject to refund based on the prudence review of the Turk Plant, see  2012 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing  above.  Management believes its financial statements adequately address the impact of this settlement agreement.  If the LPSC orders refunds based upon the pending prudence review of the Turk Plant investment, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  2015 Louisiana Formula Rate Filing 
    
  In April 2015, SWEPCo filed its formula rate plan for test year 2014 with the LPSC.  The filing included a   $14 million   annual increase, which was effective August 2015.  This increase is subject to LPSC staff review and is subject to refund.   If any of these costs are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition.

Welsh Plant - Environmental Impact 
    
  Management currently estimates that the investment necessary to meet proposed environmental regulations through 2025 for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 could cost approximately   $850 million  ,   excluding AFUDC.  As of   September 30, 2016  , SWEPCo had incurred costs of   $395 million  , including AFUDC, and had remaining contractual construction obligations of   $14 million   related to these projects.  As part of this investment, in 2016 SWEPCo completed construction of environmental control projects to meet Mercury and Air Toxics Standards for Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 at a cost of approximately   $370 million  , excluding AFUDC.  Management continues to evaluate the impact of environmental rules and related project cost estimates.  In March 2016, SWEPCo filed a request with the APSC to recover   $69 million   in environmental costs related to the Arkansas retail jurisdictional share of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3, which was approved by the APSC in August 2016.  SWEPCo began recovering the Arkansas jurisdictional share of these costs in March 2016, subject to review in the next filed base rate proceeding.  In September 2016, SWEPCo filed an additional request to increase the Arkansas retail jurisdictional share of the environmental investment by   $10 million  , for a total of   $79 million  .  SWEPCo implemented the increase in September 2016.  SWEPCo will seek recovery of the remaining project costs from customers at the state commissions and the FERC.    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the net book value of Welsh Plant, Units 1 and 3 was   $632 million  , before cost of removal, including materials and supplies inventory and CWIP.  In April 2016, Welsh Plant, Unit 2 was retired.  Upon retirement,   $76 million   was reclassified as Regulatory Assets on the balance sheet related to the net book value of Welsh Plant, Unit 2 and the related asset retirement obligation costs.  Management will seek recovery of the remaining regulatory assets in future rate proceedings. 
    
  If any of these costs are not recoverable, including retirement-related costs for Welsh Plant, Unit 2, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  TCC Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP)  
    
  TCC Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) 
    
  In July 2016, the PUCT approved a settlement agreement between TCC and intervenors related to TCC s request for a DCRF rider to allow recovery of eligible net distribution investments.  The settlement agreement included an annual revenue requirement of   $45 million  , effective September 2016.  Amounts approved are subject to refund based upon a prudence review of the investments in TCC s next base rate case.   
    
  TNC Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP)  
    
  TNC Distribution Cost Recovery Factor (DCRF) 
    
  In July 2016, the PUCT approved a settlement agreement between TNC and intervenors related to TNC s request for a DCRF rider to allow recovery of eligible net distribution investments.  The settlement agreement included an annual revenue requirement of   $11 million  , effective September 2016.  Amounts approved are subject to refund based upon a prudence review of the investments in TNC s next base rate case.   
    
  FERC Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP, APCo, I M and OPCo) 
    
  PJM Transmission Rates 
    
  In June 2016, PJM transmission owners, including the AEP East Companies, and various state commissions filed a settlement agreement with the FERC to resolve outstanding issues related to cost responsibility for charges to transmission customers for certain transmission facilities that operate at or above 500 kV.  In July 2016, certain parties filed comments at the FERC contesting the settlement agreement.  Upon final FERC approval, PJM would implement a transmission enhancement charge adjustment through the PJM OATT, billable through 2025.  Management expects that any refunds received would generally be returned to retail customers through existing state rider mechanisms.  

141 

FERC Transmission Complaint 
    
  In October 2016, several parties filed a joint complaint with the FERC that states the base return on common equity used by various AEP affiliates in calculating formula transmission rates under the PJM Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) is excessive and should be reduced from   10.99%   to   8.32%  , effective upon the date of the complaint.  Management is reviewing the filing and evaluating a response to the complaint.  If the FERC orders revenue reductions, including refunds from the date of filing, it could reduce future net income and cash flows and impact financial condition. 
    
  Other Rate Matters   (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  SPP Open Access Transmission Tariff (OATT) Upgrade Costs 
    
  Under the SPP OATT, costs of sponsor-funded transmission upgrades may be recovered, in part, from SPP customers whose transmission service is dependent upon capacity enabled by the upgrades.  SPP has not charged its customers any amounts attributable to these upgrades.  Based upon preliminary information provided by SPP, in the third quarter of 2016, PSO and SWEPCo recognized a net unfavorable impact of   $3 million   and   $4 million  , respectively, related to the OATT upgrade costs.  SPP expects to finalize the amounts due in the fourth quarter of 2016.

5  .    COMMITMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  The Registrants are subject to certain claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business.  In addition, the Registrants  business activities are subject to extensive governmental regulation related to public health and the environment.  The ultimate outcome of such pending or potential litigation against the Registrants cannot be predicted.  Management accrues contingent liabilities only when management concludes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated.  When management determines that it is not probable, but rather reasonably possible that a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements, management discloses such contingencies and the possible loss or range of loss if such estimate can be made.  Any estimated range is based on currently available information and involves elements of judgment and significant uncertainties.  Any estimated range of possible loss may not represent the maximum possible loss exposure.  Circumstances change over time and actual results may vary significantly from estimates.   
    
  For current proceedings not specifically discussed below, management does not anticipate that the liabilities, if any, arising from such proceedings would have a material effect on the financial statements.  The Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies note within the   2015   Annual Report should be read in conjunction with this report. 
    
  GUARANTEES 
    
  Liabilities for guarantees are recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Guarantees.   There is no collateral held in relation to any guarantees unless specified below.  In the event any guarantee is drawn, there is no recourse to third parties unless specified below. 
    
  Letters of Credit (Applies to AEP, APCo, I M and OPCo) 
    
  Standby letters of credit are entered into with third parties.  These letters of credit are issued in the ordinary course of business and cover items such as natural gas and electricity risk management contracts, construction contracts, insurance programs, security deposits and debt service reserves. 
    
  AEP has   two   revolving credit facilities totaling   $3.5 billion  .  In June 2016, the   $1.75 billion   credit facility due in June 2017 was amended to   $3 billion   due in June 2021, under which up to   $1.2 billion   may be issued as letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries.  Also in June 2016, the   $1.75 billion   credit facility due in July 2018 was amended to   $500 million   due in June 2018.  As of   September 30, 2016  , no letters of credit were issued under the $3 billion revolving credit facility. 
    
  An uncommitted facility gives the issuer of the facility the right to accept or decline each request made under the facility.  AEP also issues letters of credit on behalf of subsidiaries under four uncommitted facilities totaling   $300 million  .   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Registrants  maximum future payments for letters of credit issued under the uncommitted facilities were as follows:  

The Registrants have $291 million of variable rate Pollution Control Bonds supported by $295 million of bilateral letters of credit as follows: 

143 

Guarantees of Third-Party Obligations (Applies to AEP and SWEPCo) 
    
  As part of the process to receive a renewal of a Texas Railroad Commission permit for lignite mining, SWEPCo provides guarantees of mine reclamation of   $115 million  .  Since SWEPCo uses self-bonding, the guarantee provides for SWEPCo to commit to use its resources to complete the reclamation in the event the work is not completed by Sabine.  This guarantee ends upon depletion of reserves and completion of final reclamation.  Based on the latest study completed in 2010, it is estimated the reserves will be depleted in 2036 with final reclamation completed by 2046 at an estimated cost of   $58 million  .  Actual reclamation costs could vary due to period inflation and any changes to actual mine reclamation.  As of   September 30, 2016  , SWEPCo has collected   $68 million   through a rider for final mine closure and reclamation costs, of which   $15 million   is recorded in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities and   $53 million   is recorded in Asset Retirement Obligations on SWEPCo s balance sheets. 
    
  Sabine charges SWEPCo, its only customer, all of its costs.  SWEPCo passes these costs to customers through its fuel clause. 
    
  Indemnifications and Other Guarantees 
    
  Contracts 
    
  The Registrants enter into certain types of contracts which require indemnifications.  Typically these contracts include, but are not limited to, sale agreements, lease agreements, purchase agreements and financing agreements.  Generally, these agreements may include, but are not limited to, indemnifications around certain tax, contractual and environmental matters.  With respect to sale agreements, exposure generally does not exceed the sale price.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no material liabilities recorded for any indemnifications. 
    
  APCo, I M and OPCo are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted by AEPSC on behalf of AEP companies related to power purchase and sale activity.  PSO and SWEPCo are jointly and severally liable for activity conducted by AEPSC on behalf of PSO and SWEPCo related to power purchase and sale activity. 
    
  Master Lease Agreements 
    
  The Registrants lease certain equipment under master lease agreements.  Under the lease agreements, the lessor is guaranteed a residual value up to a stated percentage of either the unamortized balance or the equipment cost at the end of the lease term.  If the actual fair value of the leased equipment is below the guaranteed residual value at the end of the lease term, the Registrants are committed to pay the difference between the actual fair value and the residual value guarantee.  Historically, at the end of the lease term the fair value has been in excess of the unamortized balance.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum potential loss by Registrants for these lease agreements assuming the fair value of the equipment is zero at the end of the lease term is as follows: 

144 

Railcar Lease (Applies to AEP, I M and SWEPCo) 
    
  In June 2003, AEP Transportation LLC (AEP Transportation), a subsidiary of AEP, entered into an agreement with BTM Capital Corporation, as lessor, to lease   875   coal-transporting aluminum railcars.  The lease is accounted for as an operating lease.  In January 2008, AEP Transportation assigned the remaining   848   railcars under the original lease agreement to I M (  390   railcars) and SWEPCo (  458   railcars).  The assignments are accounted for as operating leases for I M and SWEPCo.  The initial lease term was   five   years with   three   consecutive five-year renewal periods for a maximum lease term of   twenty   years.  I M and SWEPCo intend to renew these leases for the full lease term of   twenty   years via the renewal options.  The future minimum lease obligations are   $9 million   and   $11 million   for I M and SWEPCo, respectively, for the remaining railcars as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Under the lease agreement, the lessor is guaranteed that the sale proceeds under a return-and-sale option will equal at least a lessee obligation amount specified in the lease, which declines from   83%   of the projected fair value of the equipment under the current   five  -year lease term to   77%   at the end of the   20  -year term.  I M and SWEPCo have assumed the guarantee under the return-and-sale option.  The maximum potential losses related to the guarantee are   $9 million   and   $10 million   for I M and SWEPCo, respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  , assuming the fair value of the equipment is   zero   at the end of the current   five  -year lease term.  However, management believes that the fair value would produce a sufficient sales price to avoid any loss. 
    
  AEPRO Boat and Barge Leases (Applies to AEP) 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in November 2015.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other Segment)  section of Note   6  .  Certain of the boat and barge leases acquired by the nonaffiliated party are subject to an AEP guarantee in favor of the lessor, ensuring future payments under such leases with maturities up to 2027.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum potential amount of future payments required under the guaranteed leases was   $87 million  .  In certain instances, AEP has no recourse against the nonaffiliated party if required to pay a lessor under a guarantee, but AEP would have access to sell the leased assets in order to recover payments made by AEP under the guarantee.  As of   September 30, 2016  , AEP s boat and barge lease guarantee liability was   $14 million  , of which   $3 million   was recorded in Other Current Liabilities and   $11 million   was recorded in Deferred Credits and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on AEP s balance sheets. 
    
  ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES  
    
  The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation 
    
  By-products from the generation of electricity include materials such as ash, slag, sludge, low-level radioactive waste and SNF.  Coal combustion by-products, which constitute the overwhelming percentage of these materials, are typically treated and deposited in captive disposal facilities or are beneficially utilized.  In addition, the generation plants and transmission and distribution facilities have used asbestos, polychlorinated biphenyls and other hazardous and nonhazardous materials.  The Registrants currently incur costs to dispose of these substances safely. 
    
  In 2008, I M received a letter from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) concerning conditions at a site under state law and requesting I M take voluntary action necessary to prevent and/or mitigate public harm.  I M started remediation work in accordance with a plan approved by MDEQ.  In 2014, I M recorded an accrual for remediation at certain additional sites in Michigan.  As a result of receiving approval of completed remediation work from the MDEQ in March 2015, I M s accrual was reduced.  As of   September 30, 2016  , I M s accrual for all of these sites is   $8 million  .  As the remediation work is completed, I M s cost may change as new information becomes available concerning either the level of contamination at the sites or changes in the scope of remediation.  Management cannot predict the amount of additional cost, if any. 

145 

NUCLEAR CONTINGENCIES (APPLIES TO AEP AND I M) 
    
  I M owns and operates the two-unit 2,191 MW Cook Plant under licenses granted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  I M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of SNF and to safely decommission and decontaminate the plant.  The licenses to operate the two nuclear units at the Cook Plant expire in 2034 and 2037.  The operation of a nuclear facility also involves special risks, potential liabilities and specific regulatory and safety requirements.  By agreement, I M is partially liable, together with all other electric utility companies that own nuclear generation units, for a nuclear power plant incident at any nuclear plant in the U.S.  Should a nuclear incident occur at any nuclear power plant in the U.S., the resultant liability could be substantial. 
    
  OPERATIONAL CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Rockport Plant Litigation (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  In July 2013, the Wilmington Trust Company filed a complaint in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AEGCo and I M alleging that it will be unlawfully burdened by the terms of the modified NSR consent decree after the Rockport Plant, Unit 2 lease expiration in December 2022.  The terms of the consent decree allow the installation of environmental emission control equipment, repowering or retirement of the unit.  The plaintiff further alleges that the defendants  actions constitute breach of the lease and participation agreement.  The plaintiff seeks a judgment declaring that the defendants breached the lease, must satisfy obligations related to installation of emission control equipment and indemnify the plaintiff.  The New York court granted a motion to transfer this case to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  In October 2013, a motion to dismiss the case was filed on behalf of AEGCo and I M.  In January 2015, the court issued an opinion and order granting the motion in part and denying the motion in part.  The court dismissed certain of the plaintiff s claims.  Several claims remained, including the claim for breach of the participation agreement and a claim alleging breach of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  In June 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion for partial judgment on the claims seeking dismissal of the breach of participation agreement claim as well as any claim for indemnification of costs associated with this case.  The plaintiff subsequently filed an amended complaint to add another claim under the lease and also filed a motion for partial summary judgment.  In November 2015, AEGCo and I M filed a motion to strike the plaintiff s motion for partial judgment and filed a motion to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim.  In March 2016, the court entered an opinion and order in favor of AEGCo and I M, dismissing certain of the plaintiffs  claims for breach of contract and dismissing claims for breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and further dismissing plaintiffs  claim for indemnification of costs.  By the same order, the court permitted plaintiffs to move forward with their claim that AEGCo and I M failed to exercise prudent utility practices in the maintenance and operation of Rockport Plant, Unit 2.  In April 2016, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal of all remaining claims with prejudice and the court subsequently entered a final judgment.  In May 2016, Plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal on whether AEGCo and I M are in breach of certain contract provisions that Plaintiffs allege operate to protect the Plaintiffs  residual interests in the unit and whether the trial court erred in dismissing Plaintiffs  claims that AEGCo and I M breached the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.  This matter is currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring. 
    
  Natural Gas Markets Lawsuits (Applies to AEP) 
    
  In 2002, the Lieutenant Governor of California filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles County California Superior Court against numerous energy companies, including AEP, alleging violations of California law through alleged fraudulent reporting of false natural gas price and volume information with an intent to affect the market price of natural gas and electricity.  AEP was dismissed from the case.  A number of similar cases were also filed in California and in state and federal courts in several states making essentially the same allegations under federal or state laws against the same companies.  AEP (or a subsidiary) is among the companies named as defendants in some of these cases.  AEP settled, received summary judgment or was dismissed from all of these cases.  The plaintiffs appealed the Nevada federal district court s dismissal of several cases involving AEP companies to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  In April 2013, the appellate court reversed in part, and affirmed in part, the district court s orders in these cases.  The appellate court reversed the district court s holding that the state antitrust claims were preempted by the Natural Gas  
  
   146 

Act and the order dismissing AEP from two of the cases on personal jurisdiction grounds and affirmed the decision denying leave to the plaintiffs to amend their complaints in two of the cases.  Defendants in these cases, including AEP, filed a petition seeking further review with the U.S. Supreme Court on the preemption issue.  AEP also subsequently filed a separate petition with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the personal jurisdiction issue.  In July 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the defendants  previously filed petition for further review with the U.S. Supreme Court on the preemption issue.  Oral argument occurred in January 2015.  In April 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed the judgment of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on the preemption issue, holding that the plaintiffs  state antitrust claims were not preempted by the Natural Gas Act.  The U.S. Supreme Court denied AEP s petition for review of the personal jurisdiction issue shortly thereafter.  The cases were remanded to the district court for further proceedings.  There are four pending cases, of which three are class actions and one is a single plaintiff case.  A tentative settlement has been reached in the three class actions.  This settlement, once finalized, will be subject to court approval.  In May 2016, the district court dismissed the remaining case.  Management will continue to defend any appeal of that matter.  Management is unable to determine the amount of potential additional loss that is reasonably possible of occurring. 
    
  Wage and Hours Lawsuit (Applies to AEP and PSO) 
    
  In August 2013, PSO received an amended complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma by 36 current and former line and warehouse employees alleging that they were denied overtime pay in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act.  Plaintiffs claim that they are entitled to overtime pay for  on call  time.  They allege that restrictions placed on them during on call hours are burdensome enough that they are entitled to compensation for these hours as hours worked.  Plaintiffs also filed a motion to conditionally certify this action as a class action, claiming there are an additional 70 individuals similarly situated to plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs seek damages in the amount of unpaid overtime over a three-year period and liquidated damages in the same amount. 
    
  In March 2014, the federal court granted plaintiffs  motion to conditionally certify the action as a class action.  Notice was given to all potential class members and an additional 44 individuals opted in to the class, bringing the plaintiff class to 80 current and former employees.  Two plaintiffs have since dismissed their claims without prejudice, leaving 78 plaintiffs.  In February 2016, PSO filed a motion for summary judgment.  In April 2016, by opinion and order, the court granted PSO s motion for summary judgment and dismissed the case.  Plaintiffs did not appeal the dismissal and the court s order is final. 
    
  Gavin Landfill Litigation (Applies to AEP and OPCo) 
  In August 2014, a complaint was filed in the Mason County, West Virginia Circuit Court against AEP, AEPSC, OPCo and an individual supervisor alleging wrongful death and personal injury/illness claims arising out of purported exposure to coal combustion by-product waste at the Gavin Plant landfill.  As a result of OPCo transferring its generation assets to AGR, the outcome of this complaint will be the responsibility of AGR.  The lawsuit was filed on behalf of 77 plaintiffs, consisting of 39 current and former contractors of the landfill and 38 family members of those contractors.  Eleven of the family members are pursuing personal injury/illness claims and the remainder are pursuing loss of consortium claims.  The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, as well as medical monitoring.  In September 2014, management filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, contending the case should be filed in Ohio.  In August 2015, the court denied the motion.  Management appealed that decision to the West Virginia Supreme Court.  In February 2016, a decision was issued by the court denying the appeal and remanding the case to the West Virginia Mass Litigation Panel, which typically handles multi-plaintiff cases, rather than back to the Mason County, West Virginia Circuit Court.  Defendants  petition for rehearing was denied by the West Virginia Supreme Court.  Management will continue to defend against the claims.  Management believes the provision recorded is adequate.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential additional losses that are reasonably possible of occurring.

6  .    DISPOSITIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE AND IMPAIRMENTS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to AEP only unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  DISPOSITIONS 
    
  2016 
    
  Tanners Creek Plant (Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment) (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  In October 2016, I M sold its retired Tanners Creek plant site including its associated asset retirement obligations (AROs) to a nonaffiliated party.  I M paid   $92 million   and the nonaffiliated party took ownership of the Tanners Creek plant site assets and assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities and AROs, including ash pond closure, asbestos abatement and decommissioning and demolition.  I M does not expect to record a gain or loss related to this sale and will address recovery of Tanner s Creek deferred costs in future rate proceedings.  If any of the costs associated with Tanner s Creek are not recoverable, it could reduce future net income and impact financial condition. 
    
  2015 
    
  Muskingum River Plant (Generation   Marketing Segment) 
    
  In August 2015, AGR sold its retired Muskingum River Plant site including its associated asset retirement obligations to a nonaffiliated party.  AGR paid   $48 million   and the nonaffiliated party took ownership of the Muskingum River Plant site assets and assumed responsibility for environmental liabilities and AROs, including ash pond closure, asbestos abatement and decommissioning and demolition.  As a result of the sale, a net gain of   $32 million   was recognized and recorded in Other Operation on the statements of operations.  The cash paid was recorded in Operating Activities on the statements of cash flows.   
    
  AEPRO (Corporate and Other Segment) 
    
  In October 2015, AEP signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell its commercial barge transportation subsidiary, AEPRO, to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale closed in November 2015.  The nonaffiliated party acquired AEPRO by purchasing all of the common stock of AEP Resources, Inc., the parent company of AEPRO.  The nonaffiliated party assumed certain assets and liabilities of AEPRO, excluding the equity method investment in International Marine Terminals, LLC, pension and benefit assets and liabilities and debt obligations.  Prior to the closing of the sale, AEP retired the debt obligations of AEPRO.  AEP retained ownership of its captive barge fleet that delivers coal to the company s regulated coal-fueled power plant units owned or leased by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KPCo and WPCo.  AEP signed a contract with the nonaffiliated party to dispatch and schedule its captive barge fleet for the company s regulated coal-fueled power plant units.  AEP also has a separate contract with the nonaffiliated party to barge coal for AGR.  These agreements with the nonaffiliated party extend through the end of 2016. 

148 

Results of operations of AEPRO have been classified as discontinued operations on AEP s statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , as shown in the following table: 

In the second quarter of 2016, AEP recorded a   $3 million   loss related to the final accounting for the sale of AEPRO, which was recorded in Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax, on AEP s statements of operations. 
    
  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES HELD FOR SALE 
    
  2016 
    
  Gavin, Waterford, Darby and Lawrenceburg Plants (Generation   Marketing Segment) 
  During the third quarter of 2016, AEP received bids and selected a buyer, received approval from AEP s Board of Directors and signed a Purchase and Sale Agreement to sell AGR s Gavin, Waterford and Darby plants as well as AEGCo s Lawrenceburg plant totaling 5,326 MW of competitive generation assets for approximately   $2.2 billion   to a nonaffiliated party.  The sale is subject to regulatory approvals from the FERC, the IURC and federal clearance pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR).  In October 2016, the Federal Trade Commission granted the sale early termination of the HSR waiting period thereby satisfying the HSR conditions to close the transaction.  The sale is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017. 

149 

Upon evaluation, management concluded that the disposal group met the classification as held for sale in the third quarter of 2016.  Accordingly, the four plants  assets and liabilities have been recorded as Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Held for Sale on AEP s balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and as shown in the table below.  The Income from Continuing Operations before Income Tax Expense and Equity Earnings of the four plants was approximately   $116 million   and   $118 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively, and   $312 million   and   $404 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 

IMPAIRMENTS 
    
  2016 
    
  Merchant Generating Assets (Generation   Marketing Segment) 
    
  In September 2016, due to AEP s ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives for its merchant generation assets, declining forecasts of future energy and capacity prices, and a decreasing likelihood of cost recovery through regulatory proceedings or legislation in the state of Ohio providing for the recovery of AEP s existing Ohio merchant generation assets, AEP performed an impairment analysis at the unit level on the remaining merchant generation assets in accordance with accounting guidance for impairments of long-lived assets.  Cardinal Unit 1, a 43.5% interest in Conesville Unit 4, Conesville Units 5-6, a 26% interest in Stuart Units 1-4, a 25.4% interest in Zimmer Unit 1, and a 54.7% interest in Oklaunion (collectively the  Merchant Coal-Fired Generation Assets ) were subject to this analysis.  Additionally, Racine Hydroelectric Plant ( Racine ), Putnam and I M s Price River coal reserves ( Coal Reserves ) and Desert Sky and Trent Wind Farms ( Wind Farms ) were also included in this analysis.  For the Merchant Coal-Fired Generation Assets, Racine and the Wind Farms, AEP performed step one of the impairment analysis using undiscounted cash flows for the estimated useful lives of the assets based upon energy and capacity price curves, as applicable, which were developed internally with both observable Level 2 third party quotations and unobservable Level 3 inputs, as well as management s forecasts of operating expenses and capital expenditures.  The step one analysis concluded the book value of Racine would be recovered and the book value of the remaining assets would not be recovered. 
    
  AEP performed step two of the impairment analysis on the Merchant Coal-Fired Generation Assets using a ten-year discounted cash flow model based upon forecasted energy and capacity price curves, which were developed internally using both observable Level 2 third party quotations and unobservable Level 3 inputs, as well as management s forecasts of operating expenses and capital expenditures.  The step two analysis resulted in projected negative cash flows.  Based on this result, coupled with the significant capital investments necessary to comply with environmental rules to allow the Merchant Coal-Fired Generation Assets to operate to the end of their currently estimated depreciable lives and the joint-ownership structure of these facilities, management determined the fair value of these assets was $0.  AEP performed step two of the impairment analysis on the Wind Farms using a ten-year discounted cash flow model utilizing forecasted energy price curves, which were developed internally using both observable Level 2 third party quotations and unobservable Level 3 inputs, as well as management s forecasts of operating expenses and capital expenditures.  The results concluded the Wind Farms were also impaired. 
  
   150 

For the Coal Reserves, AEP performed step one of the impairment analysis and concluded the book value of the assets would not be recovered.  Step two of the impairment analysis on the Coal Reserves was performed using a market approach with Level 3 unobservable inputs.  The results concluded the Coal Reserves were also impaired. 
  Based on the impairment analysis performed, in the third quarter of 2016, AEP recorded a pretax impairment of $2.3 billion in Asset Impairments and Other Related Charges on the statement of operations.  See the table below for additional information. 

(a) 
    Includes the   $11 million   book value of I M s Price River Coal Reserves which were fully impaired.  This $11 million impairment is reflected in the Vertically Integrated Utilities Segment.

8  .    BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  AEP s Reportable Segments 
    
  AEP s primary business is the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.  Within its Vertically Integrated Utilities segment, AEP centrally dispatches generation assets and manages its overall utility operations on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight.  Intersegment sales and transfers are generally based on underlying contractual arrangements and agreements. 
    
  AEP s reportable segments and their related business activities are outlined below: 
    
  Vertically Integrated Utilities 

Generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo. 
       
  Transmission and Distribution Utilities 

Transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by OPCo, TCC and TNC. 
                
    OPCo purchases energy and capacity to serve SSO customers and provides transmission and distribution services for all connected load. 
       
  AEP Transmission Holdco 

Development, construction and operation of transmission facilities through investments in AEP s wholly-owned transmission-only subsidiaries and transmission-only joint ventures.  These investments have PUCT-approved or FERC-approved returns on equity. 
       
  Generation   Marketing 

Competitive generation in ERCOT and PJM. 
                
    Marketing, risk management and retail activities in ERCOT, PJM, SPP and MISO. 
       
  The remainder of AEP s activities is presented as Corporate and Other.  While not considered a reportable segment, Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries, Parent s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income and interest expense and other nonallocated costs.  With the sale of AEPRO in November 2015, the activities related to the AEP River Operations segment have been moved to Corporate and Other for the periods presented.  See  AEPRO (Corporate and Other)  section of Note   6   for additional information. 
  
   156 

The tables below present AEP s reportable segment income statement information for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   and reportable segment balance sheet information as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  These amounts include certain estimates and allocations where necessary.  

157 

158 

(a) 
    Corporate and Other primarily includes the purchasing of receivables from certain AEP utility subsidiaries.  This segment also includes Parent s guarantee revenue received from affiliates, investment income, interest income, interest expense and discontinued operations of AEPRO and other nonallocated costs. 
              (b)

              (c) 
    Reconciling Adjustments for Total Assets primarily include the elimination of intercompany advances to affiliates and intercompany accounts receivable along with the elimination of AEP s investments in subsidiary companies. 
     
   159 

Registrant Subsidiaries  Reportable Segments 
    
  The Registrant Subsidiaries each have one reportable segment, an integrated electricity generation, transmission and distribution business, except OPCo, which has an electricity transmission and distribution business.  The Registrant Subsidiaries  other activities are insignificant.  The Registrant Subsidiaries  operations are managed on an integrated basis because of the substantial impact of cost-based rates and regulatory oversight on the business process, cost structures and operating results. 
  
   160 

9  .    DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise. 
    
  OBJECTIVES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
    
  AEPSC is agent for and transacts on behalf of AEP subsidiaries, including the Registrant Subsidiaries.  AEPEP is agent for and transacts on behalf of other AEP subsidiaries. 
    
  The Registrants are exposed to certain market risks as major power producers and participants in the electricity, capacity, natural gas, coal and emission allowance markets.  These risks include commodity price risks which may be subject to capacity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency exchange risk.  These risks represent the risk of loss that may impact the Registrants due to changes in the underlying market prices or rates.  Management utilizes derivative instruments to manage these risks. 
    
  STRATEGIES FOR UTILIZATION OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO ACHIEVE OBJECTIVES 
    
  Risk Management Strategies 
    
  The strategy surrounding the use of derivative instruments primarily focuses on managing risk exposures, future cash flows and creating value utilizing both economic and formal hedging strategies.  The risk management strategies also include the use of derivative instruments for trading purposes which focus on seizing market opportunities to create value driven by expected changes in the market prices of the commodities.  To accomplish these objectives, the Registrants primarily employ risk management contracts including physical and financial forward purchase-and-sale contracts and, to a lesser extent, OTC swaps and options.  Not all risk management contracts meet the definition of a derivative under the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging.   Derivative risk management contracts elected normal under the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception are not subject to the requirements of this accounting guidance. 
    
  The Registrants utilize power, capacity, coal, natural gas, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, heating oil, gasoline and other commodity contracts to manage the risk associated with the energy business.  The Registrants utilize interest rate derivative contracts in order to manage the interest rate exposure associated with the commodity portfolio.  For disclosure purposes, such risks are grouped as  Commodity,  as these risks are related to energy risk management activities.  The Registrants also utilize derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk associated with debt financing and foreign currency risk associated with future purchase obligations denominated in foreign currencies.  For disclosure purposes, these risks are grouped as  Interest Rate and Foreign Currency.   The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. 

161 

The following tables represent the gross notional volume of the Registrants  outstanding derivative contracts as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 
    
  Notional Volume of Derivative Instruments

Notional Volume of Derivative Instruments 
  December 31, 2015 

Fair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Parent enters into interest rate derivative transactions as part of an overall strategy to manage the mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt.  Certain interest rate derivative transactions effectively modify exposure to interest rate risk by converting a portion of fixed-rate debt to a floating rate.  Provided specific criteria are met, these interest rate derivatives may be designated as fair value hedges. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedging Strategies 
    
  The Registrants utilize cash flow hedges on certain derivative transactions for the purchase and sale of power ( Commodity ) in order to manage the variable price risk related to forecasted purchases and sales.  Management monitors the potential impacts of commodity price changes and, where appropriate, enters into derivative transactions to protect profit margins for a portion of future electricity sales and purchases.  The Registrants do not hedge all commodity price risk. 
    
  The Registrants utilize a variety of interest rate derivative transactions in order to manage interest rate risk exposure.  The Registrants also utilize interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate exposure related to future borrowings of fixed-rate debt.  The Registrants do not hedge all interest rate exposure.   
    
  At times, the Registrants are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks primarily when some fixed assets are purchased from foreign suppliers.  In accordance with AEP s risk management policy, the Registrants may utilize foreign currency derivative transactions to protect against the risk of increased cash outflows resulting from a foreign currency s appreciation against the dollar.  The Registrants do not hedge all foreign currency exposure. 
  
   162 

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND THE IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
    
  The accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging  requires recognition of all qualifying derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheets at fair value.  The fair values of derivative instruments accounted for using MTM accounting or hedge accounting are based on exchange prices and broker quotes.  If a quoted market price is not available, the estimate of fair value is based on the best information available including valuation models that estimate future energy prices based on existing market and broker quotes, supply and demand market data and assumptions.  In order to determine the relevant fair values of the derivative instruments, the Registrants apply valuation adjustments for discounting, liquidity and credit quality. 
    
  Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will fail to perform on the contract or fail to pay amounts due.  Liquidity risk represents the risk that imperfections in the market will cause the price to vary from estimated fair value based upon prevailing market supply and demand conditions.  Since energy markets are imperfect and volatile, there are inherent risks related to the underlying assumptions in models used to fair value risk management contracts.  Unforeseen events may cause reasonable price curves to differ from actual price curves throughout a contract s term and at the time a contract settles.  Consequently, there could be significant adverse or favorable effects on future net income and cash flows if market prices are not consistent with management s estimates of current market consensus for forward prices in the current period.  This is particularly true for longer term contracts.  Cash flows may vary based on market conditions, margin requirements and the timing of settlement of risk management contracts. 
    
  According to the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging,  the Registrants reflect the fair values of derivative instruments subject to netting agreements with the same counterparty net of related cash collateral.  For certain risk management contracts, the Registrants are required to post or receive cash collateral based on third party contractual agreements and risk profiles.  For the   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   balance sheets, the Registrants netted cash collateral received from third parties against short-term and long-term risk management assets and cash collateral paid to third parties against short-term and long-term risk management liabilities as follows: 

163

(a) 
    Represents realized and unrealized gains and losses subject to regulatory accounting treatment recorded as either current or noncurrent on the balance sheets. 
     Certain qualifying derivative instruments have been designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts, as provided in the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging.   Derivative contracts that have been designated as normal purchases or normal sales under that accounting guidance are not subject to MTM accounting treatment and are recognized on the statements of income on an accrual basis. 
    
  The accounting for the changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it qualifies for and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship and further, on the type of hedging relationship.  Depending on the exposure, management designates a hedging instrument as a fair value hedge or a cash flow hedge. 
    
  For contracts that have not been designated as part of a hedging relationship, the accounting for changes in fair value depends on whether the derivative instrument is held for trading purposes.  Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments held for trading purposes are included in revenues on a net basis on the statements of income.  Unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivative instruments not held for trading purposes are included in revenues or expenses on the statements of income depending on the relevant facts and circumstances.  Certain derivatives that  
  
   171 

economically hedge future commodity risk are recorded in the same expense line item on the statements of income as that of the associated risk.  However, unrealized and some realized gains and losses in regulated jurisdictions for both trading and non-trading derivative instruments are recorded as regulatory assets (for losses) or regulatory liabilities (for gains) in accordance with the accounting guidance for  Regulated Operations.  
    
  In connection with OPCo s June 2012 - May 2015 ESP, the PUCO ordered OPCo to conduct energy and capacity auctions for its entire SSO load for delivery beginning in June 2015, see Note   4   - Rate Matters.  These auctions resulted in a range of products, including 12-month, 24-month, and 36-month periods.  The delivery period for each contract is scheduled to start on the first day of June of each year, immediately following the auction.  Certain affiliated Vertically Integrated Utility and Generation   Marketing segment entities participated in the auction process and were awarded tranches of OPCo s SSO load.  The underlying contracts are derivatives subject to the accounting guidance for  Derivatives and Hedging  and are accounted for using MTM accounting, unless the contract has been designated as a normal purchase or normal sale. 
    
  Accounting for Fair Value Hedging Strategies (Applies to AEP) 
    
  For fair value hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability or an identified portion thereof attributable to a particular risk), the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item associated with the hedged risk impacts Net Income during the period of change. 
    
  AEP records realized and unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps that are designated and qualify for fair value hedge accounting treatment and any offsetting changes in the fair value of the debt being hedged in Interest Expense on the statements of operations.  The following table shows the results of hedging gains (losses) during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial. 
    
  Accounting for Cash Flow Hedging Strategies 
    
  For cash flow hedges (i.e. hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk), the Registrants initially report the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets until the period the hedged item affects Net Income.  The Registrants recognize any hedge ineffectiveness in Net Income immediately during the period of change, except in regulated jurisdictions where hedge ineffectiveness would be recorded as a regulatory asset (for losses) or a regulatory liability (for gains) if applicable. 
    
  Realized gains and losses on derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of power designated as cash flow hedges are included in Total Revenues or Purchased Electricity for Resale on the statements of income or in Regulatory Assets or Regulatory Liabilities on the balance sheets, depending on the specific nature of the risk being hedged.  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , AEP applied cash flow hedging to outstanding power derivatives.  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Registrant Subsidiaries did not apply cash flow hedging to outstanding power derivatives. 
    
  The Registrants reclassify gains and losses on interest rate derivative hedges related to debt financings from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Interest Expense on the statements of income in those periods in which hedged interest payments occur.  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , AEP applied cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives.  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Registrant Subsidiaries did not apply cash flow hedging to outstanding interest rate derivatives. 
  
   172 

The accumulated gains or losses related to foreign currency hedges are reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets into Depreciation and Amortization expense on the statements of income over the depreciable lives of the fixed assets designated as the hedged items in qualifying foreign currency hedging relationships.  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Registrants did not apply cash flow hedging to any outstanding foreign currency derivatives. 
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial or nonexistent for all of the hedge strategies disclosed above. 
    
  For details on effective cash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets and the reasons for changes in cash flow hedges, see Note   3  . 
    
  Cash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were: 
    
  Impact of Cash Flow Hedges on AEP s Balance Sheets 

(a) 
    Hedging Assets and Hedging Liabilities are included in Risk Management Assets and Liabilities on the balance sheets. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016   the maximum length of time that AEP is hedging its exposure to variability in future cash flows related to forecasted transactions is   135   months. 
    
  Impact of Cash Flow Hedges on the Registrant Subsidiaries  Balance Sheets 

The actual amounts reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to Net Income can differ from the estimate above due to market price changes. 

173 

Credit Risk 
    
  Management limits credit risk in wholesale marketing and trading activities by assessing the creditworthiness of potential counterparties before entering into transactions with them and continuing to evaluate their creditworthiness on an ongoing basis.  Management uses Moody s, Standard and Poor s and current market-based qualitative and quantitative data as well as financial statements to assess the financial health of counterparties on an ongoing basis. 
    
  Master agreements are typically used to facilitate the netting of cash flows associated with a single counterparty and may include collateral requirements.  Collateral requirements in the form of cash, letters of credit and parental/affiliate guarantees may be obtained as security from counterparties in order to mitigate credit risk.  A counterparty is required to post cash or letters of credit in the event exposure exceeds the established threshold.  The threshold represents an unsecured credit limit which may be supported by a parental/affiliate guaranty, as determined in accordance with AEP s credit policy.  In addition, master agreements allow for termination and liquidation of all positions in the event of a failure or inability to post collateral. 
    
  Collateral Triggering Events 
    
  Credit Downgrade Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo, I M, PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  Under the tariffs of the RTOs and Independent System Operators (ISOs) and a limited number of derivative and non-derivative contracts primarily related to competitive retail auction loads, additional amounts of collateral are required if certain credit ratings decline below a specified rating threshold.  The amount of collateral required fluctuates based on market prices and total exposure.  On an ongoing basis, AEP s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these collateral triggering items in contracts.  AEP, APCo, I M, PSO and SWEPCo have not experienced a downgrade below a specified rating threshold that would require the posting of additional collateral.  There is no exposure relating to derivative contracts, however, there is exposure relating to RTOs, ISOs and non-derivative contracts.  The following table represents the exposure if credit ratings were to decline below a specified rating threshold as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(a) 
    Represents the amount of collateral AEP subsidiaries would have been required to post for other significant non-derivative contracts including AGR jointly owned plant contracts and various other commodity related contacts. 

174 

Cross-Default Triggers (Applies to AEP, APCo and I M) 
    
  In addition, a majority of non-exchange traded commodity contracts contain cross-default provisions that, if triggered, would permit the counterparty to declare a default and require settlement of the outstanding payable.  These cross-default provisions could be triggered if there was a non-performance event by Parent or the obligor under outstanding debt or a third party obligation that is   $50 million   or greater.  On an ongoing basis, AEP s risk management organization assesses the appropriateness of these cross-default provisions in the contracts.  The following tables represent: (a) the fair value of these derivative liabilities subject to cross-default provisions prior to consideration of contractual netting arrangements, (b) the amount that the exposure has been reduced by cash collateral posted and (c) if a cross-default provision would have been triggered, the settlement amount that would be required after considering contractual netting arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

  The accounting guidance for  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement).  Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2.  When quoted market prices are not available, pricing may be completed using comparable securities, dealer values, operating data and general market conditions to determine fair value.  Valuation models utilize various inputs such as commodity, interest rate and, to a lesser degree, volatility and credit that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, market corroborated inputs (i.e. inputs derived principally from, or correlated to, observable market data) and other observable inputs for the asset or liability.  The amount of risk taken is determined by the Commercial Operations, Energy Supply and Finance groups in accordance with established risk management policies as approved by the Finance Committee of AEP s Board of Directors.  AEPSC's market risk oversight staff independently monitors risk policies, procedures and risk levels and provides members of the Commercial Operations Risk Committee (Regulated Risk Committee) and the Energy Supply Risk Committee (Competitive Risk Committee) various reports regarding compliance with policies, limits and procedures.  The Regulated Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President of Generation, Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations and Chief Risk Officer.  The Competitive Risk Committee consists of AEPSC s Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer in addition to Energy Supply s President and Vice President. 
    
  For commercial activities, exchange traded derivatives, namely futures contracts, are generally fair valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified as Level 1.  Level 2 inputs primarily consist of OTC broker quotes in moderately active or less active markets, as well as exchange traded contracts where there is insufficient market liquidity to warrant inclusion in Level 1.  Management verifies price curves using these broker quotes and classifies these fair values within Level 2 when substantially all of the fair value can be corroborated.  Management typically obtains multiple broker quotes, which are nonbinding in nature but are based on recent trades in the marketplace.  When multiple broker quotes are obtained, the quoted bid and ask prices are averaged.  In certain circumstances, a broker quote may be discarded if it is a clear outlier.  Management uses a historical correlation analysis between the broker quoted location and the illiquid locations.  If the points are highly correlated, these locations are included within Level 2 as well.  Certain OTC and bilaterally executed derivative instruments are executed in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information.  Illiquid transactions, complex structured transactions, FTRs and counterparty credit risk may require nonmarket based inputs.  Some of these inputs may be internally developed or extrapolated and utilized to estimate fair value.  When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized as Level 3.  The main driver of contracts being classified as Level 3 is the inability to substantiate energy price curves in the market.  A portion of the Level 3 instruments have been economically hedged which limits potential earnings volatility. 
    
  AEP utilizes its trustee s external pricing service to estimate the fair value of the underlying investments held in the nuclear trusts.  AEP s investment managers review and validate the prices utilized by the trustee to determine fair value.  AEP s management performs its own valuation testing to verify the fair values of the securities.  AEP receives audit reports of the trustee s operating controls and valuation processes.  The trustee uses multiple pricing vendors for the assets held in the trusts. 
    
  Assets in the nuclear trusts, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Other Temporary Investments and Restricted Cash for Securitized Funding are classified using the following methods.  Equities are classified as Level 1 holdings if they are actively traded on exchanges.  Items classified as Level 1 are investments in money market funds, fixed income and equity mutual funds and domestic equity securities.  They are valued based on observable inputs, primarily unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets.  Items classified as Level 2 are primarily investments in individual  
  
   176 

fixed income securities and cash equivalent funds.  Fixed income securities generally do not trade on exchanges and do not have an official closing price but their valuation inputs are based on observable market data.  Pricing vendors calculate bond valuations using financial models and matrices.  The models use observable inputs including yields on benchmark securities, quotes by securities brokers, rating agency actions, discounts or premiums on securities compared to par prices, changes in yields for U.S. Treasury securities, corporate actions by bond issuers, prepayment schedules and histories, economic events and, for certain securities, adjustments to yields to reflect changes in the rate of inflation.  Other securities with model-derived valuation inputs that are observable are also classified as Level 2 investments.  Investments with unobservable valuation inputs are classified as Level 3 investments. 
    
  Fair Value Measurements of Long-term Debt 
    
  The fair values of Long-term Debt are based on quoted market prices, without credit enhancements, for the same or similar issues and the current interest rates offered for instruments with similar maturities classified as Level 2 measurement inputs.  These instruments are not marked-to-market.  The estimates presented are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could be realized in a current market exchange. 
    
  The book values and fair values of Long-term Debt for the Registrants as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized in the following table: 

(a) 
    Amounts include debt related to the Lawrenceburg Plant that has been classified as Liabilities Held for Sale on the balance sheet.  See  Gavin, Waterford, Darby and Lawrenceburg Plants (Generation   Marketing Segment)  section of Note   6   for additional information. 
       
  Fair Value Measurements of Other Temporary Investments (Applies to AEP) 
    
  Other Temporary Investments include funds held by trustees primarily for the payment of securitization bonds and securities available for sale, including marketable securities that management intends to hold for less than one year and investments by its protected cell of EIS. 
    
  The following is a summary of Other Temporary Investments: 

177 

(a) 
    Primarily represents amounts held for the repayment of debt. 
              (b) 
    Primarily short and intermediate maturities which may be sold and do not contain maturity dates. 
       
  The following table provides the activity for fixed income and equity securities within Other Temporary Investments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

For details of the reasons for changes in Securities Available for Sale included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , see Note   3  . 
    
  Fair Value Measurements of Trust Assets for Decommissioning and SNF Disposal (Applies to AEP and I M) 
    
  Nuclear decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel trust funds represent funds that regulatory commissions allow I M to collect through rates to fund future decommissioning and spent nuclear fuel disposal liabilities.  By rules or orders, the IURC, the MPSC and the FERC established investment limitations and general risk management guidelines.  In general, limitations include: 

Acceptable investments (rated investment grade or above when purchased). 
                
    Maximum percentage invested in a specific type of investment. 
                
    Prohibition of investment in obligations of AEP, I M or their affiliates. 
                
    Withdrawals permitted only for payment of decommissioning costs and trust expenses. 
       
  I M maintains trust records for each regulatory jurisdiction.  Regulatory approval is required to withdraw decommissioning funds.  These funds are managed by external investment managers who must comply with the guidelines and rules of the applicable regulatory authorities.  The trust assets are invested to optimize the net of tax earnings of the trust giving consideration to liquidity, risk, diversification and other prudent investment objectives. 
    
  I M records securities held in these trust funds in Spent Nuclear Fuel and Decommissioning Trusts on its balance sheets.  I M records these securities at fair value.  I M classifies securities in the trust funds as available-for-sale due to their long-term purpose.  Other-than-temporary impairments for investments in both debt and equity securities are considered realized losses as a result of securities being managed by an external investment management firm.  The external investment management firm makes specific investment decisions regarding the debt and equity investments held in these trusts and generally intends to sell debt securities in an unrealized loss position as part of a tax optimization strategy.  Impairments reduce the cost basis of the securities which will affect any future unrealized gain or realized gain or loss due to the adjusted cost of investment.  I M records unrealized gains and other-than-temporary impairments from securities in these trust funds as adjustments to the regulatory liability account for the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and to regulatory assets or liabilities for the SNF disposal trust funds in accordance with their treatment in rates.  Consequently, changes in fair value of trust assets do not affect earnings or AOCI.

The following is a summary of nuclear trust fund investments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The following table provides the securities activity within the decommissioning and SNF trusts for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  : 

The base cost of fixed income securities was   $913 million   and   $771 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The base cost of equity securities was   $588 million   and   $555 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The fair value of fixed income securities held in the nuclear trust funds, summarized by contractual maturities, as of   September 30, 2016   was as follows:

Fair Value Measurements of Financial Assets and Liabilities 
    
  The following tables set forth, by level within the fair value hierarchy, the Registrants  financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  As required by the accounting guidance for  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Management s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the valuation of fair value assets and liabilities and their placement within the fair value hierarchy levels.  There have not been any significant changes in management s valuation techniques.

  AEP System Tax Allocation Agreement 
    
  AEP and subsidiaries join in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return.  The allocation of the AEP System s current consolidated federal income tax to the AEP System companies allocates the benefit of current tax losses to the AEP System companies giving rise to such losses in determining their current tax expense.  The tax benefit of the Parent is allocated to its subsidiaries with taxable income.  With the exception of the loss of the Parent, the method of allocation reflects a separate return result for each company in the consolidated group. 
    
  Valuation Allowance (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP assesses available positive and negative evidence to estimate whether sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate tax character will be generated to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets.  When the evaluation of the evidence indicates that AEP will not be able to realize the benefits of existing deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce existing deferred tax assets to the net realizable amount.  Objective negative evidence evaluated includes whether AEP has a history of recognizing income of the character which can be offset by capital loss carryforwards.  Other objective negative evidence evaluated is the impact recently enacted federal tax legislation will have on future taxable income and on AEP s ability to benefit from the carryforward of charitable contribution deductions.   
    
  On the basis of this evaluation, AEP recorded a change in the valuation allowance in the third quarter of 2016.  AEP reduced the capital loss valuation allowance by   $66 million   to reflect the impact of the reclassification of certain assets as held for sale and the filing of the 2015 federal income tax return.  The sale of these assets is expected to result in a gain, the character of which allows AEP to use the capital loss and reverse substantially all of the remaining capital loss valuation allowance previously recorded.  
    
  A valuation allowance of   $9 million   has been recorded against AEP s deferred tax asset balance as of September 30, 2016.  The valuation allowance reflects management s assessment of the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized.  The amount of the deferred tax assets realizable, however, could be adjusted if estimates of future taxable income are materially impacted during the carryforward period. 
    
  Federal and State Income Tax Audit Status 
    
  AEP and subsidiaries are no longer subject to U.S. federal examination for years before 2011.  The IRS examination of years 2011, 2012 and 2013 started in April 2014.  AEP and subsidiaries received a Revenue Agents Report in April 2016, completing the 2011 through 2013 audit cycle indicating an agreed upon audit.  The 2011 through 2013 audit was submitted to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for approval.  AEP was informed that the IRS expects the Joint Committee to refer the audit back to the IRS exam team for further consideration.  Although the outcome of tax audits are uncertain, in management s opinion, adequate provisions for federal income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters.  In addition, the Registrants accrue interest on these uncertain tax positions.  Management is not aware of any issues for open tax years that upon final resolution are expected to materially impact net income. 
    
  AEP and subsidiaries file income tax returns in various state, local or foreign jurisdictions.  These taxing authorities routinely examine the tax returns.  AEP and subsidiaries are currently under examination in several state and local jurisdictions.  However, it is possible that previously filed tax returns have positions that may be challenged by these tax authorities.  Management believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such challenges and that the ultimate resolution of these audits will not materially impact net income.  The Registrants  are no longer subject to state, local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2009.

State Tax Legislation (Applies to AEP, PSO and SWEPCo) 
    
  In March 2016, the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts issued clarifying guidance regarding the treatment of transmission and distribution expenses included in the computation of taxable income for purposes of calculating the Texas gross margin tax.  The guidance clarified which specific transmission and distribution expenses are included in the computation of the cost of goods sold deduction.  This guidance resulted in a net favorable adjustment to net income of   $21 million  ,   $2 million   and   $9 million   during the first nine months of 2016 for AEP, PSO and SWEPCo, respectively. 
    
  In March 2016, Louisiana enacted several tax bills impacting income taxes, franchise taxes and sales taxes.  The income tax provisions limit the use of Louisiana net operating losses and the sales tax provisions increase the sales tax rate and suspend or eliminate certain exemptions.  The legislation is not expected to materially impact net income or cash flows.

Long-term Debt Activity 
    
  Long-term debt and other securities issued, retired and principal payments made during the first   nine   months of   2016   are shown in the tables below: 

(a) 
    Amounts indicated on the statements of cash flows are net of issuance costs and premium or discount and will not tie to the issuance amounts. 
     
   196 

In October 2016, I M retired   $16 million   of Notes Payable related to DCC Fuel. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , trustees held, on behalf of AEP,   $614 million   of their reacquired Pollution Control Bonds.  Of this total,   $40 million   and   $345 million   related to I M and OPCo, respectively. 
    
  Dividend Restrictions 
    
  Parent Restrictions (Applies to AEP) 
    
  The holders of AEP s common stock are entitled to receive the dividends declared by the Board of Directors provided funds are legally available for such dividends.  Parent s income primarily derives from common stock equity in the earnings of its utility subsidiaries. 
    
  Pursuant to the leverage restrictions in credit agreements, AEP must maintain a percentage of debt to total capitalization at a level that does not exceed   67.5%  .  The payment of cash dividends indirectly results in an increase in the percentage of debt to total capitalization of the company distributing the dividend.  The method for calculating outstanding debt and capitalization is contractually defined in the credit agreements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , none of AEP s retained earnings were restricted for the purpose of the payment of dividends. 

197 

Utility Subsidiaries  Restrictions 
    
  AEP utility subsidiaries pay dividends to Parent provided funds are legally available.  Various financing arrangements and regulatory requirements may impose certain restrictions on the ability of the subsidiaries to transfer funds to Parent in the form of dividends. 
    
  Certain AEP subsidiaries have credit agreements that contain a covenant that limits their debt to capitalization ratio to   67.5%  . 
    
  The Federal Power Act prohibits the utility subsidiaries from participating  in the making or paying of any dividends of such public utility from any funds properly included in capital account.   Additionally, the Federal Power Act creates a reserve on earnings attributable to hydroelectric generation plants.  Because of their ownership of such plants, this reserve applies to AGR, APCo and I M.  As of   September 30, 2016  , these restrictions did not limit the ability of the  subsidiaries to pay dividends out of retained earnings. 
    
  Corporate Borrowing Program - AEP System (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries) 
    
  The AEP System uses a corporate borrowing program to meet the short-term borrowing needs of AEP s subsidiaries.  The corporate borrowing program includes a Utility Money Pool, which funds AEP s utility subsidiaries, and a Nonutility Money Pool, which funds certain AEP nonutility subsidiaries.  The AEP System Utility Money Pool operates in accordance with the terms and conditions of the AEP System Utility Money Pool agreement filed with the FERC.  The amounts of outstanding loans to (borrowings from) the Utility Money Pool as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are included in Advances to Affiliates and Advances from Affiliates, respectively, on each of the Registrant Subsidiaries  balance sheets.  The Utility Money Pool participants  money pool activity and their corresponding authorized borrowing limits for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are described in the following table: 

The activity in the above table does not include short-term lending activity of SWEPCo s wholly-owned subsidiary, Mutual Energy SWEPCo, LLC, which is a participant in the Nonutility Money Pool.  The amounts of outstanding loans to the Nonutility Money Pool as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are included in Advances to Affiliates on SWEPCo s balance sheets.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Mutual Energy SWEPCo, LLC had the following activity in the Nonutility Money Pool:

Sale of Receivables   AEP Credit (Applies to AEP) 
    
  AEP Credit has a receivables securitization agreement with bank conduits.  Under the securitization agreement, AEP Credit receives financing from the bank conduits for the interest in the receivables AEP Credit acquires from affiliated utility subsidiaries.  These securitized transactions allow AEP Credit to repay its outstanding debt obligations, continue to purchase the operating companies  receivables and accelerate AEP Credit s cash collections. 
    
  AEP Credit s receivables securitization agreement provides a commitment of   $750 million   from bank conduits to purchase receivables and expires in   June 2018  . 
    
  Accounts receivable information for AEP Credit is as follows: 

AEP Credit s delinquent customer accounts receivable represent accounts greater than 30 days past due. 
    
  Sale of Receivables   AEP Credit (Applies to Registrant Subsidiaries) 
    
  Under this sale of receivables arrangement, the Registrant Subsidiaries sell, without recourse, certain of their customer accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenue balances to AEP Credit and are charged a fee based on AEP Credit s financing costs, administrative costs and uncollectible accounts experience for each Registrant Subsidiary s receivables.  APCo does not have regulatory authority to sell its West Virginia accounts receivable.  The costs of customer accounts receivable sold are reported in Other Operation expense on the Registrant Subsidiaries  statements of income.  The Registrant Subsidiaries manage and service their customer accounts receivable, which are sold to AEP Credit.  AEP Credit securitizes the eligible receivables for the operating companies and retains the remainder. 
    
  The amount of accounts receivable and accrued unbilled revenues under the sale of receivables agreement for each Registrant Subsidiary as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows:

13  .    VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
    
  The disclosures in this note apply to all Registrants unless indicated otherwise.  
    
  The accounting guidance for  Variable Interest Entities  is a consolidation model that considers if a company has a controlling financial interest in a VIE.  A controlling financial interest will have both (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.  Entities are required to consolidate a VIE when it is determined that they have a controlling financial interest in a VIE and therefore, are the primary beneficiary of that VIE, as defined by the accounting guidance for  Variable Interest Entities.   In determining whether AEP is the primary beneficiary of a VIE, management considers factors such as equity at risk, the amount of the VIE s variability AEP absorbs, guarantees of indebtedness, voting rights including kick-out rights, the power to direct the VIE, variable interests held by related parties and other factors.  Management believes that significant assumptions and judgments were applied consistently.  
    
  AEP is the primary beneficiary of Sabine, DCC Fuel, Transition Funding, Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding, Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding, AEP Credit, a protected cell of EIS and Transource Energy.  In addition, AEP has not provided material financial or other support to any of these entities that was not previously contractually required.  AEP holds a significant variable interest in DHLC and Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline, LLC West Virginia Series (West Virginia Series). 
    
  Consolidated Variable Interests Entities 
    
  Sabine is a mining operator providing mining services to SWEPCo.  SWEPCo has no equity investment in Sabine but is Sabine s only customer.  SWEPCo guarantees the debt obligations and lease obligations of Sabine.  Under the terms of the note agreements, substantially all assets are pledged and all rights under the lignite mining agreement are assigned to SWEPCo.  The creditors of Sabine have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo.  Under the provisions of the mining agreement, SWEPCo is required to pay, as a part of the cost of lignite delivered, an amount equal to mining costs plus a management fee.  In addition, SWEPCo determines how much coal will be mined each year.  Based on these facts, management concluded that SWEPCo is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate Sabine.  SWEPCo s total billings from Sabine for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $42 million   and   $41 million  , respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $127 million   and   $124 million  , respectively.  See the tables below for the classification of Sabine s assets and liabilities on SWEPCo s balance sheets. 
    
  I M has nuclear fuel lease agreements with DCC Fuel, which was formed for the purpose of acquiring, owning and leasing nuclear fuel to I M.  DCC Fuel purchased the nuclear fuel from I M with funds received from the issuance of notes to financial institutions.  Each DCC Fuel entity is a single-lessee leasing arrangement with only one asset and is capitalized with all debt.  Each is a separate legal entity from I M, the assets of which are not available to satisfy the debts of I M.  Payments on the leases for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $23 million   and   $29 million  , respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $77 million   and   $86 million  , respectively.  The leases were recorded as capital leases on I M s balance sheet as title to the nuclear fuel transfers to I M at the end of the respective lease terms, which do not exceed 54 months.  Based on I M s control of DCC Fuel, management concluded that I M is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate DCC Fuel.  The capital leases are eliminated upon consolidation.  See the tables below for the classification of DCC Fuel s assets and liabilities on I M s balance sheets. 
    
  Transition Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to Texas Restructuring Legislation.  Management has concluded that TCC is the primary beneficiary of Transition Funding because TCC has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and TCC s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, TCC is required to consolidate Transition Funding.  The securitized bonds totaled   $1.3 billion   and   $1.5 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated and Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets.  Transition  
  
   202 

Funding has securitized transition assets of   $1.1 billion   and   $1.3 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets.  The securitized transition assets represent the right to impose and collect Texas true-up costs from customers receiving electric transmission or distribution service from TCC under recovery mechanisms approved by the PUCT.  The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized transition assets.  The bondholders have no recourse to TCC or any other AEP entity.  TCC acts as the servicer for Transition Funding s securitized transition assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Transition Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs.  See the tables below for the classification of Transition Funding s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  
    
  Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to phase-in recovery property.  Management has concluded that OPCo is the primary beneficiary of Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding because OPCo has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and OPCo s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, OPCo is required to consolidate Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding.  The securitized bonds totaled   $140 million   and   $185 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated and Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets. Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding has securitized assets of   $68 million   and   $86 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets.  The phase-in recovery property represents the right to impose and collect Ohio deferred distribution charges from customers receiving electric transmission and distribution service from OPCo under a recovery mechanism approved by the PUCO.  In August 2013, securitization bonds were issued.  The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets.  The bondholders have no recourse to OPCo or any other AEP entity.  OPCo acts as the servicer for Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding s securitized assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs.  See the tables below for the classification of Ohio Phase-in-Recovery Funding s assets and liabilities on OPCo s balance sheets.  
    
  Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding was formed for the sole purpose of issuing and servicing securitization bonds related to APCo s under-recovered ENEC deferral balance.  Management has concluded that APCo is the primary beneficiary of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding because APCo has the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and APCo s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, APCo is required to consolidate Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding.  The securitized bonds totaled   $319 million   and   $342 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in Long-term Debt Due Within One Year - Nonaffiliated and Long-term Debt - Nonaffiliated on the balance sheets.  Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding has securitized assets of   $311 million   and   $328 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which are presented separately on the face of the balance sheets.  The phase-in recovery property represents the right to impose and collect West Virginia deferred generation charges from customers receiving electric transmission, distribution and generation service from APCo under a recovery mechanism approved by the WVPSC.  In November 2013, securitization bonds were issued.  The securitization bonds are payable only from and secured by the securitized assets.  The bondholders have no recourse to APCo or any other AEP entity.  APCo acts as the servicer for Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding s securitized assets and remits all related amounts collected from customers to Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding for interest and principal payments on the securitization bonds and related costs.  See the tables below for the classification of Appalachian Consumer Rate Relief Funding s assets and liabilities on APCo s balance sheets.  
    
  AEP Credit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.  AEP Credit purchases, without recourse, accounts receivable from certain utility subsidiaries of AEP to reduce working capital requirements.  AEP provides a minimum of   5%   equity and up to   20%   of AEP Credit s short-term borrowing needs in excess of third party financings.  Any third party financing of AEP Credit only has recourse to the receivables securitized for such financing.  Based on AEP s control of AEP Credit, management concluded that AEP is the primary beneficiary and is required to consolidate AEP Credit.  See the tables below for the classification of AEP Credit s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  See  Sale of Receivables - AEP Credit  section of Note   12  . 

203 

AEP s subsidiaries participate in one protected cell of EIS for approximately ten lines of insurance.  EIS has multiple protected cells.  Neither AEP nor its subsidiaries have an equity investment in EIS.  The AEP System is essentially this EIS cell s only participant, but allows certain third parties access to this insurance.  AEP s subsidiaries and any allowed third parties share in the insurance coverage, premiums and risk of loss from claims.  Based on AEP s control and the structure of the protected cell of EIS, management concluded that AEP is the primary beneficiary of the protected cell and is required to consolidate the protected cell of EIS.  The insurance premium expense to the protected cell for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $15 million   and   $13 million  , respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   was   $28 million   and   $27 million  , respectively.  See the tables below for the classification of the protected cell s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  The amount reported as equity is the protected cell s policy holders  surplus. 
    
  Transource Energy was formed for the purpose of investing in utilities which develop, acquire, construct, own and operate transmission facilities in accordance with FERC-approved rates.  AEP has equity and voting ownership of   86.5%   with the other owner having   13.5%   interest.  Management has concluded that Transource Energy is a VIE and that AEP is the primary beneficiary because AEP has the power to direct the most significant activities of the entity and AEP s equity interest could potentially be significant.  Therefore, AEP is required to consolidate Transource Energy.  In January 2014, Transource Missouri (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Transource Energy) acquired transmission assets from the non-controlling owner and issued debt and received a capital contribution to fund the acquisition.  The majority of Transource Energy s activity resulted from the asset acquisition, construction projects, debt issuance and capital contribution.  AEP has provided capital contributions to Transource Energy of   $38 million   and   $47 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  AEP and the other owner of Transource Energy are required to ensure a specific equity level in Transource Missouri upon completion of projects or if a project is abandoned by the RTO.  See the tables below for the classification of Transource Energy s assets and liabilities on the balance sheets.  
    
  The balances below represent the assets and liabilities of the VIEs that are consolidated.  These balances include intercompany transactions that are eliminated upon consolidation. 

(a) 
    Includes an intercompany item eliminated in consolidation of   $60.2 million  .

  Non-Consolidated Significant Variable Interests 
    
  DHLC is a mining operator which sells   50%   of the lignite produced to SWEPCo and   50%   to CLECO.  SWEPCo and CLECO share the executive board seats and voting rights equally.  Each entity guarantees   50%   of DHLC s debt.  SWEPCo and CLECO equally approve DHLC s annual budget.  The creditors of DHLC have no recourse to any AEP entity other than SWEPCo.  As SWEPCo is the sole equity owner of DHLC, it receives   100%   of the management fee.  SWEPCo s total billings from DHLC for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $15 million   and   $30 million  , respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $43 million   and   $59 million  , respectively.  SWEPCo is not required to consolidate DHLC as it is not the primary beneficiary, although SWEPCo holds a significant variable interest in DHLC.  SWEPCo s equity investment in DHLC is included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on SWEPCo s balance sheets. 
    
  SWEPCo s investment in DHLC was: 

AEP and FirstEnergy Corp. (FirstEnergy) have a joint venture in Potomac-Appalachian Transmission Highline, LLC (PATH).  PATH is a series limited liability company and was created to construct, through its operating companies, a high-voltage transmission line project in the PJM region.  PATH consists of the  West Virginia Series (PATH-WV),  owned equally by subsidiaries of FirstEnergy and AEP, and the  Allegheny Series  which is   100%   owned by a subsidiary of FirstEnergy.  Provisions exist within the PATH-WV agreement that make it a VIE.  AEP has no interest or control in the  Allegheny Series .  AEP is not required to consolidate PATH-WV as AEP is not the primary beneficiary, although AEP holds a significant variable interest in PATH-WV.  AEP s equity investment in PATH-WV is included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheets.  AEP and FirstEnergy share the returns and losses equally in PATH-WV.  AEP s subsidiaries and FirstEnergy s subsidiaries provide services to the PATH companies through service agreements.  The entities recover costs through regulated rates. 
  
   205 

In August 2012, the PJM board cancelled the PATH Project, the transmission project that PATH was intended to develop and removed it from the 2012 Regional Transmission Expansion Plan.  In September 2012, the PATH Project companies submitted an application to the FERC requesting authority to recover prudently-incurred costs associated with the PATH Project.  In November 2012, the FERC issued an order accepting the PATH Project s abandonment cost recovery application, subject to settlement procedures and hearing.  The parties to the case have been unable to reach a settlement agreement and in March 2014, settlement judge procedures were terminated.  Hearings at FERC were held in March and April 2015.  In April 2015, PATH filed a stipulation agreement with the FERC that agreed to a   50%   debt and   50%   equity capital structure and a   4.7%   cost of long-term debt for the entire amortization period.  In September 2015, the Administrative Law Judge who conducted the hearings issued an Initial Decision, which if adopted by the FERC, would deem certain costs not recoverable.  The Initial Decision has no binding effect.  Additional briefing was submitted during the fourth quarter of 2015.  The case is currently pending before FERC.  Depending on the outcome of this proceeding, PATH-WV may be required to refund certain amounts that have been collected under its formula rate.  Management believes its financial statements adequately address the potential impact of this proceeding. 
    
  AEP s investment in PATH-WV was: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , AEP s   $21 million   investment in PATH-WV was included in Deferred Charges and Other Noncurrent Assets on the balance sheet.  If AEP cannot ultimately recover the investment related to PATH-WV, it could reduce future net income and cash flows.  
    
  AEPSC provides certain managerial and professional services to AEP s subsidiaries.  Parent is the sole equity owner of AEPSC.  AEP management controls the activities of AEPSC.  The costs of the services are based on a direct charge or on a prorated basis and billed to the AEP subsidiary companies at AEPSC s cost.  AEP subsidiaries have not provided financial or other support outside of the reimbursement of costs for services rendered.  AEPSC finances its operations through cost reimbursement from other AEP subsidiaries.  There are no other terms or arrangements between AEPSC and any of the AEP subsidiaries that could require additional financial support from an AEP subsidiary or expose them to losses outside of the normal course of business.  AEPSC and its billings are subject to regulation by the FERC.  AEP subsidiaries are exposed to losses to the extent they cannot recover the costs of AEPSC through their normal business operations.  AEP subsidiaries are considered to have a significant interest in AEPSC due to their activity in AEPSC s cost reimbursement structure.  However, AEP subsidiaries do not have control over AEPSC.  AEPSC is consolidated by AEP.  In the event AEPSC would require financing or other support outside the cost reimbursement billings, this financing would be provided by AEP. 
    
  Total AEPSC billings to the Registrant Subsidiaries were as follows:

The carrying amount and classification of variable interest in AEPSC s accounts payable are as follows: 

AEGCo, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AEP, is consolidated by AEP.  AEGCo owns a   50%   ownership interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 1, leases a   50%   interest in Rockport Plant, Unit 2 and owns   100%   of the Lawrenceburg Generating Station.  AEGCo sells all the output from the Rockport Plant to I M and KPCo.  AEGCo has a Unit Power Agreement associated with the Lawrenceburg Generating Station which was assigned by OPCo to AGR effective January 1, 2014.  AEP has agreed to provide AEGCo with the funds necessary to satisfy all of the debt obligations of AEGCo.  I M is considered to have a significant interest in AEGCo due to these transactions.  I M is exposed to losses to the extent it cannot recover the costs of AEGCo through its normal business operations.  In the event AEGCo would require financing or other support outside the billings to I M and KPCo, this financing would be provided by AEP.  Total billings to I M from AEGCo for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $65 million   and   $67 million  , respectively, and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   were   $166 million   and   $182 million  , respectively.  The carrying amount of I M s liabilities associated with AEGCo as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $17 million   and   $17 million  , respectively.  Management estimates the maximum exposure of loss to be equal to the amount of such liability.  For additional information regarding AEGCo s lease, see  Rockport Lease  section of Note 13 in the 2015 Annual Report.  The assets and liabilities of AEGCo s Lawrenceburg Plant have been recorded as Assets Held for Sale and Liabilities Held for Sale, respectively, on the balance sheet as of September 30, 2016.  See  Assets and Liabilities Held For Sale  section of Note   6   for additional information.

The Committee, in its discretion, shall determine the methodology or manner of making such substitution or adjustment. 
    
  (b) The Committee, in its sole discretion, may also make appropriate adjustments in the terms of any Awards under this Plan to reflect, or that relate to, the changes or distributions described in Section 4.04 and to modify any other terms of outstanding Awards, including modifications of performance goals and changes in the length of Performance Periods.

Subject to Section 12.05, the Committee may make adjustments in the terms and conditions of, and the criteria included in, Awards in recognition of unusual or nonrecurring events (including, without limitation, the events described in Section 4.04) affecting the Company or the financial statements of the Company or of changes in applicable laws, regulations, or accounting principles, whenever the Committee determines that such adjustments are appropriate in order to prevent unintended dilution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Plan. The determination of the Committee as to the foregoing adjustments, if any, shall be conclusive and binding on Participants under this Plan. By accepting an Award under this Plan, a Participant agrees to any adjustment to the Award made pursuant to this Section 18.02 without further consideration or action.

amendment of this Plan or an Award Agreement shall adversely affect in any material way any Award previously granted under this Plan, without the written consent of the Participant holding such Award.  
    
  18.04 Amendment to Conform to Law.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, the Board or Committee may amend the Plan or an Award Agreement, to take effect retroactively or otherwise, as deemed necessary or advisable for the purpose of conforming the Plan or an Award Agreement to any law relating to plans of this or similar nature, and to the administrative regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder. By accepting an Award under this Plan, a Participant agrees to any amendment made pursuant to this Section 18.04 to the Plan and any Award without further consideration or action.  
  ARTICLE 19 - WITHHOLDING 
    
  The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold, or require a Participant to remit to the Company, the minimum statutory amount to satisfy federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Plan. Participants may elect to satisfy the withholding requirements, in whole or in part, by having the Company withhold shares having a Fair Market Value on the date the tax is to be determined equal to the minimum statutory total tax that could be imposed on the transaction. The Participant shall remain responsible at all times for paying any federal, state, and local income or employment tax due with respect to any Award, and the Company shall not be liable for any interest or penalty that a Participant incurs by failing to make timely payments of tax. 
  ARTICLE 20 - SUCCESSORS 
    
  All obligations of the Company under this Plan with respect to Awards granted hereunder shall be binding on any successor to the Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company. 
  ARTICLE 21 - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
    
  Section 21.01. Forfeiture Events.   (a) The Committee may specify in an Award Agreement that the Participant s rights, payments, and benefits with respect to an Award shall be subject to reduction, cancellation, forfeiture, or recoupment upon the occurrence of certain specified events, in addition to any otherwise applicable vesting or performance conditions of an Award. Such events may include, but shall not be limited to, termination of employment for cause (as defined in the Award Agreement), termination of the Participant s provision of services to the Company, Affiliate, and/or Subsidiary, violation of material Company, Affiliate, and/or Subsidiary policies, breach of noncompetition, confidentiality, or  
  
   Page 21 

other restrictive covenants that may apply to the Participant, or other conduct by the Participant that is detrimental to the business or reputation of the Company, its Affiliates, and/or its Subsidiaries. 
       
  (b) All Awards shall be subject to the Company s compensation recoupment policy as such policy may be in effect from time to time.  
    
  Section 21.02. Legend.   The certificates or statements of holdings for Shares may include any legend which the Committee deems appropriate to reflect any restrictions on transfer of such Shares. 
    
  Section 21.03. Gender and Number.   Except where otherwise indicated by the context, any masculine term used herein also shall include the feminine, the plural shall include the singular, and the singular shall include the plural. 
    
  Section 21.04. Severability.   In the event any provision of this Plan shall be held illegal or invalid for any reason, the illegality or invalidity shall not affect the remaining parts of this Plan, and this Plan shall be construed and enforced as if the illegal or invalid provision had not been included. 
    
  Section 21.05. Requirements of Law.   The granting of Awards and the issuance of Shares under this Plan shall be subject to all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, and to such approvals by any governmental agencies or national securities exchanges as may be required. 

Section 21.06. Delivery of Title.   The Company shall have no obligation to issue or deliver evidence of title for Shares issued under this Plan prior to: (a) obtaining any approvals from governmental agencies that the Company determines are necessary or advisable; and (b) completion of any registration or other qualification of the Shares under any applicable national or foreign law or ruling of any governmental body that the Company determines to be necessary or advisable. 
    
  Section 21.07. Inability to Obtain Authority.   The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company s counsel to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of any Shares hereunder, shall relieve the Company of any liability in respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such requisite authority shall not have been obtained. 
    
  Section 21.08. Investment Representations  . The Committee may require any individual receiving Shares pursuant to an Award under this Plan to represent and warrant in writing that the individual is acquiring the Shares for investment and without any present intention to sell or distribute such Shares. 

Page 22 

Section 21.09. Uncertificated Shares.   To the extent that this Plan provides for issuance of certificates to reflect the transfer or issuance of Shares, the transfer or issuance of such Shares may be effected on a non-certificated basis, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange upon which the Shares are listed. 
    
  Section 21.10. Unfunded Plan.   Participants shall have no right, title, or interest whatsoever in or to any investments that the Company, and/or its Subsidiaries, and/or its Affiliates may make to aid it in meeting its obligations under this Plan. Nothing contained in this Plan, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, shall create or be construed to create a trust of any kind, or a fiduciary relationship between the Company and any Participant, beneficiary, legal representative, or any other individual. To the extent that any individual acquires a right to receive payments from the Company, its Subsidiaries, and/or its Affiliates under this Plan, such right shall be no greater than the right of an unsecured general creditor of the Company, a Subsidiary, or an Affiliate, as the case may be. All payments to be made hereunder shall be paid from the general funds of the Company, a Subsidiary, or an Affiliate, as the case may be, and no special or separate fund shall be established and no segregation of assets shall be made to assure payment of such amounts. 
    
  Section 21.11. No Fractional Shares.   No fractional Shares shall be issued or delivered pursuant to this Plan or any Award unless authorized by the Committee. If the Committee does not authorize the issuance or delivery of fraction shares, then the Committee shall determine whether cash, Awards, or other property shall be granted or paid in lieu of fractional Shares or whether such fractional Shares or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated. 
    
  Section 21.12. Retirement and Welfare Plans.   Neither Awards made under this Plan nor Shares or cash paid pursuant to such Awards may be included as  compensation  for purposes of computing the benefits payable to any Participant under the Company s or any Subsidiary s or Affiliate s retirement plans (both qualified and non-qualified) or welfare benefit plans unless such other plan expressly provides that such compensation shall be taken into account in computing a Participant s benefit. 
    
  Section 21.13. Deferred Compensation.   With respect to Awards subject to Code Section 409A, the Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A, and the provisions of the Plan and any Award Agreement shall be interpreted in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Code Section 409A, and the Plan is intended to be operated accordingly. The Committee may make changes in the terms or operation of the Plan and/or Awards (including changes that may have retroactive effect) deemed necessary or desirable to comply with Code Section 409A. The Company, however, makes no representation or covenants that the Plan or Awards will comply with Section 409A.  
    
  Section 21.14. Non-exclusivity of this Plan.   The adoption of this Plan shall not be construed as creating any limitations on the power of the Board or Committee to adopt such other compensation arrangements as it may deem desirable for any Participant. 
  
   Page 23 

Section 21.15. No Constraint on Corporate Action.   Nothing in this Plan shall be construed to: (a) limit, impair, or otherwise affect the Company s or a Subsidiary s or an Affiliate s right or power to make adjustments, reclassifications, reorganizations, or changes of its capital or business structure, or to merge or consolidate, or dissolve, liquidate, sell, or transfer all or any part of its business or assets; or (b) limit the right or power of the Company or a Subsidiary or an Affiliate to take any action which such entity deems to be necessary or appropriate. 
    
  Section 21.16. Governing Law.   The Plan and each Award Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the state of Ohio, excluding any conflicts or choice of law rule or principle that might otherwise refer construction or interpretation of this Plan to the substantive law of another jurisdiction. Unless otherwise provided in the Award Agreement, recipients of an Award under this Plan are deemed to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the federal or state courts of Ohio, to resolve any and all issues that may arise out of or relate to this Plan or any related Award Agreement  . 
    
  Section 21.17. Indemnification  . (a)         Subject to requirements and limitations of applicable law, each individual who is or shall have been a member of the Board, or a Committee appointed by the Board, or an officer of the Company, a Subsidiary, or an Affiliate to whom authority was delegated in accordance with Article 3, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Company against and from any loss, cost, liability, or expense that may be imposed upon or reasonably incurred by him in connection with or resulting from any claim, action, suit, or proceeding to which he may be a party or in which he may be involved by reason of any action taken or failure to act under this Plan and against and from any and all amounts paid by him in settlement thereof, with the Company s approval, or paid by him in satisfaction of any judgment in any such action, suit, or proceeding against him, provided he shall give the Company an opportunity, at its own expense, to handle and defend the same before he undertakes to handle and defend it on his own behalf, unless such loss, cost, liability, or expense is a result of his own willful misconduct or except as expressly provided by statute. 
    
  (b) The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of any other rights of indemnification to which such individuals may be entitled under the Company s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws, as a matter of law, or otherwise, or any power that the Company may have to indemnify them or hold them harmless. 
    
  Section 21.18. No Guarantee of Favorable Tax Treatment  . Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary or any action taken by the Company, Subsidiaries, or the Board with respect to any income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, or other tax, the acceptance of an Award under the Plan represents the Participant s acknowledgement that the ultimate liability for any tax owed by the Participant is and remains the Participant s responsibility, and that the Company makes no representations or warranties about the tax treatment of any Award, and does not commit to structure any aspect of the Award to reduce or eliminate a Participant s tax liability, including without limitation, Code Section 409A.

  Section 2.2      Purchase Price Adjustment. 
    
  (a)  At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will deliver to Buyer a worksheet setting forth Sellers  good faith reasonable estimate of (i) the Capital Expenditures Adjustment Amount, if any, (ii) the Coal Inventory Adjustment Amount and (iii) the Aggregate Adjustment Amount (the    Estimated Aggregate Adjustment Amount   ), together with reasonable detail and supporting material regarding the computations thereof.  The Base Purchase Price payable at Closing will be increased or decreased, as applicable, by an amount equal to the Estimated Aggregate Adjustment Amount. 
    
  (b)  Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Sellers will prepare and deliver to Buyer a computation (the    Adjustment Statement   ) of the actual (i) Capital Expenditures Adjustment Amount, if any, (ii) Coal Inventory Adjustment Amount and (iii) Aggregate Adjustment Amount (the    Actual Aggregate Adjustment Amount   ), together with reasonable detail and supporting material regarding the computations thereof.  If within thirty (30) days following delivery of such Adjustment Statement, Buyer does not object in writing thereto to Sellers, then the Actual Aggregate Adjustment Amount shall be as reflected on the Adjustment Statement. 
    
  (c)  If within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Adjustment Statement, Buyer objects to any items set forth in the Adjustment Statement to Sellers in writing identifying with specificity the items on the Adjustment Statement to which Buyer objects, the basis for such objection and Buyer s proposed revisions to the Adjustment Statement addressing such objections, then Buyer and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their disagreement.  Should such negotiations not result in an agreement within twenty (20) days after receipt by Sellers of such written objection from Buyer, then the disputed items shall be submitted for resolution and determination to the Independent Accounting Firm.  The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to Buyer and Sellers a written determination of such disputed items (such determination to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information provided to the Independent Accounting Firm by Buyer and Sellers) within thirty (30) days of the submission of the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties.

All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this   Section 2.2   will be allocated between Sellers and Buyer in inverse proportion as each shall prevail in respect of the dollar amount of disputed items so submitted (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm).  
      
  (d)  If, following the determination of the Actual Aggregate Adjustment Amount (as agreed between the Parties or as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm), the Estimated Aggregate Adjustment Amount   less   the Actual Aggregate Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then Sellers shall be obligated to pay Buyer a cash payment equal to such positive number.  If the Estimated Aggregate Adjustment Amount   less   the Actual Aggregate Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then Buyer shall be obligated to pay Sellers a cash payment equal to the absolute value of such negative number.  Any such payment, together with interest thereon at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum from the Closing Date through the date of payment, will be due and payable within ten (10) Business Days after the Actual Aggregate Adjustment Amount is finally determined as provided in this   Section 2.2   and will be payable by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such account or accounts as shall be specified by Buyer or Sellers, as applicable, to the other Party in writing.  Any such payment will be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law. 
    
  (e)  Following the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate and provide each other and, if applicable, the Independent Accounting Firm, with reasonable access to such Books and Records and employees as are reasonably requested in connection with the preparation of the Adjustment Statement and the other matters addressed in this   Section 2.2  .

  (a)  Not later than 90 days after the Closing, Buyer shall provide Sellers with an allocation of the Purchase Price, plus any liabilities deemed assumed for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, among the Acquired Assets as of the Closing Date using the allocation method provided by Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury regulations thereunder (the    Purchase Price Allocation   ).  The Purchase Price Allocation shall be subject to the consent of Sellers, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  The Parties shall reasonably cooperate to comply with all substantive and procedural requirements of Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder, and except for any adjustments to the Purchase Price, the Purchase Price Allocation shall be adjusted only if and to the extent necessary to comply with such requirements.  Buyer and Sellers agree that they will not take nor will they permit any Affiliate to take, for Tax purposes, any position inconsistent with such Purchase Price Allocation;   provided, however  , that (a) Buyer s cost may differ from the total amount allocated hereunder to reflect, for example, the inclusion in the total cost of items (such as capitalized acquisition costs) not included in the total amount so allocated and (b) the amount realized by Sellers may differ from the amount allocated to reflect, for example, transaction costs that reduce the amount realized for federal income Tax purposes;   provided, further  , that nothing contained herein shall prevent Buyer or any Seller from settling in good faith any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any governmental authority based upon or arising out of the Purchase Price Allocation, and neither Buyer nor any Seller shall be required to litigate before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any governmental authority challenging such Purchase  
  
   10 

Price Allocation.  Sellers, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, shall notify Buyer or Sellers, respectively, within twenty (20) days after notice or commencement of an examination, audit or other proceeding regarding the allocation determined under this   Section 2.3  . 
    
  (b)  Buyer and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve any disagreement with respect to the Purchase Price Allocation,   provided that   if such negotiations do not result in an agreement within twenty (20) days after Sellers  receipt of the Purchase Price Allocation from Buyer, then the matter shall be submitted for resolution and determination to the Independent Accounting Firm.  The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to Buyer and Sellers a written determination of the disputed Purchase Price Allocation within thirty (30) days of the submission of the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties subject to any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price Allocation required due to any subsequent adjustments to the Purchase Price (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made pursuant to   Section 2.4   of this Agreement). 
    
  Section 2.4      Acquired Assets Proration. 
    
  (a)  Buyer and Sellers agree that, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, with respect to the sale of the Acquired Assets, all of the items listed in   Schedule 2.4   (including any Prepayments with respect to such items) (collectively, the    Prorated Items   ) relating to the Acquired Assets shall be prorated as of the Closing in accordance with this   Section 2.4  .   Schedule 2.4   also contains a description of the calculation of the proration of the real property Taxes and other Taxes attributable to the Acquired Assets. 
    
  (b)  At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will deliver to Buyer a worksheet setting forth (i) Sellers  good faith reasonable estimate of the Prorated Amount for each Prorated Item (with respect to each Prorated Item, the    Estimated Prorated Amount   ), as well as, in each case, reasonable detail and supporting material regarding the computation thereof, and (ii) an amount equal to the sum of the Estimated Prorated Amounts (the    Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount   ).  In the event that, with respect to any Prorated Item, actual figures are not available as of the time of the calculation of the Estimated Prorated Amount, the Estimated Prorated Amount for such Prorated Item shall be a good faith reasonable estimate, including (as applicable) based upon the actual fee, cost or amount of the Prorated Item for the most recent preceding year (or appropriate period) for which an actual fee, cost or amount paid is available.  If the Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount is a positive number, the Base Purchase Price payable at Closing will be increased by an amount equal to such Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount.  If the Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount is a negative number, the Base Purchase Price payable at Closing will be decreased by an amount equal to the absolute value of such Estimated Proration Adjustment Amount. 
    
  (c)  As soon as either Party obtains Knowledge of the actual Prorated Amount with respect to any Prorated Item, it shall promptly notify the other Party of such Prorated Item and the availability of the actual Prorated Amount.  Within thirty (30) days of the date of the above notice by either Party with respect to such Prorated Item (the    Request Date   ), Buyer shall calculate (A) the Prorated Amount for such Prorated Item using the actual available amounts (the    Actual Prorated Amount   ), and (B) the absolute value of the difference between the Estimated  
  
   11 

Prorated Amount and the Actual Prorated Amount for such Prorated Item (the    Prorated Difference   ) and provide Sellers with such calculation, together with reasonable detail and supporting material regarding the computation thereof.  Subject to the provisions of   Section 2.4(d)   with respect to resolution of any dispute, (i) if the Actual Prorated Amount (whether a positive or a negative number) is greater than the Estimated Prorated Amount (whether a positive or a negative number) for such Prorated Item, Buyer shall pay an amount equal to the Prorated Difference to Sellers within ten (10) days after the later of the Request Date or the date of the resolution of any dispute pursuant to   Section 2.4(d)  , and (ii) if the Estimated Prorated Amount (whether a positive or a negative number) is greater than the Actual Prorated Amount (whether a positive or a negative number) for such Prorated Item, Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, an amount equal to the Prorated Difference to Buyer within ten (10) days after the later of the Request Date or the date of the resolution of any dispute pursuant to   Section 2.4(d)  .  Following the Closing, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate and provide each other, and, if applicable, the Independent Accounting Firm, with such documents and other records as may be reasonably requested in order to confirm all proration calculations made pursuant to this   Section 2.4  . 
    
  (d)  In the event any Party disagrees with the other Parties on the computation of the Actual Prorated Amount for any Prorated Item to be determined under this   Section 2.4  , such Party may provide a written notice of the disagreement to the other Parties identifying with specificity the subject of such disagreement, the basis for such disagreement and such Party s proposed revisions to resolve such disagreement, and Buyer and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their disagreement.  Should such negotiations not result in an agreement within twenty (20) days after delivery of such notice of disagreement, then the matter shall be submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm.  The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to Buyer and Sellers a written determination of the Actual Prorated Amount and the Prorated Difference with respect to the disputed item (such determination to include a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based solely on information provided to the Independent Accounting Firm by Buyer and Sellers) within thirty (30) days of the submission of the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties.  In resolving any disagreement, the Independent Accounting Firm may not assign any value to a disputed item greater than the greatest value claimed for such disputed item by any Party or lesser than the lowest value claimed for such disputed item by any Party.  All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this   Section 2.4(d)   will be allocated between Sellers and Buyer in inverse proportion as each shall prevail in respect of the dollar amount of disputed items so submitted (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm).

Excluded Asset or applicable invoice for an account payable in respect of an Excluded Liability, Buyer shall promptly deliver (or cause its Affiliate to deliver) such applicable payment (or a copy of such document) to such Seller.  With respect to any payment or invoice or other payment obligation, including any accounts payable, relating both to (a) an Acquired Asset and/or an Assumed Liability, on the one hand, and (B) an Excluded Asset and/or an Excluded Liability, on the other hand, such payment or payment obligation shall be prorated as of as of 12:00:01 a.m. (Eastern Prevailing Time) on the Closing Date (except if another allocation is expressly specified in this Agreement).

In the event that a Party (or its Affiliate) receives notice of an applicable account payable or similar payment obligation addressed to such Party (or its Affiliate) that represents a joint obligation of a Seller and Buyer under this   Section 2.10  , subject to compliance with the foregoing cooperation covenant to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances, such Party, in is sole discretion, may (or may cause its Affiliate) to pay in full the outstanding amount of such payment obligation for all Parties as necessary to avoid a payment default under the applicable Contract without prejudice to such Party s right to reimbursement of the allocable portion of such payment obligation from the other Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement (and in such case the other Party shall promptly reimburse the paying Party for such other Party s allocable share of the payment obligation in accordance with this   Section 2.10  ). 
    
  (c)  In the event any Party disagrees with respect to the proposed allocation of any payment or payment obligation under this   Section 2.10   in connection with a request for payment or reimbursement for an allocable share of any such payment or payment obligation, such Party may deliver a written notice of the disagreement to the other Parties identifying with specificity the subject of such disagreement, the basis for such disagreement and such Party s proposed allocation to resolve such disagreement.  The Parties shall endeavor in good faith to try to resolve all disagreements prior to any such written notice being delivered, and in all events no Party may deliver more than one (1) such written notice of disagreement within any rolling one-hundred and twenty (120) day period (  provided that  , a written notice of disagreement may contain disputes as to one or more related or unrelated allocations hereunder).  Should a written notice of disagreement be delivered under this   Section 2.10  , then Buyer and Sellers shall negotiate in good faith and attempt to resolve their disagreement and if such negotiations do not result in an agreement within thirty (30) days after delivery of such written notice, then any Party may submit the matter to the Independent Accounting Firm.  The Independent Accounting Firm will deliver to Buyer and Sellers a written determination of the allocation with respect to such disputed payment or payment obligation, as applicable (such determination to be based solely on information provided to the Independent Accounting Firm by Buyer and Sellers) within thirty (30) days of the submission of the dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, which determination will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties.  In resolving any disagreement, the Independent Accounting Firm may not allocate any payment or payment obligation in an amount greater than the greatest value claimed for such disputed allocation by any Party or lesser than the lowest value claimed for such disputed allocation by any Party.  All  
  
   15 

fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this   Section 2.10   will be allocated between Sellers and Buyer in inverse proportion as each shall prevail in respect of the dollar amount of disputed items so submitted (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm).

  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER 
    
  Buyer hereby represents and warrants to Sellers as of the date hereof and as of the Closing, except for those representations and warranties that are made as of a specific date or as disclosed in the Schedules (it being agreed that the disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of Schedules shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), as follows: 
  Section 4.1      Organization and Existence  .  Buyer is a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware, with all requisite power and authority required to enter into this Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents and consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.  Buyer is duly qualified or licensed to do business in each other jurisdiction where the actions required to be performed by it hereunder make such qualification or licensing necessary, except in those jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on Buyer s ability to perform its obligations hereunder. 
    
  Section 4.2      Authorization  .  The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are within Buyer s powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Buyer.  This Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents constitute (assuming the due execution and delivery by Sellers) a valid and legally binding obligation of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with their terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar Laws relating to or affecting creditors  rights generally and general equitable principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). 
    
  Section 4.3      Consents  .  Except for those Consents and Permits listed in Schedule 4.3, no Consent of any Governmental Entity which has not been obtained or made by Buyer is required for or in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents by Buyer, and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby, other than such Consents the failure of which to obtain or make would not materially impair or delay the ability of Buyer to effect the Closing. 
    
  Section 4.4      Noncontravention  .  The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the other Ancillary Documents by Buyer does not, and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby will not (i) contravene or violate any provision of the Organizational Documents of Buyer or (ii) subject to obtaining or making the  
  
   27 

Consents listed in Schedule 4.3, contravene or violate any provision of, or result in the termination or acceleration of, or entitle any party to accelerate any obligation or indebtedness under, any lease, Contract to which Buyer is a party or by which Buyer is bound, except, with respect to the foregoing clause (ii) only, to the extent that any such events would not materially impair or delay the ability of Buyer to effect the Closing. 
    
  Section 4.5      Legal Proceedings  .  Except as set forth on Schedule 4.5, there are no Claims pending or, to Buyer s Knowledge, threatened, against or otherwise relating to Buyer before any Governmental Entity or any arbitrator that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer s ability to perform its obligations hereunder or under any other Ancillary Document.  Buyer is not subject to any Order that prohibits the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Ancillary Document or would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer s ability to perform its obligations hereunder. 
    
  Section 4.6      Compliance with Laws  .  Buyer is not in violation of any Law, except for violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a material adverse effect on Buyer s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement. 
    
  Section 4.7      Brokers  .  Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has any liability or obligation to pay fees or commissions to any broker, finder or agent with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Sellers or their Affiliates could become liable or obliged. 
    
  Section 4.8      Financing; Available Funds  . 
    
  (a)  Buyer at the Closing will have all funds necessary for its payment of the Purchase Price in accordance with this Agreement and for all other actions necessary for Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement and perform its obligations hereunder.  Buyer understands that its obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the payment of all amounts when due) are not subject to the availability to Buyer of any financing (including from the Guarantor).  The Buyer Parent Guarantee is the legal, valid and binding obligations of each of the Guarantors.  Buyer represents and warrants that all funds paid to Sellers shall not have been derived from, or constitute, either directly or indirectly, the proceeds of any criminal activity under the anti-money laundering laws of the United States. 
    
  (b)  Buyer has delivered to Sellers a true, complete and correct copy of the executed debt commitment letter, together with each related fee letter (with customary redactions only with respect to fee amounts and the economic terms of the  market flex  provisions and nothing which would affect the amount or availability of the Debt Financing) and engagement letter, each in effect as of the date of this Agreement from the Debt Financing Sources (together, as they may be amended, modified or replaced in accordance with   Section 5.20(c)  , the    Debt Commitment Letter   ) to provide debt financing in an aggregate amount set forth therein and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (being collectively referred to, together with any alternative financing arranged in accordance with   Section 5.20  , as the    Debt Financing   ).  Buyer has delivered to Sellers a true, complete and correct copy of the executed equity  
  
   28 

commitment letters (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes, supplements and amendments thereto, the    Equity Financing Commitments   , and together with the Debt Commitment Letter, the    Financing Commitments   ), pursuant to which the applicable investor party thereto has committed, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, to invest in Buyer the cash amount set forth therein (the    Equity Financing   , and together with the Debt Financing, the    Financing   ) 
    
  (c)  As of the date of this Agreement, none of the Financing Commitments have been amended or modified, no amendment or modification to the Financing Commitments is contemplated, and the respective commitments contained in the Financing Commitments have not been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded in any respect and no such termination, reduction, withdrawal or rescission is contemplated.  There are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments delivered to Sellers pursuant to this   Section 4.8  .  Buyer has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees, amounts or expenses in connection with the Financing Commitments that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and Buyer is unaware of any fact or occurrence existing on the date hereof that would reasonably be expected to make any of the assumptions or any of the statements set forth in the Financing Commitments to be ineffective.  The Financing Commitments are in full force and effect and are the legal, valid, binding and enforceable obligations of Buyer and each of the other parties thereto, as the case may be.  There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount (or any portion) of the Financing, including any condition relating to the availability of the Debt Financing pursuant to any  flex  provision, other than as expressly set forth in the Financing Commitments.  No event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Buyer or any other party thereto under any of the Financing Commitments.  Buyer has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Financing will not be made available to Buyer on or prior to the Closing and Buyer is not aware of the existence of any fact or event as of the date hereof that would reasonably be expected to cause such conditions to funding not be satisfied on a timely basis and the Closing not to occur.  Buyer has not incurred any obligation, commitment, restriction or other liability of any kind, and is not contemplating or aware of any obligation, commitment, restriction or other liability of any kind, in either case which would impair or adversely affect such resources, funds or capabilities.  Each Equity Financing Commitment designates each Seller as an intended third party beneficiary thereof who may enforce the rights of Buyer pursuant to such Equity Financing Commitment as if each Seller was a party thereto. 
    
  Section 4.9      Regulatory Status  .  Buyer is not a  public utility  as defined in the FPA.  Schedule 4.9 identifies each of Buyer s  affiliates  (under and as defined in the FPA and the rules and regulations of FERC promulgated thereunder) that are  public utilities  as defined in the FPA and are subject to regulation by FERC as public utilities.  Each of Buyer s  affiliates  (under and as defined in the FPA and the rules and regulations of FERC promulgated thereunder) selling electric energy, capacity and certain ancillary services at wholesale subject to the jurisdiction of FERC under the FPA has been authorized by FERC to make wholesale sales of electric energy, capacity and/or certain ancillary services at market-based rates pursuant to Section 205 of the FPA, except for any such affiliate that owns one or more  qualifying  
  
   29 

facilities  as defined in the FERC rules and regulations promulgated under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended, that are entitled to exemption from regulation under Section 205 of the FPA.  Buyer is not subject to regulation as a  public utility  or  public service company  (or similar designation) with respect to its rates, securities issuances or capital structure by any state Governmental Entity. 
    
  Section 4.10        Legal Impediments  .  There are no facts relating to Buyer, any applicable Law or any agreement to which Buyer is a party that would disqualify Buyer from acquiring the Acquired Assets or assuming the Assumed Liabilities or that would prevent, delay or limit the ability of Buyer to effect the Closing. 
    
  Section 4.11      No Conflicting Contracts  .  Neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates is a party to any Contract to build, develop, acquire or operate any electric generation, or otherwise owns assets or is engaged in a business, that would reasonably be expected to impair or cause a material delay in any Governmental Entity s granting of a Consent, and neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates has any plans to enter into any such Contract, acquire any such assets or engage in any such business prior to the Closing Date. 
    
  Section 4.12      Investigation  .  Buyer is a sophisticated entity, is knowledgeable about the industry in which Sellers operate and the Acquired Assets, experienced in investments in such businesses and able to bear the economic risk associated with the purchase of the Acquired Assets and the assumption of the Assigned Contracts.  Buyer has such knowledge and experience as to be aware of the risks and uncertainties inherent in the purchase of the Acquired Assets and related contractual rights and obligations of the type contemplated in this Agreement, as well as the knowledge of each Seller and its operation of the Acquired Assets in particular, and has independently, based on such information, made its own analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Buyer had access to the Books and Records and the Facilities for purposes of conducting its due diligence investigation of the Acquired Assets. 
    
  Section 4.13      Disclaimer Regarding Projections  .  Buyer may be in possession of certain plans, projections and other forecasts regarding the Acquired Assets, the Assumed Liabilities and the Assigned Contracts (the  Projections ).  Buyer acknowledges that there are substantial uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such Projections, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, that Buyer is making its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Projections so furnished to it.  Accordingly, Buyer acknowledges that without limiting the generality of this Section 4.13, neither Sellers nor any of their respective Affiliates has made any representation or warranty with respect to such Projections and other forecasts and plans.  
    
  Section 4.14      No Additional Representations  .  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Article IV or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that no Seller, nor any of their Affiliates, nor any of their respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders, partners, members, agents or Representatives, has made or is making any representation or warranty whatsoever, express or implied (and Buyer has not relied on any representation, warranty or statement of any kind by any Seller nor any of their Affiliates) beyond those expressly given in Article III, including any implied warranty or representation as to condition, merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose or trade as to any of the Acquired Assets.

True, correct and complete copies of all such Support Obligations as of the date of this Agreement have been made available to Buyer.

  (ii)  Buyer shall indemnify Sellers and any of their Affiliates from and against any liabilities, losses and reasonable costs or expenses (including any issuance, amendment or maintenance fees and expenses) incurred by Sellers and any such Affiliate in connection with each Continuing Support Obligation (including reimbursement immediately following demand therefor with respect to any demand or draw upon, or withdrawal from, any Continuing Support Obligation);

  (B)  The fee payable by Buyer pursuant to the foregoing clause (A) of   Section 5.3(d)(v)   shall be determined as follows:  On the last Business Day of the first three (3) month period following the Closing Date, the fee shall be calculated at a rate of one and one-quarter percent (1.25%) (on a per annum basis) on the amount under the heading  Subject Amount  on   Schedule 5.3(a)   with respect to each Continuing Support Obligation remaining outstanding as of such date, and the rate of such fee shall increase by an additional one-half percent (0.5%) (on a per annum basis) on the last Business Day of each subsequent three (3) month period after such initial three (3) month period after the Closing Date with respect to any such Continuing Support Obligation that remains outstanding, up to a maximum rate of three and one-quarter percent (3.25%) (on a per annum basis);   provided that   if the rate for calculating any fee payable under this   Section 
  
   38 

5.3(d)(v)   would exceed the highest rate permitted under applicable Law, then,   ipso facto  , the rate shall be automatically reduced to the maximum lawful rate. 
    
  (e)  If any claim is made against a Continuing Support Obligation, or if a Continuing Support Obligation is drawn upon, as applicable, on or after the Closing Date, upon receipt of written notice thereof from a Seller, Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to a Seller or its designee the amount so claimed or drawn within five (5) Business Days after the date of such written notice.

  (f)  During the Interim Period, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall have the right to contact and have discussions with each beneficiary of a Support Obligation in order to satisfy its obligations under this   Section 5.3  ;   provided, however  , that Buyer shall give Sellers not less than five (5) Business Days  prior notice before making any such contact, and Sellers shall have the right to have Sellers  Representatives present via telephone or in person, as applicable, during any such contact or discussion, and Buyer shall cause such Representatives to comply with all reasonable procedures and protocols regarding such contacts and discussions that may be established by Seller.

Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer s efforts shall include, to the extent applicable, (i) offering to replace any Support Obligations maintained by any Affiliate of Sellers in favor of a Counterparty to the extent and in the manner set forth in   Section 5.3   and in the case of a Assigned Contract with respect to which neither a Seller nor any of its Affiliates has posted or maintains any Support Obligation, Buyer shall comply with all requirements under any such Assigned Contract or commercially reasonable requests by a Counterparty thereto, in either case, to post or maintain credit support as security for the performance of its obligations as assignee thereof, to the extent and in the manner set forth in   Section 5.3  , (ii) where indicated on   Schedule 2.1(a)(v)  , entering into a new or replacement Master Agreement with any such Counterparty, on substantially the same terms in the aggregate as those in place on the date hereof in a Master Agreement between a Seller and such Counterparty, if necessary for the assignment to Buyer of one or more purchase orders, releases or similar Contracts (or portion thereof) that represent Assigned Contracts subject to such Master Agreement with a Seller and (iii) to the extent that any Assigned Contracts relate to natural gas transportation on a pipeline regulated by FERC, Sellers  obligations under this   Section 5.4(a)   are conditioned upon Sellers successfully releasing its capacity permanently to Buyer (or its Affiliate) and being relieved of all payment obligations under each such Assigned Contract pursuant to the terms of the applicable FERC gas tariff (each  
  
   39 

of Sellers and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to achieve any such permanent releases of capacity).  For the avoidance of doubt, it is specifically acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that (A) subject to   Section 5.3  , none of Buyer, Sellers or their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to incur, pay, reimburse or provide any liability, compensation, consideration or charge, or commence or be a plaintiff in any litigation or otherwise agree to any contractual modification, in each case, to obtain the written Consent of any Counterparty to the assignment and assumption of any Assigned Contract and (B) with respect to any Assigned Contracts to which Buyer is the Counterparty, Buyer hereby consents to the assignment of such Assigned Contracts by the applicable Seller or its Affiliates to Buyer. 
    
  (b)  If Buyer and Sellers are unable to obtain any required Consent of a Counterparty to the assignment of any Assigned Contract (other than any Specified Material Contract) pursuant to   Section 5.4(a)   or to implement the actions set forth on   Schedule 5.4(a)   with respect to any Shared Contract or Specified Material Contract; then any such Assigned Contracts shall not be assigned at Closing and such Shared Contracts and Specified Material Contracts shall not be assumed (or transferred through replacement or other action specified on   Schedule 5.4(a)  ) (such non-assigned Contracts, the    Non-Assigned Contracts   ), and Buyer and Sellers shall continue for a period of six (6) months after Closing to comply with their obligations under   Section 5.4(a)   to the extent and for so long as the applicable Non-Assigned Contract shall not have been assigned to Buyer.  During the Interim Period and thereafter prior to the expiration of such six (6) month period, Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts (but in no event in contravention of any rights or obligations pursuant to such Contract or otherwise in violation of Law) to provide, and Buyer shall accept, one or more back-to-back Contracts or other arrangements (which, once entered, may extend beyond such six (6) month period regardless of the latter expiration of such period) that would (i) place each of Buyer and the applicable Seller in a substantially similar position (except in the case of Buyer, in respect of any Excluded Liabilities) and (ii) provide Buyer substantially similar rights, privileges, liabilities, benefits and obligations, in each case, as if such Non-Assigned Contract had been assigned to Buyer in accordance with   Section 2.1(c)(ii)   as of the Closing.  Upon obtaining the requisite third-party Consents thereto, such Assigned Contract shall promptly be transferred and assigned to Buyer hereunder, or such actions with respect to such Shared Contract or Specified Material Contract as set forth in   Schedule 5.4(a)   shall be implemented by the Parties, in each case at no additional cost to Buyer and with such effect as if transferred (or implemented) as of the Closing.  For the avoidance of doubt, it is specifically acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that subject to   Section 5.3  , none of Buyer, Sellers or their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to incur, pay, reimburse or provide any liability, compensation, consideration or charge, or commence or be a plaintiff in any litigation or otherwise agree to any contractual modification, in each case, to enter into any back-to-back Contracts or other arrangements described in the foregoing sentence.

For the avoidance of doubt, it is specifically acknowledged and agreed by the Parties that Sellers and their Affiliates shall not be obligated to incur, pay,  
  
   40 

reimburse or provide any liability, compensation, consideration or charge, or commence or be a plaintiff in any litigation, in each case to obtaining such new Master Agreement.

In the event that, as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Sellers or their Affiliates or their applicable Representatives and applicable contractors, the Gavin Landfill Project is not complete by the time that the existing landfill at Gavin no longer has capacity to accept Gavin s coal combustion residual sold waste, Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for any costs or expenses incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates arising from or relating to the off-site disposal of such wastes. Buyer shall (and shall cause its Affiliate and its and their applicable Representatives, and any applicable contractors thereof at the site) to ensure that Sellers (and their Affiliates and its and their Representatives, and any applicable contractors thereof at the site) have reasonable access at all times (twenty four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week) to the site of all applicable work at the Gavin Landfill Project, including the area of the Gavin Landfill Project, construction offices, and storm water and NPDES permit tie in points as reasonably necessary for such work;   provided that   (v) Sellers agree to provide reasonable advance notice to Buyer of any additional investigative or remedial activities planned at the site beyond the currently proposed scope of the Gavin Landfill Project and to provide Buyer with copies of all reports, assessments or material correspondence submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection therewith, (w) Sellers (and their Affiliates and its and their Representatives, and any applicable contractors thereof at the site) maintain appropriate insurance coverage for their activities at the Gavin Landfill Project, including but not limited to Worker s Compensation insurance, Comprehensive General Liability insurance, and Professional Liability insurance, and such insurance lists Buyer as an additional insured on such policies, (x) Buyer may impose reasonable restrictions and requirements for safety purposes that are not more stringent than those applicable to Buyer, its Affiliates and their applicable contractors at the site, (y) such access may be restricted as required to comply with applicable Laws, Permits, or Orders, and (z) such access does not unreasonably interfere with the Buyer s continued operations and activities at Gavin in excess of the interference which would reasonably be expected as the result of an independent third party contractor performing similar services.  Buyer agrees and acknowledges that Sellers  project personnel and resources may be used for both or either of the SRFAP Closure and Gavin Landfill Project to complete such projects and that any soil and excess materials generated by the Gavin Landfill Project may be used for the SRFAP Closure project at no charge or cost to Generation Resources (other than any incremental transportation or other removal costs resulting from such use for the SRFAP Closure project, which shall be Generation Resources  sole cost and expense).  For the avoidance of doubt, any pre-Closing costs and expenses incurred by Sellers in connection with the Gavin Landfill Project on or after January 1, 2017 shall be taken into consideration in the calculation of the Capital Expenditures Adjustment Amount.

  Section 7.2      Indemnification by Sellers. 
    
  (a)  From and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this   Article VII  , Sellers agree to indemnify Buyer and its Affiliates and their officers, directors and employees (collectively, the    Indemnified Buyer Entities   ) and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered, paid or incurred by such Indemnified Buyer Entity and caused by (i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties made by any Seller to Buyer in this Agreement, (ii) any breach by any Seller of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or (iii) any Excluded Liability;   provided, however   that for purposes of determining if an indemnifiable breach has occurred under   Section 7.2(a)(i)   and for purposes of determining the amount of Damages suffered from such breach, the Parties shall exclude all qualifications as to materiality, including Material Adverse Effect, except as used in   Section 3.5   or in the defined term  Material Contract  (or in the definition of such term).

  (iii)  only with respect to claims for indemnification under   Section 7.2(a)(i)   made on or before the expiration of the survival period pursuant to   Section 7.1   for the applicable representation or warranty. 
  
   68 

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this   Section 7.2   (other than the immediately following sentence of this   Section 7.2(c)  ), in no event shall the Indemnified Buyer Entities be entitled to aggregate Damages pursuant to   Section 7.2(a)(i)   in excess of the amount of ten percent (10%) of the Base Purchase Price (the    Cap   ), in the aggregate.  Notwithstanding anything in this   Section 7.2   to the contrary, the De Minimis Claim threshold, the Deductible and the Cap shall not apply to any indemnification obligation of Sellers pursuant to   Section 7.2(a)(i)   arising out of or resulting from any breach of any Designated Representation or the representations and warranties contained in   Section 3.9(a)   (Title to Acquired Assets) or   Section 3.16   (Taxes);   provided, however  , that Sellers shall not be required to indemnify the Indemnified Buyer Entities pursuant to   Section 7.2(a)(i)   for Damages in excess of the Base Purchase Price.

  Section 7.3      Indemnification by Buyer. 
    
  (a)  From and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this   Article VII  , Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify each Seller and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors and employees (collectively, the    Indemnified Seller Entities   ) and to hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered, paid or incurred by such Indemnified Seller Entity and caused by (i) any breach of any of the representations and warranties made by Buyer to Sellers in this Agreement, (ii) any breach by Buyer of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or (iii) any Assumed Liability.

  Section 7.4      Indemnification Procedures. 
    
  (a)  If an Indemnified Buyer Entity or an Indemnified Seller Entity (each, an    Indemnified Entity   ) believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance exists that has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under   Article VII   or   Section 5.1(c)   (whether or not the amount of Damages relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified Entity shall assert its claim for indemnification by giving written notice thereof (a    Claim Notice   ) to the party from which indemnification is sought (the    Indemnifying Party   ) (i) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such claim for indemnification is, or relates to, a claim, suit, action or proceeding brought by a Person not a party to this Agreement or affiliated with any such party (a    Third Party   ), within ten (10) Business Days following receipt of notice of such Claim by such Indemnified Entity, or (ii) if the event or occurrence giving rise to such action or claim for indemnification is not, or does not relate to, a Claim brought by a Third Party, within thirty (30) days after the discovery by the Indemnified Entity of the circumstances giving rise to such Claim for indemnity.  Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim in reasonable  
  
   69 

detail.  The failure or delay by the Indemnified Entity to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any indemnification obligation hereunder except to the extent that the defense of such Claim is materially prejudiced by such failure to give such notice. 
    
  (b)  If any claim or demand by an Indemnified Entity under this   Article VII   or   Section 5.1(c)  ,   Section 5.3(d)(ii)   or   Section 5.14(n)   relates to a claim filed or made against an Indemnified Entity by a Third Party, the Indemnifying Party may elect at any time to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of such claim or to defend such claim, in each case at its sole cost and expense (subject to the last sentence of   Section 7.4(a)  ) and with its own counsel, if (i) the Indemnifying Party provides written notice to the Indemnified Entity that the Indemnifying Party intends to undertake such defense and (ii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Entity.  If the Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Entity reasonably determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate because of a conflict of interest, the Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to retain separate counsel as required by the applicable rules of professional conduct (which counsel must be reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Entity and the expense of which shall be included in the calculation of any Damages to the Indemnified Entity in respect of such Third Party Claim) and to control the defense of the Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the Indemnified Entity s right to control the defense of the Third-Party Claim shall be limited to that portion of the Third-Party Claim that is a conflict of interest. 
    
  (c)  Except with the prior written consent of the Indemnified Entity, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no Indemnifying Party shall settle or compromise any Third Party Claim or permit a default judgment or consent to an entry of judgment unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i) relates solely to money damages, (ii) provides for a full, unconditional and irrevocable release of the Indemnified Entity with respect to the Claim(s) being settled and (iii) does not contain any admission or finding of wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnified Entity.  If, within thirty (30) days of receipt from an Indemnified Entity of any Claim Notice with respect to a Third Party Claim the Indemnifying Party does not elect to defend such Third Party Claim, such Indemnified Entity may (subject to the Indemnifying Party s continuing right of election in subpart (b) of this   Section 7.4  ), at its option, defend, settle or otherwise compromise or pay such Claim;   provided that   any such settlement or compromise shall be permitted hereunder only with the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Unless and until the Indemnifying Party makes an election in accordance with this   Section 7.4   to defend, settle or compromise such Claim (and, following such time, subject to the last sentence of   Section 7.4(b)  ), all of the Indemnified Entity s reasonable costs and expenses arising out of the defense, settlement or compromise of any such Claim shall be Damages subject to indemnification hereunder to the extent provided herein.  Each Indemnified Entity shall make available to the Indemnifying Party all information reasonably available to such Indemnified Entity relating to such Claim (other than materials, if any, subject to attorney-client or attorney-work product privilege).  In addition, the Parties shall render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such Claim.  The Party in charge of the defense shall keep the other Parties fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with respect thereto.  If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend any such Claim, then the Indemnified Entity shall be entitled to participate in such defense with separate counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying  
  
   70 

Party, at such Indemnified Entity s sole cost and expense. In the event the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of (or otherwise elects to negotiate or settle or compromise) a Claim as described above, the Indemnified Entity shall reimburse the Indemnifying Party for all costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in connection with such defense (or negotiation, settlement or compromise) to the extent, if applicable, that such costs and expenses do not exceed the amount of the remaining Deductible. 
    
  Section 7.5        General. 
    
  (a)  Each Indemnified Entity shall be obligated in connection with any Claim for indemnification under this   Article VII   or   Section 5.1(c)  ,   Section 5.3(d)(ii)   or   Section 5.14(n)   to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any insurance proceeds available to such Indemnified Entity with regard to the applicable Claims or to recover any amounts to which it may be entitled in respect of the applicable Claims pursuant to contractual and other indemnification rights that the Indemnified Entity may have against Third Parties.  The amount which the Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to any Indemnified Entity pursuant to this   Article VII   or   Section 5.1(c)  ,   Section 5.3(d)(ii)   or   Section 5.14(n)   shall be reduced (retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance proceeds actually recovered by or on behalf of such Indemnified Entity or any of its Affiliates in reduction of the related Damages.  If an Indemnified Entity or any of its Affiliates shall have received the payment required by this Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in respect of Damages and shall subsequently receive insurance proceeds or other amounts in respect of such Damages, then such Indemnified Entity or Affiliate, as the case may be, shall promptly repay to the Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds or other amounts actually received to the extent such amount would give rise to a double recovery by such Indemnified Entity. 
    
  (b)  Subject to   Section 7.5(a)  , each Indemnified Entity shall be obligated in connection with any claim for indemnification under this   Article VII   to, and shall cause their Affiliates and respective Representatives to, take all reasonable actions to avoid, minimize and mitigate Damages that would otherwise be subject to indemnification under   Section 7.2  , including not undertaking any corrective action, investigation, monitoring or remediation of Hazardous Substances in soil or groundwater, except for such corrective action, investigation, monitoring or remediation that is (i) required under applicable Environmental Laws or directed by a Governmental Entity, (ii) conducted in connection with the unrelated construction or expansion of improvements at any Real Property, to the extent consistent with Good Utility Practice, or (iii) reasonably necessary to investigate facts or conditions identified or observed that indicate an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment.  In addition to any other limitations on indemnification that may apply, with respect to any Claim for indemnification that any of the Indemnified Buyer Entities may assert regarding Environmental Laws or Hazardous Substances, Sellers shall not have any obligation with respect to such Claim to the extent the Damages for which indemnification are sought (x) relate to a breach of obligations under this   Section 7.5(b)  , (y) arise out of any action to meet a cleanup or remedial standard under Environmental Law that is more stringent or costly than the standard applicable as of the Closing Date for the continued use of the relevant property or facility as it was used as of the Closing Date, or (z) are ordinary costs of any post-Closing decommissioning, construction, demolition or renovation of any Acquired Asset that would be reasonably expected to be incurred regardless of such cleanup or remediation. 
  
   71 

(c)  Subject to the rights of any insurance carriers, the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to any right of action that the Indemnified Entity may have against any other Person (other than any insurance carriers) with respect to any matter giving rise to a Claim for indemnification hereunder. 
    
  (d)  The indemnification provided in this   Article VII   shall be the exclusive post-Closing remedy available to any Party hereto with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or otherwise in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement (including   Section 7.7(a)   and   Section 9.13  ). 
    
  (e)  If any fact, circumstance or condition forming a basis for a Claim for indemnification under this   Article VII   shall overlap with any fact, circumstance, condition, agreement or event forming the basis of any other Claim for indemnification under this   Article VII  , there shall be no duplication in the calculation of the amount of the Damages.  In addition, neither Seller nor Buyer shall have any Liability under this   Article VII   for Damages relating to matters to the extent included in the calculation of the Capital Expenditures Adjustment Amount (other than the failure to pay amounts (if any) that become due and payable by Sellers pursuant to   Section 2.2  ) in accordance with the terms of   Section 2.2  . 
    
  (f)  An Indemnifying Party shall not be required to indemnify an Indemnified Entity to the extent of any Damages that a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator shall have determined by final, non-appealable judgment to have resulted from the fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Indemnified Entity seeking indemnification or its officers, directors, employees or Affiliates. 
    
  (g)  The Parties agree to treat all payments made by or deemed to be made by a Party under this   Article VII   as adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

  (a)  If this Agreement is terminated (i) by Sellers pursuant to   Section 8.1(e) or Section 8.1(c)   ,(ii) by Buyer or Sellers pursuant to   Section 8.1(a)   if, at the time of such termination, Sellers would have been entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to   Section 8.1(e)  , then Buyer shall pay to the Sellers a fee in an amount equal to five and one half percent (5.5%) of the Base Purchase Price (the    Reverse Termination Fee   ) in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the Sellers.  The Reverse Termination Fee shall be paid no later than three (3) Business Days after any such notice of termination of this Agreement.  If Buyer fails to promptly pay the Reverse Termination Fee when due pursuant to this   Section 8.3  , then interest shall accrue on the amount of the Reverse Termination Fee from the date such payment was required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of payment at a rate per annum equal to four percent (4%)   plus   the prime rate as published in the  
  
   76 

Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition   in effect from time to time during such period.

  (b)  The Parties agree that the Reverse Termination Fee (together with the interest obligations and cost and expense reimbursement obligations set forth in   Sections 5.1(c)  ,   5.17   and   8.3(a)  ) shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of Sellers against Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Guarantor), any Debt Financing Source or any director or indirect, former, current or future, general or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees, agents, advisors, representatives, successors or assigns of any of the foregoing (each a    Buyer Related Party   ), for any Damages incurred by Sellers and their Affiliates in the circumstances in which a Reverse Termination Fee is payable;   provided, however  , that subject to the foregoing and the Liability Limitation, nothing in this   Section 8.3(b)   shall be deemed to release Buyer from any other Damages incurred by Sellers and their Affiliates for any breach by Buyer of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth herein in circumstances in which the Reverse Termination Fee is not payable, in which case Sellers shall be entitled to pursue all remedies available at Law or in equity, including equitable relief, damages for the benefit of the bargain lost by the Sellers (taking into consideration relevant matters, including potentially the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement, relying on this Agreement and expecting the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).  The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Buyer Related Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of this   Section 8.3   and that in no event shall Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates be entitled to both specific performance pursuant to   Section 9.13   and the Reverse Termination Fee.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers acknowledge and agree that other than pursuant to the Buyer Parent Guarantee, no Buyer Related Party shall have any personal liability to Sellers or any of their Affiliates or any other Person as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation of Buyer in this Agreement.   
    
  (c)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event the Closing is not consummated, the maximum aggregate liability of the Buyer Related Parties under or in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be limited to five and one half percent (5.5%) of the Base Purchase Price in addition to any interest or expense reimbursement and indemnification obligations contained in   Sections 5.1(c)  ,   5.17   and   8.3   (the    Liability Limitation   ), and in no event shall Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates seek or be entitled to multiple, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental, consequential or indirect damages against any Buyer Related Party, or any recovery, judgment or damages of any kind against any Buyer Related Party in excess of the Liability Limitation (it being agreed and understood for the avoidance of doubt that under no circumstances shall any Debt Financing Source have any Liability in respect of the Reverse Termination Fee or any other Liability to Sellers or any of their Affiliates arising hereunder or in connection herewith).  Sellers acknowledge, covenant and agree that neither of Sellers nor any of their Affiliates has and shall have a right of recovery against, and no Liability shall attach to, including in each case with respect to any actual or claimed loss or damages of any kind of the Sellers or any of their subsidiaries, Affiliates, representatives or stockholders or any other Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of the Sellers, any of the Buyer Related Parties (other than Sellers  right to  
  
   77 

recover against Buyer to the extent provided in this Agreement and against the  Guarantors to the extent provided in the Buyer Parent Guarantee), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited partnership or limited liability company veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Buyer, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable Law, through a claim based in tort, contract, statute or otherwise.

  (3) the reduction of the Executive s base salary as in effect on the date of the Change In Control; 

3 

(4) the taking of any action by AEPSC (including the elimination of a plan without providing substitutes therefor, the reduction of the Executive s awards thereunder or failure to continue the Executive s participation therein) that would substantially diminish the aggregate projected value of the Executive s awards or benefits under AEPSC s benefit plans or policies in which the Executive was participating at the time of the Change In Control; provided, however, that the diminishment of such awards or benefits that apply to other groups of employees of AEPSC in addition to Executives covered by this or a similar agreement shall be disregarded; 
    
  (5) a failure by AEPSC or the Corporation to obtain from any successor the assent to this Agreement contemplated by Article IV hereof; or 
    
  (6) the relocation, without the Executive s prior approval, of the office at which the Executive is to perform services on behalf of AEPSC to a location more than fifty (50) miles from its location immediately prior to the Change In Control. 
    
  Any circumstance described in this Article I(m) shall constitute Good Reason even if such circumstance would not constitute a breach by AEPSC of the terms of an employment agreement between AEPSC and the Executive in effect on the date of the Change In Control.  However, such circumstance shall not constitute Good Reason unless (i) within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such circumstance, the Executive shall have given AEPSC written notice of such circumstance, and (ii) AEPSC shall have failed to remedy such circumstance within thirty (30) days after its receipt of such notice.  Such written notice to be provided by the Executive to AEPSC shall specify (A) the effective date for the Executive s proposed Termination of employment (provided that such effective date may not precede the expiration of the period for AEPSC s opportunity to remedy), (B) reasonable detail of the facts and circumstances claimed to provide the basis for Termination, and (C) the Executive s belief that such facts and circumstance would constitute Good Reason for purposes of this Agreement.

In addition, a Qualifying Termination shall be deemed to have occurred if, prior to a Change In Control, the Executive s employment was Terminated during the term of this Agreement (A) by AEPSC without Cause, or (B) by the Executive based on events or circumstances that would constitute Good Reason if a Change in Control had occurred, in either case, (x) at the request of a person who has entered into an agreement with AEPSC or the Corporation, the consummation of which would constitute a Change In Control or (y) otherwise in connection with, as a result of or in anticipation of a Change In Control.  For purposes of this Article I(o), (1) the mere act of approving a Change In Control agreement shall not in and of itself be deemed to constitute an event or circumstance in anticipation of a Change In Control, and (2) if an Executive s level of services decreases to 50% or less of the average level of service performed during the previous 36-month period but does not completely end, such decrease shall not, of itself, be considered a Qualifying Termination, but may, under appropriate circumstance be taken into account in determining whether the Executive has Good Reason for Terminating employment, provided that if the Executive fails to establish that such decrease constitutes Good Reason for purposes of this Agreement, any subsequent termination of the Executive s employment shall not be considered a Qualifying Termination.

  (q)   Target Annual Incentive  shall mean the award that the Executive would have received under the annual incentive compensation plan applicable to such Executive for the year in which the Executive s Termination occurs, if one hundred percent (100%) of the annual target award has been earned.

  (r)   Taxable Year  shall mean the taxable year of the Executive for federal income tax purposes, unless the context clearly indicates that the taxable year of a different taxpayer was intended.  
    
  (s)   Termination  means those circumstances considered to be a separation from service, determined in a manner consistent with the written policies adopted by the HR  
  
   5 

Committee of the Corporation from time to time to the extent such policies are consistent with the requirements imposed under Code Section 409A(a)(2)(A)(i). 
    
  (t)   Triggering Event  shall mean the event that triggered the Qualifying Termination (i.e., the Termination of the Executive s employment or, if the Qualifying Termination is specified in Article I(o)(A) or (B), the Change in Control). 

ARTICLE II 
  TERM OF AGREEMENT 
    
  2.1        The initial term of this Agreement shall be for the period beginning on the Commencement Date and ending on the December 31 immediately following the Commencement Date.  The term of this Agreement shall automatically be extended for an additional Calendar Year on the first Anniversary Date immediately following the initial term of this Agreement without further action by AEPSC, and shall be automatically extended for an additional Calendar Year on each succeeding Anniversary Date, unless AEPSC shall have served notice upon the Executive at least thirty (30) days prior to such Anniversary Date of AEPSC s intention that this Agreement shall not be extended, provided, however, that if a Change In Control of the Corporation shall occur during the term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall terminate two years after the date the Change In Control is completed. 
    
  2.2        If an employee is designated as an Executive after the Commencement Date or after an Anniversary Date, the initial term of this Agreement shall be for the period beginning on the date the employee is designated as an Executive and ending on the December 31 immediately following. 
    
  2.3        Notwithstanding Section 2.1, the term of this Agreement shall end upon any Termination of the Executive s employment that is other than a Qualifying Termination in connection with a Change In Control of the Corporation.  For example, this Agreement shall terminate if the Executive s position is eliminated and the Executive s employment is Terminated, other than in connection with a Change In Control of the Corporation, (i) due to a downsizing, consolidation or restructuring of AEPSC or of any other subsidiary of the Corporation     or (ii) due to the sale, disposition or divestiture of all or a portion of AEPSC or of any other subsidiary of the Corporation. 

ARTICLE III 
  COMPENSATION UPON A QUALIFYING TERMINATION IN CONNECTION  
  WITH A CHANGE IN CONTROL  
    
  3.1        Except as otherwise provided in Section 3.3, upon a Qualifying Termination, the Executive shall be under no further obligation to perform services for AEPSC and shall be entitled to receive the following payments and benefits: 

6 

(a) 
    As soon as practicable following the Executive s date of Termination, AEPSC shall make a lump sum cash payment to the Executive in an amount equal to the sum of (1) the Executive s Annual Salary through the date of Termination to the extent not theretofore paid, (2) the product of (x) the current plan year s Target Annual Incentive and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such calendar year through the date of Termination, and the denominator of which is 365, except that annual incentive plans which do not have predetermined annual target awards for participants shall have their pro-rated incentive compensation award for the current plan year paid as soon as practicable, and (3) any accrued vacation pay that otherwise would be available upon the Executive s Termination of employment with AEPSC, in each case to the extent not theretofore paid and in full satisfaction of the rights of the Executive thereto; provided, however, in the case of a Qualifying Termination in the circumstances specified in Article I(o)(B), payment of the amount described in subsection (2) of this Section 3.1(a) shall not be made until immediately after the Change in Control event or circumstance; and 
       
           (b) 
    If the Executive timely satisfies the conditions set forth in Section 3.3, AEPSC shall make a lump sum cash payment to the Executive in an amount equal to the CIC Multiple times the Executive s Annual Compensation. If the Qualifying Termination is specified in Article I(o) (A) or (B), no such lump sum payment shall be made unless and until the Change in Control related to the Qualifying Termination shall have occurred.  If any of the periods specified for timely satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 3.3 shall end in a Taxable Year that is different from the Taxable Year of the Triggering Event, the lump sum payment specified in this paragraph (b) shall not be made until the Taxable Year in which such period ends, provided that such payment shall be made no later than the 15   th    day of the third month of that later Taxable Year. 
       
    3.2        The Executive shall be entitled to such outplacement services and other non-cash severance or separation benefits as may then be available under the terms of a plan or agreement to groups of employees of AEPSC in addition to Executives who are covered under the terms of this or a similar agreement.  See also section 3.3(b).  To the extent any benefits described in this Article III, Section 3.2 cannot be provided pursuant to the appropriate plan or program maintained by AEPSC, AEPSC shall provide such benefits outside such plan or program at no additional cost to the Executive. 
    
  3.3        Notwithstanding the foregoing,  
    
           (a) 
    The severance payments and benefits provided under Sections 3.1(a)(2), 3.1(b), and 3.2 hereof shall be conditioned upon the Executive executing a release within the period specified therein, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the Triggering Event, in the form established by the  
     
   7 

Corporation or by AEPSC, releasing the Corporation, AEPSC and their shareholders, partners, officers, directors, employees and agents from any and all claims and from any and all causes of action of kind or character, including but not limited to all claims or causes of action arising out of Executive s employment with the Corporation or AEPSC or the termination of such employment. 
    
           (b) 
    The severance payments and benefits provided under Sections 3.1(a)(2), 3.1(b), and 3.2 hereof shall be subject to, and conditioned upon, the timely waiver of any other cash severance payment or other benefits provided by AEPSC pursuant to any other severance agreement between AEPSC and the Executive.  Such waiver shall not be considered timely unless received by AEPSC within sixty (60) days after the Triggering Event. No amount shall be payable under this Agreement to, or on behalf of the Executive, if the Executive elects benefits under any other cash severance plan or program, or any other special pay arrangement with respect to the termination of the Executive s employment. 
       
           (c)  
    (1)        The Executive agrees that at all times following Termination, the Executive will not, without the prior written consent of AEPSC or the Corporation, disclose to any person, firm or corporation any  confidential information,  of AEPSC or the Corporation which is now known to the Executive or which hereafter may become known to the Executive as a result of the Executive s employment or association with AEPSC or the Corporation, unless such disclosure is required under the terms of a valid and effective subpoena or order issued by a court or governmental body; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not prohibit or impede the Executive from reporting an act or event, that the Executive in good faith believes is a violation of law, to a relevant law-enforcement agency (such as a federal, state or local law enforcement agency or official), or to a federal, state or local government agency, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or the Department of Labor, or from cooperating in an investigation conducted by or communicating with such a government agency, or otherwise making disclosures to such an agency, in each case, that are protected under federal, state or local whistleblower laws (Permissible Disclosures ).  It is recognized that damages in the event of breach of this Section 3.3(c) by the Executive would be difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain, and it is therefore agreed that AEPSC and the Corporation, in addition to and without limiting any other remedy or right that AEPSC or the Corporation may have, shall have the right to an injunction or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction, enjoining any such breach, and the Executive hereby waives any and all defenses the Executive may have on the ground of lack of jurisdiction or competence of the court to grant such  
     
   8 

an injunction or other equitable relief.  The existence of this right shall not preclude AEPSC or the Corporation from pursuing any other rights or remedies at law or in equity which AEPSC or the Corporation may have. 
       
  (2)        Pursuant to the federal Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 ( DTSA ): (a)  no individual will be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for the disclosure of a trade secret that is made: (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney; and made solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) in a complaint or other document filed in a lawsuit or other proceeding, if such filing is made under seal so that it is not made public; and (b) an individual who is pursuing a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law may disclose trade secret information to the attorney of the individual and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual (i) files any document that contains or reflects the trade secret under seal; and (ii) does not disclose any trade secret except as permitted by court order.  
    
  (3)        The Executive does not need the prior authorization of (or to give notice to) AEPSC or the Corporation regarding any such Permissible Disclosures or disclosures protected by the DTSA.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no provision in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted as authorization from AEPSC or the Corporation for the Executive to disclose any information covered by the attorney-client or attorney work product privileges of AEPSC or the Corporation or a waiver or any such privilege. 
    
  (4)         Confidential information  shall mean any confidential, propriety and or trade secret information, including, but not limited to, concepts, ideas, information and materials relating to AEPSC or the Corporation, client records, client lists, economic and financial analysis, financial data, customer contracts, marketing plans, notes, memoranda, lists, books, correspondence, manuals, reports or research, whether developed by AEPSC or the Corporation or developed by the Executive acting alone or jointly with AEPSC or the Corporation while the Executive was employed by AEPSC. Confidential information does not include information which becomes publicly disseminated by means other than a breach of this Section 3.3(c). 
    
  3.4        The obligations of AEPSC to pay the benefits described in Sections 3.1, and 3.2 shall, subject to Section 3.3, be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which AEPSC may have against the Executive; provided, however, AEPSC shall comply with and enforce obligations of AEPSC or the Executive under law determined by AEPSC to be applicable, including any withholding  
  
   9 

in order to comply with a court order.  In no event shall the Executive be obligated to seek other employment or take any other action by way of mitigation of the amounts payable to the Executive under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor shall the amount of any payment hereunder be reduced by any compensation earned by the Executive as a result of employment by another employer. 
    
  3.5        Executive alone shall be liable for the payment of any and all tax cost, incremental or otherwise, incurred by the Executive in connection with the provision of any benefits described in this Agreement.  No provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted to provide for the gross-up or other mitigation of any amount payable or benefit provided to the Executive under the terms of this Agreement as a result of such taxes. 
    
  3.6        Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if the Executive is a  specified employee  (as determined with respect AEPSC for purposes of Code Section 409A), the Executive shall not be entitled to any payments of amounts determined to be nonqualified deferred compensation within the meaning of Code Section 409A upon separation of service prior to the earliest of (1) the date that is six months after the date of separation from service for any reason other than death,  (2) the date of the Executive s death, or (3) such earlier time that would not cause the Executive to incur any excise tax under Code Section 409A. 

ARTICLE IV 
  SUCCESSOR TO CORPORATION 
    
  4.1        This Agreement shall bind any successor of AEPSC or the Corporation, its assets or its businesses (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) in the same manner and to the same extent that AEPSC or the Corporation would be obligated under this Agreement if no succession had taken place. 
    
  4.2        In the case of any transaction in which a successor would not by the foregoing provision or by operation of law be bound by this Agreement, AEPSC and the Corporation shall require such successor expressly and unconditionally to assume and agree to perform AEPSC s and the Corporation s obligations under this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that AEPSC and the Corporation would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.  The term  Corporation,  as used in this Agreement, shall mean the Corporation as hereinbefore defined and any successor or assignee to its business or assets which by reason hereof becomes bound by this Agreement. 
  
   10 

ARTICLE V 
  MISCELLANEOUS 
    
  5.1        Any notices and all other communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when delivered or mailed, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid addressed to AEPSC at its principal office and to the Executive at the Executive s residence or at such other addresses as AEPSC or the Executive shall designate in writing. 
    
  5.2        Except to the extent otherwise provided in Article II (Term of Agreement), no provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged except in writing specifically referring to such provision and signed by either AEPSC or the Executive against whom enforcement of such modification, waiver or discharge is sought.  No waiver by either AEPSC or the Executive of the breach of any condition or provision of this Agreement shall be deemed a waiver of any other condition or provision at the same or any other time. 
    
  5.3        The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Ohio. 
    
  5.4        The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. 
    
  5.5        This Agreement does not constitute a contract of employment or impose on the Executive, AEPSC or the Corporation any obligation to retain the Executive as an employee, to change the status of the Executive s employment, or to change AEPSC s policies regarding the termination of employment. 
    
  5.6        If the Executive institutes any legal action in seeking to obtain or enforce or is required to defend in any legal action the validity or enforceability of, any right or benefit provided by this Agreement, AEPSC will pay for all actual and reasonable legal fees and expenses incurred (as incurred) by the Executive, regardless of the outcome of such action; provided, however, that if such action instituted by the Executive is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be frivolous, the Executive shall not be entitled to legal fees and expenses and shall be liable to AEPSC for amounts already paid for this purpose. 
    
  5.7        If the Executive makes a written request alleging a right to receive benefits under this Agreement or alleging a right to receive an adjustment in benefits being paid under the Agreement, AEPSC shall treat it as a claim for benefit.  All claims for benefit under the Agreement shall be sent to the Human Resources Department of AEPSC and must be received within 30 days after the Executive s Termination of employment (or, if the Qualifying Termination is specified in Article I(o)(A) or (B), within 30 days after the Change in Control).  If AEPSC determines that the Executive who has claimed a right to receive benefits, or different benefits, under the Agreement is not entitled to receive all or  
  
   11 

any part of the benefits claimed, it will inform the Executive in writing of its determination and the reasons therefor in terms calculated to be understood by the Executive.  The notice will be sent within 90 days of the claim unless AEPSC determines additional time, not exceeding 90 days, is needed.  The notice shall make specific reference to the pertinent Agreement provisions on which the denial is based, and describe any additional material or information, if any, necessary for the Executive to perfect the claim and the reason any such additional material or information is necessary.  Such notice shall, in addition, inform the Executive what procedure the Executive should follow to take advantage of the review procedures set forth below in the event the Executive desires to contest the denial of the claim.  The Executive may within 90 days thereafter submit in writing to AEPSC a notice that the Executive contests the denial of the claim by AEPSC and desires a further review.  AEPSC shall within 60 days thereafter review the claim and authorize the Executive to appear personally and review pertinent documents and submit issues and comments relating to the claim to the persons responsible for making the determination on behalf of AEPSC.  AEPSC will render its final decision with specific reasons therefor in writing and will transmit it to the Executive within 60 days of the written request for review, unless AEPSC determines additional time, not exceeding 60 days, is needed, and so notifies the Executive.  If AEPSC fails to respond to a claim filed in accordance with the foregoing within 60 days or any such extended period, AEPSC shall be deemed to have denied the claim. 
    
  5.8        AEPSC intends that the design and administration of this Agreement are intended to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A to the extent such section is effective and applicable to amounts that may become available hereunder. However, no Executive, beneficiary or any other person shall have any recourse against AEPSC, the Corporation, or any of their affiliates, employees, agents, successors, assigns or other representatives if this condition is determined not to be satisfied. 
    
  AEPSC has caused this Change In Control Agreement to be signed on behalf of all participating employers as of the 24th day of October, 2016.

 AEP EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN, AMENDED AND RESTATED EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 24, 2016

Exhibit 

Exhibit 10(d) 
    
  AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER 
  EXECUTIVE SEVERANCE PLAN 
    
  (As Amended October 24, 2016) 

By resolution of the Human Resources Committee of American Electric Power Company, Inc. adopted this 24   th    day of October, 2016, this sets forth the American Electric Power Executive Severance Plan (the  Plan ), as amended and restated. The Plan was initially adopted on January 15, 2014.   
    
  ARTICLE I 
  PURPOSE AND TERM OF PLAN 
    
  Section 1.1        Purpose of the Plan  . The purpose of the Plan is to provide Eligible Employees with certain severance benefits as described in this Plan in the event the Eligible Employee s employment with the American Electric Power System is terminated due to an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation.  
    
  Section 1.2        Characterization and Interpretation of the Plan  .  The Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of Code section 409A and its related regulations and guidance. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, distributions may only be made under the Plan upon an event and in a manner permitted by Code section 409A or an applicable exemption. If a payment is not made by the designated payment date under the Plan, the payment shall be made by December 31 of the calendar year in which the designated payment date occurs. To the extent that any provision of the Plan would cause a conflict with the requirements of Code section 409A, or would cause the administration of the Plan to fail to satisfy the requirements of Code section 409A, such provision shall be deemed null and void to the extent permitted by applicable law. All payments to be made upon a termination of employment under this Plan may only be made upon a  separation from service  (as that term is defined under Code section 409A and its related regulations and guidance). For purposes of Code section 409A, any right to receive a particular payment or a series of installment payments under this Plan shall be treated as a right to receive separate (or a series of separate) payments. Any right to receive a reimbursement or in-kind benefit provided under the Plan shall be made or provided in accordance with the requirements of Code section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirement that: (i) any reimbursement shall be for expenses incurred during the Participant s lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Plan); (ii) the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made on or before the last day of the calendar year following the year in which the expense is incurred; and (iv) the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. 

Section 1.3        Term and Effect of the Plan  .  
    
  (a)  The Plan generally shall be effective as of the Effective Date and, except to the extent otherwise specified in the Plan, shall supersede any prior plan, program, policy, or agreement under which the AEP System Companies provided severance benefits prior to the Effective Date of the Plan for the Eligible Employees. However, the Plan shall not be construed so as to supersede any prior or existing plan, program, policy or agreement (or any portion of such prior arrangement) pursuant to which an Eligible Employee accrued benefits other than severance benefits. 
    
  (b)  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan shall not: (i) apply to any Employee who is subject to an existing employment or severance agreement pursuant to which the Company or any of the other AEP System Companies has arranged to provide severance benefits to the Employee until the term of such agreement expires (or, if earlier, such date as the Employee executes an acknowledgement that this Plan supersedes such agreement); or (ii) supersede any plan, program, policy or agreement pursuant to which the Company or any of the other AEP System Companies has arranged to provide severance benefits to an Employee in connection with the occurrence of a change in control.  
    
  (c)  The Plan shall continue until terminated pursuant to Article VIII of the Plan.  
    
  ARTICLE II 
  DEFINITIONS

  Section 2.4         Board  shall mean the Board of Directors of AEP, or any successor thereto.

An Eligible Employee shall not be eligible to receive any other severance benefits from the AEP System Companies on account of an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation, unless otherwise provided in the Plan; provided that if the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination of employment of such an Eligible Employee satisfies the requirements to receive the benefits under both this Plan and the General Severance Plan, such Eligible Employee shall not be precluded from receiving benefits under the General Severance Plan, provided that the benefits provided to such a Participant under this Plan shall be adjusted in the manner described in Article X. 
    
  Section 3.2        Conditions  .  
    
  (a)        Eligibility for any Severance Benefits is expressly conditioned on the satisfaction of all of the following conditions: 
    
           (i) 
    an Eligible Employee s written acknowledgment and agreement to comply with the provisions in Article VI during and after the Eligible Employee s employment with the AEP System Companies within such period as may be requested by the Company;  
       
           (ii)

           (iii) 
    execution and return to the Company of the Release (in the form provided by the Company) by the Participant within 60 days following the Participant s Termination Date (or such shorter period of time specified in the Release); and  
       
           (iv) 
    execution by the Participant of a written agreement that authorizes the deduction of amounts owed to the Company prior to the payment of any Severance Benefits (or in accordance with any other schedule as the Committee may, in its sole discretion, determine to be appropriate); provided, that the Committee determines in its sole discretion that such deduction is not in violation of Code section 409A.  
       
  (b)        If the Committee determines, in its sole discretion, that the Participant has not fully complied with any of the terms of the Release, the Committee may deny Severance Benefits not yet in pay status or discontinue the payment of the Participant s Severance Benefits and may  
  
   8 

require the Participant, by providing written notice of such repayment obligation to the Participant, to repay any portion of the Severance Benefits already received under the Plan. If the Committee notifies a Participant that repayment of all or any portion of the Severance Benefits received under the Plan is required, such amounts shall be repaid within 30 calendar days of the date the written notice is sent. Any remedy under this paragraph (b) shall be in addition to, and not in place of, any other remedy, including injunctive relief, that any AEP System Company may have.  
    
  (c)         An Eligible Employee who experiences a termination of employment that is not an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation shall not be eligible to receive Severance Benefits under the Plan. Specifically, and without limiting the foregoing, an Eligible Employee shall not be eligible to receive Severance Benefits upon the Eligible Employee s:  
    
           (i)

           (ii) 
    Change in Control Termination;  
       
           (iii)

ARTICLE IV 
  DETERMINATION OF SEVERANCE BENEFITS 
    
  Section 4.1        Amount of Severance Benefits Upon Involuntary Termination or Good Reason Resignation  . The Severance Benefits to be provided to a Participant who incurs an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation and who satisfies the conditions of Section 3.2 shall be as follows:  
    
  (a)        Salary and Bonus Severance.   Participants shall receive salary and bonus severance as follows:  
    
           (i) 
    Tier 1 Employees shall receive payment equal to 200% of the sum of (A) the Tier 1 Employee s Base Salary, plus (B) the Tier 1 Employee s Target Annual Incentive Payment (with both Base Salary and Target Annual Incentive Payment being determined without regard to any decrease in such Base Salary or Target Annual Incentive Payment that would constitute a basis for a Good Reason Resignation).  
       
           (ii) 
    Tier 2 Employees shall receive payment equal to 100% of the sum of (A) the Tier 2 Employee s Base Salary, plus (B) the Tier 2 Employee s Target Annual Incentive Payment (with both Base Salary and Target Annual Incentive Payment being determined without regard to any decrease in such Base Salary or Target Annual Incentive Payment that would constitute a basis for a Good Reason Resignation).  
       
  (b)        Restricted Stock Unit Awards.   Participants shall be considered to have vested in a fractional portion of the Participant s Restricted Stock Units (and related Dividend Equivalent RSUs) provided that the Participant s Termination may not otherwise lead to their vesting under the terms of the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement issued to the Participant under the LTIP.  The portion of Participant s Granted RSUs (and related Dividend Equivalent RSUs) (as those terms are defined in the applicable Restricted Stock Unit Award Agreement) that vest under this provision is determined as follows: 
    
           (i) 
    The number of whole months from the Effective Date defined in the RSU Award Agreement through the Participant s Termination Date divided by the number of whole months from that Effective Date until the final Vesting Date specified in the Vesting Schedule set forth at the beginning of such RSU Award Agreement;  
       
           (ii) 
    Reduced (but not below zero) by the cumulative Percentage of Granted Units for which the Vesting Date specified in the Vesting Schedule has passed as of the date the Participant s Termination Date. 
       
  (c)        Performance Unit Awards.   A Participant shall be eligible to receive a pro-rated share of any outstanding award of Performance Units granted to a Participant in accordance with the terms of the LTIP (a  Performance Unit Award ), provided that the Participant s Termination  
  
   10 

is not due to Termination of Employment Due to the Participant s Retirement or Triggering Event (as defined in such Performance Unit Award). This pro-rated share of any Performance Unit Award shall be calculated by multiplying: (i) the Performance Unit Award the Participant would have earned for the full performance period based on the performance of the AEP System Companies as determined at the end of the applicable performance period by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full months of the Participant s participation from the Grant Date specified in the Performance Unit Award until the Termination Date and the denominator of which is the total number of months in the applicable performance period for the Performance Unit Award.  
    
  (d)        The provisions of this Plan may provide for payments to the Participant under certain compensation or bonus plans of the AEP System Companies under circumstances where such plans would not otherwise provide for payment thereof. It is the specific intention of the Company that the provisions of this Plan shall supersede any provisions to the contrary in such plans, to the extent permitted by applicable law and that such plans not provide benefits that the Company determines to be duplicative of those provided by this Plan, and such plans shall be deemed to have been amended to correspond with this Plan without further action by the Company, the Committee or the Board.  
    
  Section 4.2        Other Terminations  . If the Eligible Employee s employment terminates on account of a reason other than an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation or the Eligible Employee does not otherwise satisfy the conditions of Section 3.2, the Eligible Employee shall not be entitled to receive Severance Benefits under this Plan and shall be entitled only to those benefits (if any) as may be available under the Company s then-existing benefit plans and policies at the time of such termination.  
    
  Section 4.3        Termination for Cause  . If any Eligible Employee s employment terminates on account of termination by the Company for Cause, the Eligible Employee shall not be entitled to receive Severance Benefits under this Plan and shall be entitled only to those benefits that are legally required to be provided to the Eligible Employee. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, if the Committee determines that an Eligible Employee engaged in conduct that constituted Cause at any time prior to the Eligible Employee s Termination Date, any Severance Benefits payable to the Eligible Employee under Section 4.1 shall immediately cease, and the Eligible Employee shall be required to return any Severance Benefits paid to the Eligible Employee prior to such determination. If the Company has offset other payments owed to the Eligible Employee under any other plan or program, it may, in its sole discretion, waive its repayment right under this Plan solely with respect to the amount of the offset already taken.  
    
  Section 4.4        Reduction of Severance Benefits  . The Plan Administrator reserves the right to make deductions in accordance with applicable law for any monies owed to the AEP System Companies by the Participant or the value of the property of the AEP System Companies that the Participant has retained in his or her possession; provided, however, that no such deduction shall be made if the Company determines that such would be inconsistent with the requirements of Code section 409A.

           (ii)

  (b)        Payment of Restricted Stock Unit Award Severance Benefits.   The Restricted Stock Unit Award benefit described in Section 4.1(b) shall be satisfied by converting into a single share of AEP Common Stock each RSU (including each Granted RSU and each vested Dividend Equivalent RSU) that thereupon becomes vested.  The shares of AEP Common Stock resulting from the conversion of the vested RSUs shall be delivered to the Participant or to an account set up for the Participant s benefit with a broker/dealer designated by the Company (the  Broker/Dealer Account ) as of the earlier of (i) six months after the Participant s Termination Date or (ii) the 15   th    day of the third month after the calendar year in which falls the Participant s Termination Date (or the immediately preceding business day of such broker-dealer, if that day is not such a business day).

12 

(d)        Taxes.   All payments of Severance Benefits are subject to applicable federal, state and local taxes and withholdings. The Company, in its discretion, may reduce the number of shares of AEP Common Stock delivered to the Participant under Section 5.1(b) to satisfy such tax withholding obligation.  The amount of such reduction shall be based upon the Fair Market Value (as defined in the LTIP) of AEP Common Stock at that time; provided, however, that any reduction to a Participant s vested RSUs for applicable tax withholding shall not exceed such limits as may be applicable to comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A.   
    
  (e)        Participant s Death; No Interest.    In the event of the Participant s death prior to payment being made, the amount of such payment shall be paid in accordance with the terms of an applicable award, or to the extent not specified by such award, to the Participant s estate. In no event will interest be credited on the unpaid balance for which a Participant may become eligible.  
    
  Section 5.2        Termination of Eligibility for Benefits  . Eligible Employees shall cease to be eligible to participate in the Plan, and the payment of all Severance Benefits shall cease upon the occurrence of the earlier of: (i) subject to Article VIII, termination or modification of the Plan; or (ii) completion of payment to the Participant of the Severance Benefits for which the Participant is eligible under Article IV. Further, notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Committee shall have the right to cease the payment of all Severance Benefits and to recover payments previously made to the Participant should the Participant at any time breach the Participant s undertakings under the terms of the Plan (including, without limitation, a determination that the Participant engaged in conduct that constitutes Cause), the Release the Participant executed to obtain the Severance Benefits under the Plan, or the covenants set forth in Article VI.

ARTICLE VII 
  PLAN ADMINISTRATION; DUTIES OF THE COMPANY, THE COMMITTEE AND 
  THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR; AND CLAIMS 
    
  Section 7.1        Authority and Duties  . It shall be the duty of the Plan Administrator, on the basis of information supplied to it by the Company and the Committee, to properly administer the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall have the full power, authority, and discretion to construe, interpret, and administer the Plan, to make factual determinations, to correct deficiencies therein, and to supply omissions. All decisions, actions, and interpretations of the Plan Administrator shall be final, binding, and conclusive upon the parties, subject only to determinations by the Plan Administrator, with respect to denied claims for Severance Benefits. The Plan Administrator may adopt such rules and regulations and may make such decisions as it deems necessary or desirable for the proper administration of the Plan. The Plan Administrator shall be a  named fiduciary  within the meaning of ERISA.  
    
  Section 7.2        Payment  . Payments of Severance Benefits to Participants shall be made in such amount as determined by the Committee under Article IV (subject to adjustment as set forth in Article X), from the Company s general assets, in accordance with the terms of the Plan, as directed by the Committee.  
    
  Section 7.3        Discretion  . Any decisions, actions or interpretations to be made under the Plan by the Board, the Committee and the Plan Administrator, acting on behalf of either, shall be made in each of their respective sole discretion, not in any fiduciary capacity and need not be uniformly applied to similarly situated individuals and such decisions, actions or interpretations shall be final, binding and conclusive upon all parties. As a condition of participating in the Plan, each Eligible Employee acknowledges that all decisions and determinations of the Board, the Committee, and the Plan Administrator shall be final and binding on the Eligible Employee, his or her beneficiaries, and any other person having or claiming an interest under the Plan on his or her behalf; provided, however, that the Eligible Employee shall have the right to challenge any such decisions and determinations in accordance with the claims and appeals procedures set forth in Section 7.4 and applicable law.  
    
  Section 7.4        Claims Administration  .  
    
  (a)        Each Participant under this Plan may contest only the calculation and administration of the Severance Benefits awarded by completing and filing with the Plan Administrator a written request for review in the manner specified by the Plan Administrator. No claim or appeal is permissible as to a Participant s eligibility for or amount of Severance Benefits or as to whether a Participant s termination constitutes an Involuntary Termination or a Good Reason Resignation, which are decisions made solely within the discretion of the Company, and the Committee acting on behalf of the Company. No person may bring an action for any alleged wrongful denial of Plan benefits in a court of law unless the claims procedures described in this Article VII are exhausted and a final determination is made by the Plan Administrator. If the  
  
   17 

terminated Participant or interested person challenges a decision by the Plan Administrator, a review by the court of law will be limited to the facts, evidence and issues presented to the Plan Administrator during the claims procedure set forth in this Article VII. Facts and evidence that become known to the terminated Participant or other interested person after having exhausted the claims procedure must be brought to the attention of the Plan Administrator for reconsideration. Issues not raised with the Plan Administrator will be deemed waived.  
    
  (b)        Before the date on which payment of Severance Benefits commence, each such application must be supported by such information as the Plan Administrator deems relevant and appropriate. In the event that any claim relating to the administration of Severance Benefits is denied in whole or in part, the terminated Participant or his or her beneficiary (the  Claimant ) whose claim has been so denied shall be notified of such denial in writing by the Plan Administrator within 90 days after the receipt of the claim for benefits. This period may be extended an additional 90 days if the Plan Administrator determines such extension is necessary and the Plan Administrator provides notice of extension to the Claimant prior to the end of the initial 90-day period. The notice advising of the denial shall specify the following: (i) the reason or reasons for denial; (ii) make specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the determination was based; (iii) describe any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim (explaining why such material or information is needed); and (iv) describe the Plan s review procedures and the time limits applicable to such procedures, including a statement of the Claimant s right to bring a civil action under section 502(a) of ERISA following an adverse benefit determination on review.  
    
  (c)        A Claimant whose claim has been denied shall file with the Plan Administrator a notice of appeal of the denial. Such notice shall be filed within 60 calendar days of notification by the Plan Administrator of the denial of a claim, shall be made in writing, and shall set forth all of the facts upon which the appeal is based. Appeals not timely filed shall be barred. The Plan Administrator shall consider the merits of the Claimant s written presentations, the merits of any facts or evidence in support of the denial of benefits, and such other facts and circumstances as the Plan Administrator shall deem relevant.  
    
  (d)        The Plan Administrator shall render a determination upon the appealed claim which determination shall be accompanied by a written statement as to the reasons therefore. The determination shall be communicated to the Claimant within 60 days of the Claimant s request for review, unless the Plan Administrator determines that special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim. In such case, the Plan Administrator shall notify the Claimant of the need for an extension of time to render its decision prior to the end of the initial 60-day period, and the Plan Administrator shall have an additional 60-day period to make its determination. The determination so rendered shall be binding upon all parties. If the determination is adverse to the Claimant, the notice shall: (i) provide the reason or reasons for denial; (ii) make specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the determination was based; (iii) include a statement that the Claimant is entitled to receive, upon request and free of charge, reasonable access to, and copies of, all documents, records and other information relevant to the Claimant s claim for benefits; and (iv) state that the Claimant has the right to bring an action under section 502(a) of ERISA.
