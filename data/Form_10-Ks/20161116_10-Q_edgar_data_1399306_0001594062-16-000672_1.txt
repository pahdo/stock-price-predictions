1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 

Organization and Description of Business  

Simlatus manufactures, in their facility, its own product line of commercial audio and video systems that offer advanced applications used within the Broadcast Industry and other industries where such applications are required. The company products are sold through a global distribution network of established audio/video equipment retailers that have been selling the Simlatus products for the past 18 years. 

Simlatus Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada under the name Sunberta Resources Inc. on November 15, 2006, as a mining and exploration of mineral claims business.  On November 18, 2009, the Company changed its name to Grid Petroleum Corp. and continued with the mining and exploration of mineral claims operations, exploring mining claims in Alberta, Canada, Vancouver Island, British Columbia, England and the United States. 

On January 20, 2011, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the  Agreement ) with a Nevada corporation, Joaquin Basin Resources Inc., ( Seller ), and its stockholders, ( Selling Shareholders ).  Joaquin Basin Resources Inc. became the wholly owned subsidiary of Grid Petroleum.  In 2012, Joaquin Basin ceased operations and its business license in the State of Nevada was revoked in 2012. 

On March 9, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the  Asset Purchase Agreement ) with RJM and Associates, LLC, a California limited liability company ( RJM  thereby, acquiring Intellectual Property referred to as  Media IP  and inventory consisting of finished products and raw materials and supplies.  RJM will assign the Media IP asset and inventories and provide  Know-How  that will enable the Company to launch a Broadcast Equipment and Digital Media Product Line, together valued at Six Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($6,250,000).  As consideration for the Media IP and the  Know -How , the Buyer shall issue, or cause to be issued, $5,000,000 of Restricted Common Stock (PAR $.00001) Ninety (90) days from the date of this agreement and $1,250,000 of Preferred Series-A Shares of a GRPR Preferred Stock; (PAR $.001). The value of restricted common shares will be the closing price of the stock as of 90 days from this agreement. The maturity date for the restricted common shares will be 60 months from the date of this agreement. 

On March 25, 2016, the Company approved a name change to Simlatus Corporation, stock symbol SIML, which was executed on April 4, 2016. The new name change better describes the Company s new business and new revenues in selling commercial broadcast equipment on a global basis. Simlatus Corporation develops, manufactures, markets and owns proprietary advanced broadcast equipment and software and sells this audio and video broadcast equipment worldwide. These systems have been sold worldwide over the past 15 years including some of the major broadcast companies.   On August 3, 2016, the Company modified the Asset Purchase Agreement.  No Restricted Common Stock shares were issued pursuant to the Agreement, and on August 3, 2016, the Parties entered into an Amendment to the Agreement wherein only the terms of the Agreement relative to the issuance of the Restricted Common Stock were modified.  The terms relative to the issuance of the Restricted Common Stock Shares shall be modified as follows: 

As consideration for the Media IP and the  Know How  the Company will issue, or cause to be issued, $5,000,000 of Restricted Common Stock, par value $0.00001, valued at the lowest closing market price with a 15 day look back.  The Shares may be issued in increments of up to $1,500,000 at the discretion of the Board of the Directors until the full amount of $5,000,000 has been satisfied.  Any amount of shares not issued in a $1,500,000 increment may be rolled over and added to the next issuance, and at the discretion of the Board of Directors. The entire $5,000,000 worth of Shares must be issued within 60 months of this Amendment, unless extended, in writing, by the Board of Directors. 

The Company, respectively, sells approximately 55 different audio/video products, and is preparing to market its newest audio/video product referred to as SyncPal . In addition to the Company s traditional line of audio/video products, it has commenced the research   development of its Immersive Broadcast System, referred to as the Simlatus-IBS . The Simlatus-IBS  will include commercial augmented reality and virtual reality applications for studio engineers. These applications, both hardware and software, will allow the customer to control and manage the studio audio/video systems from anywhere in the world. These products are being developed to serve a market segment that is presently being strongly embraced by consumers and is forecasted, by some of the most widely recognized tech companies in the world, as becoming a multi-billion dollar market in the very near future. The Market Analysis and IP Portfolio will include new patents specifically developed for these products and owned by the Company. 

Principles of Consolidation  

The consolidated financial statements include accounts and assets of the current Company and the previous oil   gas operations. All significant inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

Cash and cash equivalents are comprised of cash and highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of less than six months that may not be reported as investments. While the Company may maintain cash and cash equivalents in bank deposit accounts, which at times exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured limits, they have not experienced any losses in such accounts. 

Management believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents. 

Broadcast Equipment Products and Support Services  

The company sells 55 various products related to the broadcast industry. These products are sold through a global distribution network of audio/video retailers. The company has an established B2B distribution platform so that the distributor can request a quote for all related product inquiries, and the distributor provides a purchase order to confirm the itemized sale. The company provides established and qualified distributors with a 30 Day 2% Net 10 Days payment option, and sometimes requires a deposit against the purchase order, and full payment is required prior to shipping/delivery of the product(s). The Company offers a 3-Year Limited Warranty, along with any technical support required for the customer. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets  

The Company periodically analyzes its long-lived assets for potential impairment, assessing the appropriateness of lives and recoverability of unamortized balances through measurement of undiscounted operating cash flows in accordance with ASC No. 144,  Property, Plant and Equipment . If impairment is deemed to exist, it will be written down to its fair value. Fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. As of September 30, 2016, the Company does not believe any adjustment for impairment is required.

SIMLATUS CORPORATION.

(A Development Stage Company)  

NOTES TO THE INTERIM CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

September 30, 2016  

(Unaudited)  

Asset Retirement Obligations  

The Company has adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic ( ASC ) No. 410,  Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations  which requires that the fair value of liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred. ASC No. 410 requires a liability to be recorded for the present value of the estimated site restoration costs with a corresponding increase to the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset. The liability will be accreted and the asset will be depreciated over the life of the related assets. Adjustments for changes resulting from the passage of time and changes to either the timing or amount of the original present value estimate underlying the obligation will be made. The Company has not incurred any asset retirement obligations as of September 30, 2016. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of the Company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 

Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Loss Per Share  

Basic loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period after giving retroactive effect to the reverse stock split affected on July 22, 2016 (see Note 10).  Diluted earnings (loss) per share is equal to the basic per share for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Common stock equivalents are not included in the loss per share since they are anti-dilutive.  All per share amounts have been adjusted for the reverse stock split. 

Inventories  

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out method and net realizable value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the current period. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s inventories consist primarily of raw materials and supplies rather than finished goods. 

Long Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets  

The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The Company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives over periods from three to seven years. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The carrying value of cash, notes payable, and accounts at September 30, 2016 and 2015 reflected in these financial statements approximates their fair value due to the short-term maturity of these financial instruments. 

Income Taxes  

The Company records deferred taxes in accordance with FASB ASC No. 740,  Income Taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and loss carry-forwards and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect of a change in tax rules on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the year of change. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is  more likely-than-not  that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

Comprehensive Income  

The Company has adopted ASC No. 220, Comprehensive Income. Comprehensive income includes net income and all changes in equity during a period that arises from non-owner sources, such as foreign currency items and unrealized gains and losses on certain investments in equity securities. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

The Company has reviewed recently issued accounting pronouncements and plans to adopt those that are applicable to it. The Company does not expect the adoption of any other pronouncements to have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position. 

Reclassification  

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.

2. GOING CONCERN 

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going-concern basis which assumes the Company will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. 

The Company has experienced substantial losses since its inception and has limited business operations, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as going concern. The ability of the Company to meet its commitments as they become payable, including the completion of acquisitions, exploration and development of oil and gas properties and projects, is dependent on the ability of the Company to obtain necessary financing or achieving a profitable level of operations. There is no assurance the Company will be successful in achieving these goals. 

The Company does not have sufficient cash to fund its desired research   development objectives for its augmented/virtual reality product development for the next 12 months. The Company has arranged financing as described in Note 5 and intends to draw upon this financing arrangement to fund the research   development project. This financing may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash requirements required to complete the product design for the augmented/virtual reality markets. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in completing any new product development. The Company plans to seek additional financing if necessary in private or public equity offering(s) to secure future funding for operations. There can be no assurance the Company will be successful in raising additional funding. If the Company is not able to secure additional funding, the implementation of the Company s business plan will be impaired. There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to the Company on acceptable terms or at all. 

These financial statements do not give effect to adjustments to the amounts and classification to assets and liabilities that would be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 

3. OIL AND GAS PROPERTIES 

On January 20, 2011, the Company purchased, through its subsidiary Joaquin Basin Resources Inc., a 50% working interest (37% net revenue interest) in a mineral lease on 4,000 acres in Kings and Fresno counties in California. The lease was initially recorded at the cost of issuing 62,000,000 common shares.  On January 20, 2012, 2,076,000 shares of convertible preferred stock were issued in concluding the Joaquin Basin purchase agreement. The cost of the issue, $4,152,000, was based on the value of preferred stock as if converted to common stock. The total cost, $7,026,666, was supported by a volumetric analysis. 

On November 21, 2011, a portion of the interest in the lease was swapped for a future  carry  of exploration costs and administration of the lease. Grid s 50% working interest (37.5% net revenue interest) was reduced to 30% and 14% respectively. The co-lessee, is the obligor under the agreement. Future exploration costs include the operating  carry  costs of the lease and drilling costs of the first well, named  First Farmin Well.  The exploration costs were valued based on the percentage reduction in net revenue interest. A reduction of $4,825,334 in the value of the Joaquin Basin property was recorded. 

Impairment of the California properties from their recorded acquisition values was considered at March 31, 2015 and 2014. Management considered that there were no changes in circumstances that would warrant impairment from the estimated values indicated by independently prepared geological reports. 

On October 18, 2013, the Company entered into an Asset Swap Agreement (the  Asset Swap Agreement ) by and amongst the Company, Xploration Inc., a Nevada Corporation ( Xploration ) and Solimar Energy, LLC, a California limited liability company ( Solimar  thereby, swapping certain land leases as described below, forgiveness of delay rentals and terminating the (a) Kreyenhagen Trend Joint Operating Agreement dated March 1, 2011, between Solimar and Xploration ( Kreyenhagen Trend JOA ), (b) Jacalitos Joint Operating Agreement dated March 1, 2011, between Solimar and Xploration ( Jacalitos JOA ) and the (c) Farmin / Settlement Agreement dated November 3, 2011, between Solimar and Xploration, with an effective date as of September 1, 2013.   

Solimar assigned eighty four percent (84%) of its interest in the Bureau of Land Management Lease, serial number: CACA 49877 representing 1,140.62 gross and net landowner acres that is a part of the Kreyenhagen Trend to the Company. 

The Company has oil and gas properties in Wyoming which it does not wish to develop and, accordingly has recorded an impairment in the amount of $85,334 at March 31, 2013. 

In connection with an Amendment to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated November 21, 2011, the Company recorded rights to future exploration costs in the amount of $4,825,334 on its balance sheet as of March 31, 2012. The Company recorded a full impairment as of March 31, 2013. 

Oil and gas properties are summarized as follows as of March 31, 2016: 

On May 19, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement with Direct Capital Group, Inc., whereby Direct Capital Group, Inc., agreed to cancel $1,685,842 in notes payable in exchange for acquired oil and gas leases valued at $7,026,666.  The Company recorded a loss on the sale of property of $5,340,824 as of September 30, 2016.  Furthermore, Direct Capital Group, Inc., agreed to cancel any further liabilities associated with exploration and development costs and the acquired oil and gas lease of properties in California associated with Direct Capital Group, Inc.; and Direct Capital Group, Inc. agreed to accept the ongoing liabilities of the exploration and development costs and the acquired oil and gas leases.

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had total liabilities of $4,781,873 compared with $10,214,753 as of March 31, 2016. The decrease in total liabilities was primarily attributed to the cancellation of promissory notes.

Quarterly Developments 

None. 

Subsequent Developments 

None. 

Going Concern 

We have not attained profitable operations and are dependent upon obtaining financing to pursue any extensive acquisitions and activities. For these reasons, our auditors stated in their report on our audited financial statements that they have substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without further financing. 

Future Financings 

We will continue to rely on equity sales of our common shares in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of the equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our operations and other activities. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

We regularly evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the notes to our financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management. 

27 

Inflation 

The amounts presented in the financial statements do not provide for the effect of inflation on our operations or financial position. The net operating losses shown would be greater than reported if the effects of inflation were reflected either by charging operations with amounts that represent replacement costs or by using other inflation adjustments. 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

On June 10, 2014, The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10,  Development Stage Entities (Topic 915):   Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, consolidation,  which removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities, including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. For the first annual period beginning after December 15, 2014, the presentation and disclosure requirements in Topic 915 will no longer be required for the public business entities. The revised consolidation standards are effective one year later, in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted.  

The Company has implemented all other new accounting pronouncements that are in effect. These pronouncements did not have any material impact on the financial statements unless otherwise disclosed, and the Company does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

We are a non-accelerated filer and a smaller reporting company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and as such, are not required to provide the information under this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange Act"), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our sole officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our sole officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on the evaluation of these disclosure controls and procedures, and in light of the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016, that was filed with the SEC on June 29, 2016, the sole officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are ineffective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

We have not yet implemented any of the recommended changes to internal control over financial reporting listed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended March 31, 2016. As such, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
