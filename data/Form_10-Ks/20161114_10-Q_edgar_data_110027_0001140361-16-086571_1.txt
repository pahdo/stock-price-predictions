 The Company

Le@P Technology, Inc. (the  Company )  currently has no business operations, no revenues or revenue-producing activities.  As further discussed below, the Company has limited cash, and ongoing expenses as well as substantial indebtedness and liabilities . 

As previously reported i n the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K and 8-K/A dated December 31, 2015 (the  December 2015 8-K ), in December 2015 the Company received a $100,000 loan (the  December 2015 Loan ), on the terms disclosed (including a 2.50% interest rate and maturity date for principal and all accrued interest of March 31, 2017), from the  M. Lee Pearce Living Trust (the  Majority Stockholder Trust ), of which the Company s indirect and beneficial majority stockholder, M. Lee Pearce, M.D. ( Dr. Pearce ), is the 100% beneficial owner (Dr. Pearce, together with entities owned or controlled by him that own capital stock of the Company, are collectively referred to as the  Majority Stockholder ) .  The Majority Stockholder s beneficial ownership of the Company s issued and outstanding capital stock is reported under Item 12 (in the section entitled  Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters ) below.  The Company has received no additional loans, advances or funding, from the Majority Stockholder Trust or any other party, since December 2015.

As reported on the Form 8-K dated April 15, 2016 (the  April 2016 8-K), the Company entered into a material definitive agreement on April 15, 2016 to sell real property owned by the Company s wholly-owned subsidiary Parkson Property, L.L.C.   The contract provided for (i) a gross sale price of $1.4 million (all cash, with no financing contingency), (ii) an escrow deposit from Buyer of $100,000, (iii) a 90-day  free look  period (the  Inspection Period ) during which Buyer could conduct a Phase I environmental assessment and other tests, surveys, investigations and inspections, (iv) conveyance of the property by special warranty deed at a closing to occur within fifteen (15) days of the end of the Inspection Period, (v) closing costs to be paid by the parties, and (vi) other matters included in Florida Association of Realtors form contracts addressing the sale and purchase of vacant land.  In addition,  commissions of 3% were to be paid to the Buyer s agent and 3% to the Company s agent.  The Company s agent was Marquette Realty Advisors, Inc.  The Company s Class B Director, Chairman and President (Timothy C. Lincoln) is the principal and beneficial owner of Marquette Realty Advisors, Inc  which received a $42,000 commission from the proceeds of the sale .

As reported on the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K dated September 1, 2016, on July 14, 2016, the Buyer requested a Feasibility Extension period through August 15, 2016. The Company and Buyer entered into an amendment to the vacant land contract through August 15, 2016. In consideration for the extension, the amendment included a non-refundable $20,000 extension fee. All other amounts, terms and conditions were unamended. The Company received the $20,000 extension fee on July 22, 2016.

The Company engaged an independent fairness expert to value the Parkson Property and to give an opinion of the fairness of the commissions to be paid. The fairness expert deemed the commissions to be paid as reasonable and customary, and the Parkson property was valued at $1,300,000.

On September 1, 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Parkson Property under the amounts, terms and conditions described above. Accordingly, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of the property of $923,154 for the three and nine  months  ended September 30, 2016. The Company incurred general and administrative expenses related to the property of  $1,841 and $2,447 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $6,646 and $7,342 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which is included in  gain ( loss )  from discontinued operations.

The Company s total indebtedness outstanding  as of September 30, 2016  was $3,063,424 (excluding accrued interest in the amount of $57,702).  The Company s indebtedness substantially exceeds the book value of its assets.  As noted above, in December 2015, (i) the Company received the  $100,000 December 2015 Loan from  Majority Stockholder Trust,  and (ii) through the  December 2015 Parkson Replacement Note, the lender thereunder (an entity wholly-owned by Dr. Pearce), among other things, extended the maturity date (principal and all accrued interest) under that note from March 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017.  In addition, as previously reported i n the Company s December 2015 8-K and 8-K/A, in December 2015, the  Majority Stockholder Trust, among other things, agreed to extend the maturity date (principal and all accrued interest) on its other outstanding  working capital  loans to the Company (totaling  $2,963,424  in principal amount as of December 31, 2015 , excluding the $100,000 December 2015 Loan amount ), such that t he principal and all accrued interest (at the rate of 2.50% per annum) are due in one lump sum on March 31, 2017.

During 2016, the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board  or  Board of Directors ) considered and intended to pursue, subject to budget and cash constraints, potential acquisition and possibly joint venture and investment opportunities (particularly those in the health care technology, products and services and life sciences arenas) ( Opportunities ) that may have come to the attention of Board members or management, including Opportunities introduced by Dr. Pearce or his network of contacts. None of the Opportunities came to fruition.

On September 6, 2016, our board of directors unanimously approved a Plan of Dissolution subject to approval of a majority of the stockholders of the Company. On November   14  , 2016, the Majority Stockholder, which holds approximately 96% of the voting power of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock and all of the outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, consented in writing under Section 228 of the   Delaware General Corporation Law ( DGCL )   approving adoption of the Plan of Dissolution.  Accordingly, no vote of any other stockholder is necessary and no additional stockholder votes on this matter will be solicited. 

November   4   , 2016, has been fixed as the record date for the determination of our stockholders entitled to receive  an Information Statement pursuant to the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 with respect to the dissolution of the Company. As of the close of business on the record date,  the Majority Stockholder beneficially owned, in the aggregate, 62,597,409 shares of the Company s Class A Common Stock, representing approximately 96% of our outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, and all of the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.

On November   14  , 2016, the Company filed a preliminary information statement with the Securities Exchange Commission.  Upon becoming final, the Information Statement will be provided to holders of the Company s common stock pursuant to Rule 14c-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Rule 14c-2 ). This Information Statement will contain a detailed description of the Plan of Dissolution. This Information Statement will also constitute the notice to the Company's stockholders of taking of a corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent of the stockholders, as required by Section 228(e) of the Delaware General Corporation Law. Pursuant to Rule 14c-2, the corporate actions will not be effective until at least twenty (20) calendar days after the mailing of the Information Statement to the Company s stockholders. 

The adoption of the Plan of Dissolution constitutes full and complete authority for the Board and officers   and Majority Stockholder  , without further stockholder action, to do and perform any and all acts, and to make, execute and deliver any and all agreements, conveyances, assignments, transfers, certificates and other documents of any kind and character that the Board or such officers deem necessary, appropriate or advisable: (i) to dissolve the Company in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware and cause its withdrawal from all jurisdictions in which it is authorized to do business; (ii) to sell, dispose, convey, transfer and deliver all of the remaining assets and properties of the Company; (iii) to satisfy or provide for the satisfaction of the Company s obligations in accordance with Sections 280 and 281 of the DGCL; and (iv) to distribute any properties and assets of the Company and all remaining funds pro rata to the Company s stockholders and in accordance with the distribution rights of the Company s then outstanding shares of capital stock. 

Due to the size of our liabilities  and lack of any significant assets ,   HOLDERS OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAVE NO PROSPECT OF RECEIVING A DISTRIBUTION OF ANY KIND AS A RESULT OF THE LIQUIDATION AND DISSOLUTION  . 

Under the Plan of Dissolution, the Company will take the following actions at such times the Board of Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems necessary, appropriate or advisable:  

file a certificate of dissolution with the Delaware Secretary of State in accordance with the Plan of Dissolution (the  Certificate of Dissolution 

cease conducting normal business operations, except as may be required to wind-up our business affairs;

sell, exchange or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company s non-cash property and assets, including but not limited to its remaining tangible assets, intellectual property and other intangible assets;

pay or make reasonable provision as reasonably likely for payment of our liabilities and obligations, including setting aside a contingency reserve, consisting of cash or other assets that our board of directors believes to be adequate for payment of our known liabilities, as well as claims that are unknown or have not yet arisen but that are likely to arise or become known to us within ten years; and

take all actions required or permitted under the dissolution procedures of Section 281(b) of the DGCL.

Operating Losses and Cash Flow Deficiencies

As noted above and in previous reports filed by the Company with  the Securities Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) ,  the Company  currently has no business operations, no revenues or revenue-producing activities, and has limited cash, and ongoing expenses as well as substantial indebtedness and liabilities .   Throughout its recent history, the Company has relied entirely upon the Majority Stockholder Trust (and other affiliates of Dr. Pearce) to fund working capital and expenses (and to extend maturities on indebtedness owing to the Majority Stockholder Trust and other affiliates of Dr. Pearce), acting in its (and their) discretion.  The Company has received no loans, advances or funding, from the Majority Stockholder Trust or any other party, since December 2015.  Neither the Majority Stockholder Trust nor any other party has  made any commitment or undertaken any obligation  to provide additional funding or financing to the Company (or to extend the maturity dates on existing indebtedness), including in connection with working capital needs, preparing, negotiating, reaching a definitive agreement with respect to or consummating any Opportunities . As a result  of the  approved plan  of  dissolution,   the Majority Stockholder Trust (or any other affiliate of Dr.   Pearce or any other party) does not intend to make further advances or   extend the maturity dates on any existing indebtedness.

 Notes Payable to Related Parties

As noted above, Le@P Technology, Inc. s wholly-owned subsidiary, Parkson,  owned  the Real Property.  Parkson purchased the Real Property on September 28, 2001 from Bay Colony Associates, Ltd. ( Bay Colony ), an entity wholly-owned by Dr. Pearce, in exchange for a two-month note in the amount of $37,500, and a five-year note (the  Long Term Note ) and related mortgage in the amount of $712,500.  The purchase price was based on an independent third-party appraisal.  As previously reported in the Company s December 2015 8-K and 8-K/A, the Long Term Note was replaced a number of times and  was  evidenced by the December 2015 Parkson Replacement Note (as defined above) in the principal amount of $916,183.  The December 2015 Parkson Replacement Note bears interest at the rate of 2.50% per annum, with both principal and all accrued interest due in one lump sum on March 31, 2017.  On September 1, 2016, the note was paid in full, along with accrued interest in the amount of $15,437, from the proceeds on the sale of the property  discussed in Note 1 .

As previously reported in the Company s December 2015 8-K and 8-K/A, and as discussed above, the Majority Stockholder Trust, of which Dr. Pearce is the 100% beneficial owner, provided the Company with the $100,000 December 2015 Loan in December 2015.  The Company has received no additional loans, advances or funding, from the Majority Stockholder Trust or any other party, since December of 2015.

In addition to the December 2015 Loan, the Majority Stockholder Trust previously made other working capital loans to the Company, which were, prior to their combination and extension (as described below), evidenced by a combined promissory note made by the Company in favor of the Majority Stockholder Trust and dated December 27, 2014 (in the original principal amount of $2,852,359) (the  2014 Working Capital Note ).  The maturity date of the 2014 Working Capital Note was, prior to its agreed extension (as described below), March 31, 2016.

As previously reported initially in the Company s December 2015 8-K and 8-K/A, and as discussed above, on December 31, 2015, the Majority Stockholder Trust, as holder of and payee under the 2014 Working Capital Note, agreed: (i) to extend the maturity date of the total outstanding indebtedness under the 2014 Working Capital Note from March 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017 (the  Extended Maturity Date ), and (ii) to combine the total outstanding indebtedness evidenced by and under the December 2015 Loan (as described above) and the 2014 Working Capital Note (including its outstanding principal amount and accrued interest through December 30, 2015) into a single promissory note, thereby replacing the 2014 Working Capital Note with a 2015 Combined Promissory Note (Working Capital) dated December 31, 2015 in the principal amount of $3,063,424 (the  2015 Combined Promissory Note ).  The principal and all accrued interest   at the agreed rate of 2.50% per annum   under the 2015 Combined Promissory Note are due in one lump sum on the Extended Maturity Date of March 31, 2017.  Other than the new (combined) principal amount, which includes the principal amount of the December  2015  Loan, the reduction of the rate to 2.50% per annum from 3.75% per annum, and the extension of the maturity date, in each case as noted above, the terms of the 2014 Working Capital Note were not changed and this note (and the obligations thereunder) is now incorporated in and replaced and evidenced by the 2015 Combined Promissory Note.

Table of Contents  

Throughout its recent history, the Company has relied entirely upon the Majority Stockholder Trust (and other affiliates of Dr. Pearce) to fund working capital and expenses (and to extend maturities on indebtedness owing to the Majority Stockholder Trust and other affiliates of Dr. Pearce), acting in its (and their) discretion.  The Company has received no loans, advances or funding, from the Majority Stockholder Trust or any other party, since December 2015.  Neither the Majority Stockholder Trust nor any other party has  made any commitment or undertaken any obligation  to provide additional funding or financing to the Company (or to extend the maturity dates on existing indebtedness).  There can be no assurance that the Majority Stockholder Trust (or any other affiliate of the Majority Stockholder or any other party) will provide funding or financing to the Company, or that the Majority Stockholder Trust (or any other affiliate of the Majority Stockholder) will agree to extend the maturity dates on any existing indebtedness.  In addition, if the Majority Stockholder Trust (or any affiliate of the Majority Stockholder), in its discretion, were to provide or facilitate any such funding or financing, there can be no assurance that the Majority Stockholder Trust would continue to do so (or extend maturity dates on existing indebtedness) in the future, or regarding the amount, terms, restrictions or conditions of any such funding or financing.

All of the Company s existing outstanding indebtedness is scheduled to mature on March 31, 2017.  The total amount of such indebtedness (principal and interest), all due to related parties, as of September 30, 2016 was $3,121,126.

4. 
 
 Financial Instruments and Fair Values

The fair value of a financial instrument represents the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon relevant market information about the financial instrument.

The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.

The fair values of all other financial instruments, including debt, approximate their book values as the instruments are short-term in nature or contain market rates of interest.

5. 
 
 Provision for Income Taxes

The Company does not have provision for income taxes as the taxable income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 will be offset by previously unrecognized net operating loss carryforwards that are available.

Item 2.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain statements in Management s Discussion and Analysis ( MD A ), other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, forecasts, statements relating to the plans, objectives and expected or anticipated business, operations, development, pursuits, liquidity, capital resources, financial condition or operating results of the Company, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ).  These forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words  believe,   project,   expect,   anticipate,   seek ,  estimate,   budget,   intend,   strategy,   plan,   objective,   goal,   propose,   pursuit,   may,   should,   will,   would,   will be,   can ,  could,   will continue,   will likely result,  and similar words, statements and expressions.  Forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties that can be difficult to predict or ascertain and which may cause the actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements.    In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward-looking statements included herein particularly in view of the current state of the Company, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a statement by the Company or any other person that these forward-looking statements (or the Company s goals, objectives, plans, pursuits, intentions, or other forward-looking information derived therefrom) will be achieved.

13 

Table of Contents  

The Company undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

Business Strategy

During 2016, the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board  or  Board of Directors ) considered and intended to pursue, subject to budget and cash constraints, potential acquisition and possibly joint venture and investment opportunities (particularly those in the health care technology, products and services and life sciences arenas) ( Opportunities ) that may have come to the attention of Board members or management, including Opportunities introduced by Dr. Pearce or his network of contacts. None of the Opportunities came to fruition.

On September 6, 2016, the Board of Directors unanimously approved a Plan of Dissolution subject to approval of a majority of the stockholders of the Company. On November   14  , 2016, the Majority Stockholder, which holds approximately 96% of the voting power of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock and all of the outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock consented in writing under Section 228 of the DGCL approving adoption of the Plan of Dissolution.  Accordingly, no vote of any other stockholder is necessary and stockholder votes on this matter will be solicited. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The Company s cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 aggregated $706,698 which management believes, based on the Company s recent and expected operating expenses and internally prepared  6 -month Cash Budget, will be sufficient to fund the Company s working capital requirements through March 31, 2017, but will not be sufficient to repay the $3,063,424 principal amount and accrued interest thereon as of September 30, 2016 due on March 31, 2017 in connection with the December 2015 Parkson Replacement Note and the 2014 Combined Promissory Note.   As previously reported i n the Company s December 2015 8--K and 8-K/A and as discussed above under Note 3 ( Notes Payable to Related Parties ) to the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in December 2015 the Company received the December 2015 Loan in the principal amount of $100,000, on the terms disclosed (including a 2.50% interest rate and maturity date for principal and all accrued interest of March 31, 2017) from  the Majority Stockholder Trust.   In the event (a) the Company does not generate revenue or income sufficient to fund its operations, activities and expenses, or (b) t hird-party funding or financing does not become available to the Company on terms acceptable to the Company prior to the Company exhausting its existing cash and cash equivalents, the Company will not be able (1) to pay-off its existing indebtedness when it matures (on March 31, 2017), or (2) to fund its working capital, operations or related expenses  . As a result of  the  approved plan of dissolution,   the Majority Stockholder Trust (  or any other affiliate of Dr. Pearce   or any other party  ) does not intend   to   make further advances or   extend the maturity dates on   any   existing indebtedness  .

The Company s total assets decreased from approximately $964,000 at the end of 2015 to approximately $723,000 at September 30, 2016, primarily due to the sale of the Parkson Property and payoff of the Bay Colony mortgage, reflecting the increase of cash and cash equivalents, an increase of prepaid expenses, offset by a decrease in property held for sale.

The Company s working capital decreased from approximately $511,000 at the end of 2015 to a deficit of approximately $2,416,000 at September 30, 2016, primarily reflecting a reclassification of the $3,063,424 principal amount due in connection with the  December 2015 Parkson Replacement Note and the 2015 Combined Promissory Note and related accrued interest payable of $57,702 (previously classified as long-term notes payable and long-term accrued interest as of December 31, 2015), each of which is scheduled to  mature on March, 31 2017, as a short-term liability (notes payable and accrued interest) and the increase of approximately $158,000 in cash and cash equivalents provided by the sale of the Parkson Property, an increase in prepaid expenses of approximately $1,000, and a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued expenses of approximately $12,000.
