    NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    

  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1    ORGANIZATION
AND PRINCIPAL ACTIVITIES    

Ziwira Inc. ( Ziwira  or  Company )
was established on January 21, 2015 in the State of Delaware.  The Company currently has authorized 250,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001.  The Company intends  to operate an online portal for
green industry topics, products and services. The Company has acquired a web-based platform that acts as a green energy portal,
where users can exchange ideas and information, and can also buy and sell environmentally friendly services and products. The Company
plans to receive fees for advertisement from users and a commission when products or services are purchased on the platform between
users.   

The Company s current business plans
include developing its online platform, in order to feature information, user services and products, and also grow its user base.
The Company s immediate plan is to generate revenue by way of receiving commissions and subscription fees from users, with
the goal of becoming a one stop shop of information, products and services in the green industry. The Company intends to provide
the platform whereby green information, products and services may be shared, bought and sold between users. The terms website,
platform, marketplace and portal are used interchangeably in this prospectus. 

NOTE 2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION
AND GOING CONCERN  

The financial statements are presented
in United States dollars ( USD). 

The Company operates in one segment in
accordance with accounting guidance Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) ASC Topic 280,  Segment Reporting .
Our Chief Executive Officer has been identified as the chief operating decision maker as defined by FASB ASC Topic 280. 

The Accounting Standards Codification ( Codification 
or  ASC ) is the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental
entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
( GAAP ). 

The unaudited interim financial statements
as of October 31, 2016, and for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information on the same basis as the annual financial
statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary
to present fairly the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of
operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year or for any future period. They
do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these unaudited
interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto for
the year ended January 31, 2016 filed in a Form 10-K on July 13, 2016. 

Going Concern   

The accompanying unaudited interim
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among
other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business.  The
Company had a working capital deficit of $900,217 at  October 31, 2016  and had net losses of
$114,075 and $423,365 for the three  and nine  months ended  October 31, 2016 ,
with minimal revenue earned , and a lack of operational history. These matters, among others, raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern. 

While the Company is attempting to commence
operations and generate revenues, the Company s cash position may not be significant enough to support the Company s
daily operations. Management intends to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. Management believes that
the actions presently being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for the
Company to continue as a going concern. While the Company believes in the viability of its strategy to generate revenues and in
its ability to raise additional funds, there can be no assurances to that effect. The ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to further implement its business plan and generate revenues. 

The  unaudited
interim  financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is
unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE 3    SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Revenue Recognition   

Revenue is principally derived from portal
membership and advertising services. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales discounts, when: (1) persuasive evidence exists
of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided; (2)
delivery has occurred or services have been provided; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured.
For all revenue transactions, the Company considers customer registration, payment, or third party acknowledgement to be persuasive
evidence of an arrangement. Sales taxes collected, if any, from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented
on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the Statements of Operations. 

Membership revenue  

The Company generates membership revenue
through an online registration process to its Business Blogger Association ( BBA ), which allows members access to
a web-based marketing and advertising support product that provides access to the Company s database of materials of similar
companies. The Company does not retransmit or distribute content. 

Membership to the BBA is for a period of
one month and membership revenue is recognized in the month of purchase.  All membership fees are collected
at the time of purchase.  

NOTE 4    INTANGIBLE
ASSETS   

Internet Portal   

Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement
dated October 24, 2015, the Company acquired all of the rights, title, and interest in the Company s Internet Portal from
an entity controlled by the Company s previous CEO, Dliar Adam Merza, who at the time of acquisition was a majority shareholder
of the Company, in exchange for a convertible note payable (see Note 5). The asset acquisition was accounted for as a purchase
of assets in accordance with ASC 805-10-55-4. The Company treated this transaction as an acquisition of assets under common control
and as such the asset is accounted for using the historical carryover basis under US GAAP which is $539,154. The excess cost of
$59,906 was accounted for as an accrued distribution to the stockholder. 

ASC 350-50 requires expensing of all costs
of the preliminary project stage and the training and application maintenance stage and the capitalization of all internal or external
direct costs incurred during the application and infrastructure development stage. Upgrades or enhancements that add functionality
are capitalized while other costs during the operating stage are expensed as incurred. The Company evaluated the historical carry
over cost under ASC 350-50 and accounted for $539,154 as intangible assets which are considered to have an estimated life of three
years. The total net book value of the intangible asset as of October 31, 2016 is $359,434. 

The Company
recorded amortization expense of $44,930 and $134,790 for the three  and nine  months ended  October
31, 2016, respectively, and  $44,930 for the year ended January 31, 2016 as  the Company has launched
its website and begun to market its products. 

Website Development Costs   

The Company evaluated the cost incurred
and pursuant to ASC 350-50 capitalized $26,746 as website development under intangible assets  in the
accompanying Balance Sheet at October 31, 2016. Website development costs  are expected to have an estimated life of three
years. 

Intangible assets consisted of the following:  

NOTE 5    Convertible
Promissory Note   RELATED PARTY   

On October 29, 2015, the Company issued
a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $599,060 for the purchase of the Company s Internet Portal from
the Company s former CEO, Dliar Adam Merza, who as of the date of purchase was considered to be a majority shareholder the
Company. The convertible promissory note bears interest at 10% per annum and is due and payable in two years. The holder of this
note has the right, at the holder s option, upon the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of the equity interest
in the Company or private placement transaction of the Company s equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities,
exclusive of the conversion of this note or any similar notes, to convert the principal amount of this note, in whole or in part,
plus any interest which accrues hereon, into fully paid and nonassessable shares at a conversion price of $0.35 per share. The
shares issued to the holder of this note on conversion shall have the same rights, preferences, privilege, and restrictions as
any other common shares issued. The principal balance due at  October 31, 2016  is $599,060 and
the accrued interest payable to related party is $61,219. The entire note and accrued interest balance is due on October 29, 2017
and is presented as a short term liability in the balance sheet as of October 31, 2016. 

The Company analyzed the conversion option
in the notes for derivative accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives and Hedging,  and determined that
the instrument does not qualify for derivative accounting. The Company therefore performed an analysis to determine if the conversion
option was subject to a beneficial conversion feature and determined that the instrument does not have a beneficial conversion
feature. 

NOTE 6    stockHOLDERS 
DEFICIT   

During the nine months ended October 31,
2016, the Company issued 105,000 shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $36,750 to Firas Khaleel Al Haddad, the
Company s CEO. Mr. Al Haddad subsequently transferred these shares to other individuals.

Consulting
Agreement    

On
December 15, 2015,   as amended July 27, 2016,  the
Company entered into a consulting agreement with Allan  Bradley ( Bradley), a founder, to manage our global operations .
The agreement is effective from January 1, 2016 and continues for 24 months. We agreed to pay Bradley a monthly consulting fee
of $10,000 for the first six (6) months and $5,000 per month for each month thereafter. In addition, should we achieve monthly
revenues of $425,000, Bradley s monthly consulting fee will increase to $17,500 and Bradley will be issued 500,000 shares
of our common stock. We incurred consulting fees of $15,000 and $83,229 for the three  and nine  months
ended October 31, 2016, and had an accounts payable   related party balance of $5,000 as of October 31, 2016.   

Limited
Operating History; Need for Additional Capital   

There
is no historical financial information about us on which to base an evaluation of our performance. To date, we have generated
minimal revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject
to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, and possible cost overruns
due to increases in the cost of services. To become profitable and competitive, we must receive additional capital. We have no
assurance that future financing will materialize. If that financing is not available we may be unable to continue operations.

Plan
of Operations   

We
have   begun our planned principal operations .
Operating revenues are expected to be significant in fiscal year 2017 as we  continue to develop our online marketplace
and mediatory trading platform that bundles environmental topics for eco-products and services, connecting buyers and sellers
with environmental products and people, and look to expand beyond the Middle East .   

13   

At
  October 31, 2016 and January 31, 2016, we had minimal cash to
no cash .   

How
We Generate Revenue   

We
recognize revenues in accordance with the guidelines of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Staff Accounting
Bulletin ( SAB ) No. 104  Revenue Recognition .  

Under
SAB 104, four conditions must be met before revenue can be recognized: (i) there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists,
(ii) delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, (iii) the price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably
assured.  

General
and administrative expenses consisted of professional service fees, and other general and administrative overhead costs. Expenses
are recognized when incurred.  

Depending
on the extent of our future growth, we may experience significant strain on our management, personnel, and information systems.
We will need to implement and improve operational, financial, and management information systems. In addition, we are implementing
new information systems that will provide better record-keeping, customer service and billing. However, there can be no assurance
that our management resources or information systems will be sufficient to manage any future growth in our business, and the failure
to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

Assets
were $389,318 as of  October 31, 2016 . Assets consisted of intangible assets of $386,180, net
of accumulated amortization of $179,720, and property and equipment (net of accumulated depreciation) of $616. Liabilities were
$902,739 as of  October 31, 2016 . Liabilities consisted of accounts payable of $18,980, accounts
payable   related party of $5,000, advances (net of repayments) from shareholders of $213,806, accrued interest payable
  related party of $61,219, cash overdraft of $4,674, and short-term convertible notes of $599,060.  

Assets
were $512,040 as of  January 31, 2016 . Assets consisted of intangible assets of $494,224, net

interest payable   related party of $16,248, and long-term convertible notes of $599,060.  

The
following is a summary of our cash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities during the periods
indicated:  

Cash
Flows from Operating Activities     For the nine months ended October 31, 2016, net cash used in operating activities
was $245,520. Net cash used in operations was primarily due to a net loss of $423,365 for the nine months ended October 31, 2016,
an increase in prepaid expenses of $2,522, and a decrease in accounts payable   related party of $5,000, offset primarily
by increases in accounts payable of $5,420, accrued interest payable   related party of $44,971, amortization expense of
$134,790, and depreciation expense of $186.  

For
the nine months ended October 31, 2015, net cash was primarily due to non- cash expenses paid by founders of $11,902, the non-cash
estimated fair value of stock issued for services of $1,500, the increase in accounts payable of $3,860, and the increase in accrued
interest payable   related party of $1,970, offset by a net loss of $19,232.  

Cash
Flows from Investing Activities     For the nine months ended October 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities
was $27,548 primarily due to the purchase of intangible assets   website of $26,746 and the purchase of equipment of $802.
 We had  no cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2015.  

15   

Cash
Flows from Financing Activities     For the nine months ended October 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities
was $255,230. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended October 31, 2016 was primarily due to the issuance
of common shares for cash of $36,750, advances from shareholders of $226,850, and cash overdraft of $4,674, partially offset by
repayments on advances from shareholders of $13,044.  We had  no cash provided by financing activities
for the nine months ended October 31, 2015.  

Financing
    We expect that our current working capital position, together with our expected future cash flows from operations
will be insufficient to fund our operations in the ordinary course of business, anticipated capital expenditures, debt payment
requirements and other contractual obligations for at least the next twelve months. However, this belief is based upon many assumptions
and is subject to numerous risks (see  Risk Factors ), and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional
funding in the future.  

We
have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses, products, product rights
or technologies or any other material capital expenditures. However, we will continue to evaluate acquisitions of and/or investments
in products, technologies, capital equipment or improvements or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions
and/or investments in the future. Accordingly, we may need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any
such acquisitions and/or investments. We may not be able to obtain such financing on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
Due to the ongoing global economic crisis, we believe it may be difficult to obtain additional financing if needed. Even if we
are able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or
cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing.  

Stock
Transactions   

During
the nine months ended October 31, 2016, we issued 105,000 shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $36,750 to Firas
Khaleel Al Haddad, the Company s CEO. Mr. Al Haddad subsequently transferred these shares to other individuals.  

In
December 2015 and January 2016, we issued 130,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $45,500 to Firas
Khaleel Al Haddad, our CEO. Mr. Al Haddad subsequently transferred these shares to four individuals.  

On
November 12, 2015, Dliar Adam Merza resigned from his positions as our CEO and a director. In conjunction with his resignation,
Mr. Merza returned 45,000,000 shares of our common stock for $0 consideration and were retired by us.  

On
November 3, 2015, we issued 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to a director, Haidar Al-Saadi, for director fees, valued at
$700,000 (based on current sales of common stock).  

On
February 22, 2015, we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party, pursuant to which we will be provided with outsourced
accounting solutions for 300,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $1,500 (based on the fair value of the services
on the date of grant) and $2,000 cash.  

On
February 4, 2015, we entered into an agreement with an unrelated third party, pursuant to which we will be provided with outsourced
legal services for 500,000 shares of restricted common stock, valued at $2,500 (based on the fair value of the services on the
date of grant) and $10,000 cash. The fair value of these shares and the cash paid were accounted as stock issued for deferred
offering costs which were expensed during the year ended January 31, 2016.  

On
January 21, 2015, we issued 99,200,000 restricted common shares to founder s, valued at $9,920 (based on the par value on
the date of grant). The issuance was an isolated transaction not involving a public offering pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933.  

On
January 21, 2015, our articles of incorporation were adopted. Pursuant to the articles of incorporation, we are authorized to
issue 250,000,000 shares of common stock, each having a par value of $0.0001, with each share of common stock entitled to one
vote for all matters on which a shareholder vote is required or requested.  

Asset
Purchase Agreement   

Pursuant
to an Asset Purchase Agreement dated October 29, 2015, we acquired all of the rights, title, and interest in our Internet Portal
from an entity controlled by our previous CEO, Dliar Adam Merza, who at the time of acquisition was a majority shareholder of
the Company, in exchange for a convertible note payable in the principal amount of $599,060. The asset acquisition was accounted
for as a purchase of assets in accordance with ASC 805-10-55-4. We treated this transaction as an acquisition of assets under
common control and as such the asset is accounted for using the historical carryover basis under US GAAP which is $539,154. The
excess cost of $59,906 was accounted for as an accrued distribution in the form of a related party convertible note. The convertible
promissory note bears interest at 10% per annum and is due and payable in two years. The holder of this note has the right, at
the holder s option, upon the consummation of a sale of all or substantially all of our equity interest or private placement
transaction of our equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, exclusive of the conversion of this note
or any similar notes, to convert the principal amount of this note, in whole or in part, plus any interest which accrues hereon,
into fully paid and nonassessable shares at a conversion price of $0.35 per share. The shares issued to the holder of this note
on conversion shall have the same rights, preferences, privilege, and restrictions as any other common shares issued. The principal
balance due at  October 31, 2016  is $599,060 and the accrued interest payable to related party
is $61,219. The entire note and accrued interest balance is due on October 29, 2017 and is presented as a short term liability
in the balance sheet.  

16   

The
Company analyzed the conversion option in the notes for derivative accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815,  Derivatives
and Hedging,  and determined that the instrument does not qualify for derivative accounting. The Company therefore performed
an analysis to determine if the conversion option was subject to a beneficial conversion feature and determined that the instrument
does not have a beneficial conversion feature.  

ASC
350-50 requires the expensing of all costs of the preliminary project stage and the training and application maintenance stage
and the capitalization of all internal or external direct costs incurred during the application and infrastructure development
stage. Upgrades or enhancements that add functionality are capitalized while other costs during the operating stage are expensed
as incurred. The Company evaluated the historical carry over cost under ASC 350-50 and accounted for $539,154 as intangible assets
which are considered to have an estimated life of three years. The total net book value of this intangible asset as of  October
31, 2016  is $359,434, net of $179,720 of amortization.  

Website
Development Costs   

We
evaluated the cost incurred and pursuant to ASC 350-50 capitalized $26,746 as website development under intangible assets  in
the accompanying Balance Sheet at October 31, 2016. Website development costs  are expected to have an estimated life of
three years.  

Capital
Expenditures   

Other
Capital Expenditures   

We
expect to purchase approximately $125,000 of equipment in connection with the expansion of our business.  

Fiscal
year end   

Our
fiscal year end is   January 31 .   

Going
Concern   

We
had a working capital deficit of $900,217 at October 31, 2016 and had net losses of $114,075 and $423,365 for the three   and
nine  months ended October 31, 2016, respectively, and cash used in operating activities for the nine
months ended October 31, 2016, with minimal revenue earned since inception , and a lack of operational history .   

While
we are attempting to commence operations and generate revenues, our cash position may not be significant enough to support our
daily operations. We intend to raise additional funds by way of a public or private offering. We believe that the actions presently
being taken to further implement its business plan and generate revenues provide the opportunity for us to continue as a going
concern. While we believe in the viability of our strategy to generate revenues and in its ability to raise additional funds,
there can be no assurances to that effect. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to further
implement our business plan and generate revenues.  

The
unaudited interim financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as
a going concern.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

The
Commission has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of
our financial condition and results of operations and which require us to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often
as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified
the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key accounting policies that are significant
to understanding our results.  

The
following are deemed to be the most significant accounting policies affecting us.  

17   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of these  unaudited interim  financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the  unaudited
interim  financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods. Actual results
may differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to the  unaudited interim 
financial statements. The more significant estimates and assumptions by management include among others: property and equipment,
foreign currency transactions and translations, and common stock valuation. The current economic environment has increased the
degree of uncertainty inherent in these estimates and assumptions.  

Intangible
Assets   

Acquired
intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives unless the lives are determined to be indefinite.
Acquired intangible assets are carried at cost, less accumulated amortization. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination
or received in a nonmonetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets received (or, for non-monetary exchanges, the estimated
fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident) are used to establish the cost basis, except when neither of the
values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non-monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits. Valuation
techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. Amortization
of finite-lived intangible assets is computed over an estimated three year useful life.  

As
of  October 31, 2016 , we have recognized $539,154 as intangible asset   website representing
the historical carryover basis in a website acquired from a majority owner of the Company.  We recorded
amortization expense of $44,930 and $134,790 for the three  and nine  months ended October 31,
2016 as  we have launched our website and begun to market our products.  

We
evaluated the cost incurred and pursuant to ASC 350-50 capitalized $26,746 as website development under intangible assets  in
the accompanying Balance Sheet at October 31, 2016. Website development costs  are expected to have an estimated life of
three years.  

Derivative
Financial Instruments   

We
evaluate our financial instruments to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded
derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially
recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements
of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments, we use a Black-Scholes option pricing model, in accordance with
ASC 815-15  Derivative and Hedging  to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent valuation dates.
The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity,
is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance sheet as current
or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within 12 months of
the balance sheet date.  

Beneficial
Conversion Features   

The
intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted
for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash upon conversion, is treated as a discount to the
convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using
the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the end of its contractual term, the unamortized discount
is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general, the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing
the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing
transaction, if any, to the fair value of the common shares at the commitment date to be received upon conversion.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenue
is principally derived from portal membership and advertising services. The Company recognizes revenue, net of sales discounts,
when: (1) persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which products
or services will be provided; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been provided; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable;
and (4) collection is reasonably assured. For all revenue transactions, the Company considers customer registration, payment,
or third party acknowledgement to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Sales taxes collected, if any, from customers and
remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis and therefore are excluded from revenues in the Statements of
Operations.  

Membership
revenue   

The
Company generates membership revenue through an online registration process to its Business Blogger Association ( BBA ),
which allows members access to a web-based marketing and advertising support product that provides access to the Company s
database of materials of similar companies. The Company does not retransmit or distribute content.  

18   

Membership to the BBA is for a period of
one month and membership revenue is recognized in the month of purchase.  All membership fees are collected
at the time of purchase.  

Equity Instruments Issued to Non-Employees
for Acquiring Goods or Services  

Issuances of
the Company s common stock or warrants for acquiring goods or services are measured at the fair value of the consideration
received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The measurement date for the
fair value of the equity instruments issued to consultants or vendors is determined at the earlier of (i) the date at which a commitment
for performance to earn the equity instruments is reached (a  performance commitment  which would include a penalty
considered to be of a magnitude that is a sufficiently large disincentive for nonperformance) or (ii) the date at which performance
is complete. When it is appropriate for the Company to recognize the cost of a transaction during financial reporting periods prior
to the measurement date, for purposes of recognition of costs during those periods, the equity instrument is measured at the then-current
fair values at each of those interim financial reporting dates.  For the three and  nine months
ended October 31, 2016 and  2015 , the Company recorded $0 and $0, and $1,357 and $14,512, respectively,
for equity instruments issued to non-employees for acquiring goods or services.  

Stock Based Compensation  

For purposes
of determining the variables used in the calculation of stock compensation expense under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 505,
  Equity   and FASB ASC Topic 718,   Compensation   Stock Compensation,   we perform an
analysis of current market data and historical Company data to calculate an estimate of implied volatility, the expected term of
the option and the expected forfeiture rate. With the exception of the expected forfeiture rate, which is not an input, we use
these estimates as variables in the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Depending upon the number of stock options granted, any
fluctuations in these calculations could have a material effect on the results presented in our statements of operations and comprehensive
income. In addition, any differences between estimated forfeitures and actual forfeitures could also have a material impact on
our unaudited interim financial statements.  For the three and  nine months ended October 31, 2016
and  2015 , the Company recorded $0 and $0 and $0 and $1,500, respectively, for common stock issued
for services.  

Non-Cash Equity Transactions   

Shares of equity instruments issued for
non-cash consideration are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received based on the market value of services to be
rendered, or at the value of the stock given, considered in reference to contemporaneous cash sale of stock. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

We apply the provisions of accounting guidance,
FASB Topic ASC 825 that requires all entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities
recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, and defines fair value
of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.
As of October 31, 2016, we had no assets or liabilities that required fair value accounting. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)
  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which provides guidance
regarding management s responsibility to assess whether substantial doubt exists regarding the ability to continue as a going
concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim
reporting period, management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements
are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). This ASU
is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company
does not expect that the adoption of this ASU to have a material effect on the Company s financial position, operations,
or cash flows. 

In June 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-10,  Development Stage
Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities
Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation.  This ASU removes the definition of a development stage entity from the ASC, thereby
removing the financial reporting distinction between development stage entities and other reporting entities from GAAP. In addition,
the ASU eliminates the requirements for development stage entities to (1) present inception-to-date information in the statements
of operations, cash flows, and stockholders  equity, (2) label the financial statements as those of a development stage entity,
(3) disclose a description of the development stage activities in which the entity is engaged, and (4) disclose in the first year
in which the entity is no longer a development stage entity that in prior years it had been in the development stage. In addition,
ASU 2014-10 requires an entity that has not commenced principal operations to provide disclosures about the risks and uncertainties
related to the activities in which the entity is currently engaged and an understanding of what those activities are being directed
toward. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods therein. Early
adoption is permitted. We have elected to adopt this ASU and its adoption resulted in the removal of previously required development
stage disclosures. Adoption of this ASU did not impact our financial position, operations or cash flows. 

Future Contractual Obligations and
Commitment  

We incur contractual
obligations and financial commitments in the normal course of our operations and financing activities. Contractual obligations
include future cash payments required under existing contracts, such as debt and lease agreements. These obligations may result
from both general financing activities and from commercial arrangements that are directly supported by related operating activities. 

Consulting Agreement   

On December
15, 2015,  as amended July 27, 2016,  the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Allan
 Bradley ( Bradley), a founder, to manage our global operations . The agreement is effective
from January 1, 2016 and continues for 24 months. We agreed to pay Bradley a monthly consulting fee of $10,000 for the first six
(6) months and $5,000 per month for each month thereafter. In addition, should we achieve monthly revenues of $425,000, Bradley s
monthly consulting fee will increase to $17,500 and Bradley will be issued 500,000 shares of our common stock. We incurred consulting
fees of $15,000 and $83,229 for the three  and nine  months ended October 31, 2016, respectively,
and had an accounts payable   related party balance of $5,000 as of October 31, 2016.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of  October
31, 2016 , w e have not entered into any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement
with an entity unconsolidated under which it has:  

a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to the unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit;   

liquidity or market risk support to such entity for such assets;   

an obligation, including a contingent obligation, under a contract that would be accounted for as a derivative instrument; or   

an obligation, including a contingent obligation, arising out of a variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that is held by, and material to us, where such entity provides financing, liquidity, market risk or credit risk support to or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development services with us.   

Inflation  

We
do not believe that inflation has had a material  effect on our results of operations. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

As a  smaller  reporting  company 
as defined by Item 10 of Regulation  S-K, the Company is not required to provide information required by this Item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

The Company s management conducted
an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e) under the 1934 Act) pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the 1934 Act.  The Company s disclosure controls
and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports it files or submits under the 1934
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis and that such information is communicated to management and
the Company s board of directors to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Based on this evaluation, it has been concluded that the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective since the following material weaknesses exist: 

Our chief executive
officer also functions as our chief financial officer.  As a result, our officers may not be able to identify errors and irregularities
in the financial statements and reports.  

We were unable
to maintain full segregation of duties within our financial operations due to our reliance on limited personnel in the finance
function.  While this control deficiency did not result in any material adjustments to our financial statements, it could
have resulted in a material misstatement that might have been prevented or detected by a segregation of duties.  

Documentation
of all proper accounting procedures is not yet complete.  

To the extent reasonably possible given our limited resources,
as financial resources become available we intend to take measures to cure the aforementioned weaknesses, including, but not limited
to, the following: 

Increasing the
capacity of our qualified financial personnel to ensure that accounting policies and procedures are consistent across the organization
and that we have adequate control over financial statement disclosures.  

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

There are no legal proceedings, to which
we are a party, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

As a smaller reporting company, we are
not required to provide this information. 

ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY
SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS . 

During the nine months ended October 31,
2016, the Company issued 105,000 shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of $36,750 to Firas Khaleel Al Haddad, the
Company s CEO.

SECURITIES  

None.
