      Table of Contents             PART I   FINANCIAL INFORMATION       This Quarterly Report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). These statements are based on management s beliefs and assumptions, and on information currently available to management. Forward looking statements include the information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations set forth under the heading:  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Forward looking statements also include statements in which words such as  expect,   anticipate,   intend,   plan,   believe,   estimate,   consider  or similar expressions are used.     Forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our future results and shareholder values may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to put undue reliance on any forward looking statements.

      Table of Contents          Premier Biomedical, Inc.   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  (Unaudited)        Note 1   Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies       Basis of Presentation    The accompanying unaudited, condensed financial statements of Premier Biomedical, Inc. ( the Company ) have been prepared pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and, therefore, do not include all information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited financial statements. However, these statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which in the opinion of management are necessary for fair presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.      Use of Estimates    The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Cash and Cash Equivalents    The Company maintains cash balances in non-interest-bearing accounts, which do not currently exceed federally insured limits. For the purpose of the statements of cash flows, all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents.      Patent Rights and Applications    Patent rights and applications costs include the acquisition costs and costs incurred for the filing of patents. Patent rights and applications are amortized on a straight-line basis over the legal life of the patent rights beginning at the time the patents are approved. Patent costs for unsuccessful patent applications are expensed when the application is terminated.      Fair Value of Financial Instruments   Under FASB ASC 820-10-05, the Financial Accounting Standards Board establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. This Statement reaffirms that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company s financial statements as reflected herein. The carrying amounts of cash, prepaid expenses and accrued expenses reported on the balance sheet are estimated by management to approximate fair value primarily due to the short term nature of the instruments.      Basic and Diluted Loss Per Share    The basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per common share is computed by dividing the net loss adjusted on an  as if converted  basis, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potential dilutive securities. For the periods presented, potential dilutive securities had an anti-dilutive effect and were not included in the calculation of diluted net loss per common share.                  6       
      Table of Contents             Premier Biomedical, Inc.   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  (Unaudited)      Stock-Based Compensation   Under FASB ASC 718-10-30-2, all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. The Company s stock based compensation consisted of the following during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:            Revenue Recognition    Sales on fixed price contracts are recorded when services are earned, the earnings process is complete or substantially complete, and the revenue is measurable and collectability is reasonably assured. Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded. The Company defers any revenue from sales in which payment has been received, but the earnings process has not occurred. Sales have not yet commenced.      Advertising and Promotion    All costs associated with advertising and promoting products are expensed as incurred. These expenses were $67,216 and $40,874 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      Income Taxes   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided for significant deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not, that such asset will not be recovered through future operations.      Uncertain Tax Positions   In accordance with ASC 740,  Income Taxes  ( ASC 740 ), the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be capable of withstanding examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. These standards also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and transition.     Various taxing authorities periodically audit the Company s income tax returns. These audits include questions regarding the Company s tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income to various tax jurisdictions. In evaluating the exposures connected with these various tax filing positions, including state and local taxes, the Company records allowances for probable exposures. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which an allowance has been established, is audited and fully resolved. The Company has not yet undergone an examination by any taxing authorities.     The assessment of the Company s tax position relies on the judgment of management to estimate the exposures associated with the Company s various filing positions.                  7       
      Table of Contents             Premier Biomedical, Inc.   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  (Unaudited)       Recent Accounting Pronouncements   In August, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).

All entities may adopt the amendments in this Update earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial statements.     In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)  ( ASU 2016-09 ) .  The provisions of the update amend ASC Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation, and includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements, including accounting for the income tax consequences, estimates of forfeitures and classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, this update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial statements.     In March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).  The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Update 2014-09. Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial statements.

Earlier application is permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial statements.     In March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-04,  Liabilities Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products  (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force). Effective for public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial statements.     In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ), which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions.

This standard will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of ASU 2016-02 on its balance sheets, results of operations or cash flows. The Company is evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Company s financial statements.     No other new accounting pronouncements, issued or effective during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, have had or are expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements.                  8       
      Table of Contents           Premier Biomedical, Inc.   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  (Unaudited)      Note 2   Going Concern      As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company has no revenues, incurred net losses from operations resulting in an accumulated deficit of $12,350,179, and had negative working capital of ($822,850) at September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company is currently seeking additional sources of capital to fund short term operations. The Company, however, is dependent upon its ability to secure equity and/or debt financing and there are no assurances that the Company will be successful; therefore, without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.     The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any uncertainty as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements also do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.      Note 3   Related Parties       Accounts Payable      The Company owed $47,091 and $37,486 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, to entities owned by the Chairman of the Board of Directors. The amounts are related to patent costs and reimbursable expenses paid by the Chairman on behalf of the Company.     The Company owed $-0- and $3,265 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, to the Company s CEO for reimbursable expenses.     The Company owed $5,153 and $13,917 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, amongst members of the Company s Board of Directors for reimbursable expenses.      Notes Payable      On July 6, 2015, the Company received an unsecured loan in the amount of $10,000, due on demand, bearing interest at a simple interest rate of 8%, from the Company s CEO.     On July 6, 2015, the Company received an unsecured loan in the amount of $10,000, due on demand, bearing interest at a simple interest rate of 8%, from the Company s Chairman of the Board.     On July 6, 2015, the Company received an unsecured loan in the amount of $10,000, due on demand, bearing interest at a simple interest rate of 8%, from one of the Company s Directors.       Preferred Stock Issuances for Exercise of Preferred Stock Warrants      On January 29, 2016, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of series A preferred stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants by the Company s CEO at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $1,000.     On January 29, 2016, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of series A preferred stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants by the Company s Chairman of the Board at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $1,000.      Common Stock Issuances for Settlement of Accounts Payments      On March 28, 2016, upon the resignation of Richard Najarian as one of the members of our Board of Directors, the Company issued 600,000 shares of common stock to Mr. Najarian in settlement of $13,765 of outstanding expense reimbursements. The total fair value of the common stock was $9,120 based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the date of grant.                 9       
      Table of Contents           Premier Biomedical, Inc.   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  (Unaudited)        Note   4       Patent Rights and Applications      The Company amortizes its patent rights and applications on a straight line basis over the expected useful technological or economic life of the patents, which is typically 17 years from the legal approval of the patent applications when there is probable future economic benefits associated with the patent. The Company has elected to expense all of their patent rights and application costs due to difficulties associated with having to prove the value of their future economic benefits. All patent applications are currently pending and the Company has no patents that have yet been approved. It is the Company s policy that it performs reviews of the carrying value of its patent rights and applications on an annual basis.     On March 4, 2015, we entered into a Patent License Agreement ( PLA ) with the University of Texas at El Paso ( UTEP ) regarding our joint research and development of CTLA-4 Blockade with Metronomic Chemotherapy for the Treatment of Breast Cancer. This is the first PLA with UTEP following our Collaborative Agreement with them dated May 9, 2012, and memorializes the joint ownership of the applicable patent and the financial and other terms related thereto.     On June 19, 2015, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to this Agreement, pursuant to which we explicitly included Provisional Patent Application No. 62/161,116 entitled,  Anti-CTLA-4 Blockade  (the  Application ) under the definition of  Patent Rights  as set forth in the PLA. The Application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademarks Office on May 13, 2015; the underlying technology was invented by Robert Kirken and Georgialina Rodriguez, and is solely-owned by The Board of Regents of The University of Texas System.      Note 5   Fair Value of Financial Instruments      Under FASB ASC 820-10-5, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). The standard outlines a valuation framework and creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures. Under GAAP, certain assets and liabilities must be measured at fair value, and FASB ASC 820-10-50 details the disclosures that are required for items measured at fair value.      The Company has certain financial instruments that must be measured under the new fair value standard. The Company s financial assets and liabilities are measured using inputs from the three levels of the fair value hierarchy. The three levels are as follows:     Level 1 - Inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.     Level 2 - Inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates, yield curves, etc.), and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means (market corroborated inputs).     Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect our assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.              Premier Biomedical, Inc.   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  (Unaudited)       The following schedule summarizes the valuation of financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively:                 The fair values of our related party debts are deemed to approximate book value, and are considered Level 2 inputs as defined by ASC Topic 820-10-35.     There were no transfers of financial assets or liabilities between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 inputs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or the year ended December 31, 2015.             Premier Biomedical, Inc.   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  (Unaudited)      Note 6   Joint Venture      On September 13, 2016, we entered into an operating agreement to form a pain management joint venture company with Advanced Technologies Solutions (ATS), a company based in San Diego, California and owned by Ronald T. LaBorde, a member of our Board of Directors. The joint venture company, Premier Biomedical Pain Management Solutions, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company (PBPMS), will develop and market natural and cannabis-based generalized, neuropathic, and localized pain relief treatment products. We own 50% of PBPMS and ATS owns the other 50%, with 89% of the profits allocated to us and the remaining 11% of profits allocated to ATS. As part of the agreement with ATS, Mr. LaBorde was appointed a member of our Board of Directors.     PBPMS must enter into separate license agreements with us and ATS for the use of technology previously developed by both companies.

The beneficial conversion feature discount resulting from the conversion price of $0.042 below the market price on January 30, 2015 of $0.14 provided a value of $32,143, of which $-0- and $24,154 was amortized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.            Premier Biomedical, Inc.   Notes to Condensed Financial Statements  (Unaudited)      Typenex Co-Investment, LLC Convertible Note   On November 25, 2014, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with Typenex Co-Investment, LLC, pursuant to which we sold to Typenex a 10% Convertible Promissory Note ( First Typenex Note ) in the original principal amount of $86,500. The First Typenex Note has a maturity date of August 25, 2015, and is convertible into our common stock at the lesser of (i) $0.18 per share, or (ii) 70% (the  Conversion Factor ) multiplied by the Market Price (as defined in the Note). If the Market Price of our common stock falls below $0.10 per share after the issuance of the Note, the Conversion Factor will automatically be reduced by 5% for all conversions completed while the Market Price is below $0.10 per share. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as no Event of Default has occurred, the Conversion Price shall be not less than $0.0001 (the  Conversion Floor ). For the avoidance of doubt, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Conversion Floor shall not apply to any future Conversions and shall be of no further force or effect.     The shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the First Typenex Note are restricted securities as defined in Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933. The issuance of the First Typenex Note is exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder. The purchaser was an accredited and sophisticated investor, familiar with our operations, and there was no solicitation.     The Company evaluated the First Typenex Note and determined that the shares issuable pursuant to the conversion option were determinate due to the Fixed Conversion Price and, as such, does not constitute a derivative liability. The beneficial conversion feature discount resulting from the conversion price of $0.1019 below the market price on November 25, 2014 of $0.225 provided a value of $37,019, of which $-0- and $32,137 was amortized during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.      Note 8   Notes Payable, Related Parties      Notes payable, related parties consist of the following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively:           The Company recorded interest expense in the amount of $1,800 and $564 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively related to notes payable, related parties.

Judgment Payable   On July 28, 2016, the Third Judicial District Court of Salt Lake County in the State of Utah awarded Typenex Co-Investment, LLC a Default Judgment in the amount of $340,647, pursuant to a dispute over the number of warrants that Typenex was awarded with their convertible note entered into on November 25, 2014. The outstanding judgment award carries an interest rate of 22% until the judgment amount is paid in full. The Company has accrued the potential liability, and on October 10, 2016, we entered into a Warrant Purchase Agreement by and among Redwood Management, LLC, the Company and Typenex. Pursuant to this agreement, Redwood purchased the warrants from Typenex, and Typenex provided a Satisfaction of Judgment and Release of Garnishment to release the Writ of Garnishment Typenex had placed on our transfer agent. Redwood paid installment payments to Typenex in the aggregate amount of $300,000 through November of 2016 to settle the judgment. In conjunction with this transaction, we entered into an Exchange Agreement with Redwood whereby, in exchange for the warrants that Redwood purchased from Typenex, we issued a 10% Convertible Promissory Note to Redwood with a principal amount of $300,000. This settled the dispute with Typenex upon satisfaction of the payments to Typenex over various dates in October and November of 2016. A total of $13,141 of interest has been accrued as of September 30, 2016.

We may issue multiple purchase notices to Redwood, subject to these limitations, but we may not issue such a purchase notice to Redwood within ten (10) business days of the completion of funding under the prior purchase notice. We must have a registration statement in effect under the Securities Act that covers the resale of any shares of common stock sold to Redwood pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

Note 1  3     Income Taxes      The Company accounts for income taxes under FASB ASC 740-10, which requires use of the liability method. FASB ASC 740-10-25 provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based on the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes, referred to as temporary differences.     For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred a net operating loss and, accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been recorded. In addition, no benefit for income taxes has been recorded due to the uncertainty of the realization of any tax assets. At September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had approximately $4,144,500 and $2,662,993 of federal net operating losses, respectively. The net operating loss carry forwards, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2031.     The components of the Company s deferred tax asset are as follows:           Based on the available objective evidence, including the Company s history of losses, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will not be fully realizable. Accordingly, the Company provided for a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.     A reconciliation between the amounts of income tax benefit determined by applying the applicable U.S. and state statutory income tax rate to pre-tax loss is as follows:           In accordance with FASB ASC 740, the Company has evaluated its tax positions and determined there are no uncertain tax positions.

Settlement of Typenex Judgment   On October 10, 2016, we entered into a Warrant Purchase Agreement by and among Redwood Management, LLC (  Redwood  ), the Company and Typenex. Pursuant to this agreement, Redwood purchased the warrants from Typenex, and Typenex provided a Satisfaction of Judgment and Release of Garnishment to release the Writ of Garnishment Typenex had placed on our transfer agent. Redwood paid installment payments to Typenex in the aggregate amount of $300,000, which were completed on, or about November 10, 2016. We also entered into an Exchange Agreement with Redwood whereby, in exchange for the warrants that Redwood purchase from Typenex, we issued a 10% Convertible Promissory Note to Redwood with a principal amount of $300,000. This settled the dispute with Typenex.               ITEM 2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations       Our Management s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are forward-looking (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international, national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth; our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity; competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.     Although the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Statement reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and prospects.     The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon, and should be read in conjunction with, its unaudited financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.      Summary Overview      We are a research-based company that intends to discover and develop medical treatments for humans, specifically targeting the treatment of Cancer, Alzheimer s Disease  (AD),  Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis  (ALS/Lou Gehrig s Disease),  Blood Sepsis, Leukemia, and other life-threatening cancers, Multiple Sclerosis, Fibromyalgia, Neuropathic Pain and Traumatic Brain Injury.     On September 13, 2016, we entered into a pain management joint venture company with Advanced Technologies Solutions ( ATS ), a company based in San Diego, California. The joint venture company, Premier Biomedical Pain Management Solutions, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company ( PBPMS ), will develop and market natural and cannabis-based generalized, neuropathic, and localized pain relief treatment products. We anticipate that PBPMS will enter into license agreements with us and ATS to use certain intellectual property for the development of its pain relief treatment products. PBPMS has not yet entered into these license agreements.      We have begun work on two new pain relief products: a patch and a roll-on product. We have already developed pre-production units, we have 10,000 of the patch-prototype units, and have begun marketing for these products. We anticipate that we will begin sales of these products through our websites in January 2017.     We have not generated any revenue to date, and we do not currently have a product ready for market.              Going Concern      As a result of our financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In order to continue as a going concern we must effectively balance many factors and begin to generate revenue so that we can fund our operations from our sales and revenues. If we are not able to do this we may not be able to continue as an operating company. At our current revenue and burn rate, our cash on hand will last less than one month, and thus we must raise capital by issuing debt or through the sale of our stock. However, there is no assurance that our existing cash flow will be adequate to satisfy our existing operating expenses and capital requirements.      Results of Operations for the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015       Introduction      We had no revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. Our operating expenses were $151,159 and $528,270, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $140,247 and $2,253,664, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $10,912, or 8%, and a decrease of $1,725,394, or 77%, respectively. Our operating expenses consisted mostly of professional fees, and to a lesser extent general and administrative expenses and research and development costs.     Revenues and Net Operating Loss     Our revenue, operating expenses, net operating loss, and net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:                   Revenues      The Company was established on May 10, 2010, and has no revenues to date.      Research and Development      Research and development expenses were $46,056 and $105,742, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $59,734 and $233,407, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $13,678 and $127,665, or 23% and 55%, respectively. The expenses consisted of the continued research and development costs through our partners, specifically the University of Texas at El Paso related to the development of our patented technologies, and decreased because we slowed our efforts when our cash flow would not permit it. Our anti-cancer antibody drug has been successful in animal testing versus our competition. We now have ceased experimentation while we humanize the drug for humanized animal testing. We do not expect this drug to be ready for further testing until April 2017. We are currently focused on developing our pain management products through PBPMS.      General and Administrative      General and administrative expenses were $36,566 and $128,032, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $44,786 and $93,584, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of $8,220, or 18%, and an increase of $34,448, or 37%, respectively. The increase between the nine-month periods was primarily due to increased advertising and travel expenses, as diminished by our decreased advertising expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016.      Professional Fees       Professional fees expense was $68,537 and $ 294,496, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $35,727 and $ 1,926,673 , respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $32,810, or 92%, and a decrease of $1,632,177, or 85%, respectively. Amounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include the amortization of non-cash stock based compensation related to common stock warrants granted and the issuance of common stock for services rendered by consultants. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, professional fees consisted of $94,427 of stock based compensation, consisting of $19,595 of amortization expense on warrants issued to officers and directors, $16,032 of amortization expense on warrants issued to consultants and $58,800 of common stock issued to consultants for services rendered. Comparably, amounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 include the amortization of non-cash stock based compensation related to common stock warrants granted. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, professional fees also consisted of $1,810,367 of stock based compensation, consisting of $1,523,103 of amortization expense on warrants issued to officers and directors, and $287,264 of amortization expense on warrants issued to consultants.      Net Operating Loss      Net operating loss was $151,159 and $528,270, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $140,247 and $ 2,253,664, respectively, for the three and months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $10,912, or 8%, and a decrease of $1,725,394, or 77%, respectively. Net operating loss decreased for the nine month period, as set forth above, primarily due to a decrease in research and development expenses and compensation related to stock issuances for professional fees, while that was slightly diminished by an increased net loss during the three month period due to increased professional fees surrounding our legal issues with Typenex.             Other Expense      Other expense was $283,988 and $1,044,112, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $48,508 and $139,086, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $235,480 and $905,026, or 485% and 651%, respectively. The increase of other expense consisted of the accrual of a default judgment entered against us of $340,647 and an increase in interest expense from the issuance of notes payable in the last year.      Net Loss      Net loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $435,147 or ($0.00) per share, and $1,572,382 or ($0.01) per share, respectively, compared to $188,755 or ($0.01) per share, and $2,392,750 or ($0.11) per share, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net loss decreased for the nine month period, as set forth above, primarily due to a decrease in the issuance of stock based compensation and a decrease in research and development expenses, as diminished by increased interest and finance costs on debt financing and the entry of the default judgment. Net loss increased during the three month period, as set forth above, primarily due to the increased interest and finance costs on debt financing.       Liquidity and Capital Resources        Introduction      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, because we did not generate any revenues, we had negative operating cash flows. Our cash on hand as of September 30, 2016 was $27,821, which was derived from the sale of convertible promissory notes and sale of stock on our Stock Purchase Agreement with Redwood. Our monthly cash flow burn rate for 2015 was approximately $39,000, and our monthly burn rate through the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $45,000. Although we have moderate short term cash needs, as our operating expenses increase we will face strong medium to long term cash needs. We anticipate that these needs will be satisfied through the issuance of debt or the sale of our securities until such time as our cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs.      Our cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, are as follows:                  Our cash and total current assets decreased slightly because our operating losses and interest expenses exceeded the amount we were able to raise from sales of convertible notes and other securities. Our total current liabilities increased because of the sale of convertible notes. Our working capital deficit increased from $279,970 to $822,850, and our stockholders  deficit increased by $540,898 to $817,221.     In order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise significant capital from other sources. There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts.      Cash Requirements      Our cash on hand as of September 30, 2016 was $27,821. Based on our lack of revenues and current monthly burn rate of approximately $45,000 per month, we will need to continue to fund operations by raising capital from the sale of our stock and debt financings.      Sources and Uses of Cash       Operations      We had net cash used in operating activities of $(403,038) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $(269,206) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net cash consisted primarily of our net loss of $(1,572,382), offset primarily by amortization of debt discount of $645,365, stock based compensation of $74,832, and an increase in judgment payable of $340,647. Our accounts payable decreased by $21,790. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of our net loss of $(2,392,750), offset primarily by stock based compensation to related parties of $1,523,103, stock based compensation of $287,264, an increase in accounts payable of $151,958, and amortization of debt discounts of $126,892.      Investments      We had $3,536 net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and zero net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      Financing      Our net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $398,981, compared to $240,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which consisted primarily of proceeds from convertible notes payable of $417,500 and proceeds of $68,520 from sales of stock pursuant to our equity line of credit with Redwood Management, LLC, offset by repayments of convertible notes payable of $89,039.        ITEM 3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.              ITEM 4 Controls and Procedures        (a) Disclosure Controls and Procedures      We conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange Commission s rules and forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material weaknesses identified and described in our Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting filed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.     Our principal executive officers do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and our principal executive officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.      (b) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      No change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report, the three month period ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.             PART II   OTHER INFORMATION         ITEM 1 Legal Proceedings       On July 28, 2016, the Third Judicial Court of Salt Lake County in the State of Utah awarded Typenex Co-Investment, LLC (  Typenex  ) a default judgment against us in the amount of $340,647, pursuant to a dispute over the number of warrants that Typenex was awarded with their convertible note entered into on November 25, 2014.      While we believed their dispute was without merit, on October 10, 2016, we entered into a Warrant Purchase Agreement by and among Redwood Management, LLC (  Redwood  ), the Company and Typenex. Pursuant to this agreement, Redwood purchased the warrants from Typenex, and Typenex provided a Satisfaction of Judgment and Release of Garnishment to release the Writ of Garnishment Typenex had placed on our transfer agent. Redwood paid installment payments to Typenex in the aggregate amount of $300,000. We also entered into an Exchange Agreement with Redwood whereby, in exchange for the warrants that Redwood purchase from Typenex, we issued a 10% Convertible Promissory Note to Redwood with a principal amount of $300,000. This settled the dispute with Typenex.     In the ordinary course of business, we are from time to time involved in various pending or threatened legal actions. The litigation process is inherently uncertain and it is possible that the resolution of such matters might have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition and/or results of operations. However, in the opinion of our management, other than as set forth herein, matters currently pending or threatened against us are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.       ITEM 1A Risk Factors       As a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       ITEM 2 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds        10% Convertible Promissory Note      On October 10, 2016, we issued a 10% Convertible Promissory Note in the face amount of $300,000 (the   Note  ), to Redwood Management, LLC. The Note has a maturity date of October 10, 2017. The Note is convertible at any time after January 8, 2017 into our common stock at a conversion price equal to 60% of the lowest traded price of our common stock during the fifteen (15) trading days prior to the conversion date. The shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Note will be restricted securities as defined in Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Note can be prepaid by us at any time upon ten (10) days written notice to Redwood for a cash amount equal to the sum of the then outstanding principal amount of the Note and interest multiplied by 130%.     The issuance of the Note was exempt from registration pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D and Section 4(a)(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The purchaser was an accredited and sophisticated investor, familiar with our operations, and there was no solicitation.       ITEM 3 Defaults Upon Senior Securities       There have been no events which are required to be reported under this Item.              ITEM 4 Mine Safety Disclosures       Not applicable.       ITEM 5 Other Information       None.       ITEM 6 Exhibits       (a) Exhibits                    ____________________                   SIGNATURES       Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned thereunto duly authorized.
