Note 1      Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and reflect
all adjustments (which primarily include normal recurring accruals) which management believes are necessary to present fairly the
financial position, results of operations and cash flows. These statements, however, do not include all information and footnotes
necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States. Interim results may not necessarily be indicative of results that may be expected
for any other interim period or for the year as a whole. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited
consolidated financial statements and footnotes included in the annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015,
filed March 24, 2016 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

On October 4, 2016, the Company
effected a 1-for-7 reverse stock split of the Company's common stock. Each stockholder's percentage ownership and proportional
voting power remained unchanged as a result of the reverse stock split. All applicable share data, per share amounts, and related
information in these Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto have been adjusted retroactively to give effect
to the 1-for-7 reverse stock split. 

Note 2      Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Share  

Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed
using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per share is computed
using the weighted average number of common shares and potential dilutive common shares that were outstanding during the period.
Potential dilutive common shares consist of outstanding stock options, outstanding stock warrants, and convertible preferred stock. 

The following table sets forth the computation of
basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share: 

Options and warrants to purchase
265,001 and 267,184 shares of common stock for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, were not
included in the denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share because their effect would be antidilutive or because the shares
were deemed contingently issuable. Options and warrants to purchase 270,958 shares of common stock for the three months and nine
months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, were not included in the denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share because
their effect would be antidilutive or because the shares were deemed contingently issuable.

Note 3     Fair Value of Financial
Instruments  

Fair value can be measured using
valuation techniques such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income
or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). Accounting standards
utilize a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad
levels. The following is a brief description of those levels: 

Level 1:  
      Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2:  
      Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.   

Level 3:  
      Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions.   

The carrying amount and fair
value of the Company's financial instruments are approximately as follows: 

Long-term debt : The fair
value of the Company's term and revolver loans approximate carrying value as these loans were incurred within the past twelve months
and have variable market-based interest rates which reset every thirty days. The fair value of the Company's obligation for the
acquisition of its lunasin technology license approximates carrying value as this obligation is a zero-interest based obligation
discounted utilizing an interest rate factor comparable to the Company's market-based interest rate for its term and revolver loans.
The fair value of the Company's notes payable obligations approximates carrying value as these obligations were incurred within
the past eighteen months and have variable market-based interest rates which reset every ninety days. 

Note receivable : The
Company's note receivable is a variable rate residential mortgage-based financial instrument. An average of published interest
rate quotes for a fifteen-year residential jumbo mortgage, a comparable financial instrument, was used to estimate fair value of
this note receivable under a discounted cash flow model. 

Marketable securities :
The assets (trading securities) of the Company's Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan are recorded at fair value on a recurring
basis, and are presented within Other Assets in the consolidated balance sheets. 

The carrying value of other
financial instruments, including cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate fair value
due to their short maturities or variable-rate nature of their respective balances.

Note 4     Taxes  

The interim financial statement
provision (benefit) for income taxes is different from the amounts computed by applying the United States federal statutory income
tax rate of 34%. In summary, the reasons for these differences are as follows: 

During the second quarter of
2016 (and affirmed in the third quarter of 2016), the Company determined that it was more likely than not that federal and various
state net operating losses it expects to generate in 2016 will not be realized based on projections of future taxable income, estimated
reversals of existing taxable timing differences, and other considerations. Accordingly, the income tax provision for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 includes the impact of recording a total valuation allowance of $363,000 in the second and third
quarters of 2016 against the losses generated from a U.S. tax perspective. 

One of the Company's foreign
subsidiaries is presently under local country audit for alleged deficiencies (totaling approximately $800,000 plus interest at
20% per annum) in value-added tax (VAT) and withholding tax for the years 2004 through 2006. The Company, in consultation with
its legal counsel, believes that there are strong legal grounds that it is not liable to pay the majority of the alleged tax deficiencies.
As of December 31, 2010, management estimated and reserved approximately $185,000 in taxes and interest for resolution of this
matter and recorded this amount within Selling, General, and Administrative expense in the 2010 Consolidated Statement of Income.
In 2011, the Company made good faith deposits to the local tax authority under the tax agency's administrative judicial resolution
process. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management's estimated reserve (net of deposits) for this matter is approximately
$156,000 and $142,000, respectively. There has been no change in this matter during the first  nine months of 2016. 

In July 2010, the Company s
Reliv Europe subsidiary entered into a long-term performance-based incentive compensation agreement with the subsidiary s
senior managers. The valuation of the compensation agreement was an EBITDA-based formula derived from the subsidiary s financial
performance and vested in 20% annual increments which began in April 2011. The amount of the incentive, if any, increased or decreased
each quarter in accordance with a 24-month look-back of the subsidiary s financial performance and the vesting provisions.
For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, compensation expense associated with this incentive plan was $-0-
and $90,800, respectively. This compensation expense is presented in Selling, General and Administrative in the accompanying condensed
consolidated statements of net income (loss) and comprehensive income (loss). 

During the second quarter of
2015, the cumulative incentive amount of $756,800 became 100% vested, and concurrently, each of the subsidiary's senior managers
exercised 100% of his/her put option. In the aggregate, the Company and the managers agreed to settle the incentive obligation
whereby the Company: issued notes payable of approximately $424,000 in April 2015, issued 100,000 shares of Company common stock
(fair value at settlement of $117,000) in July 2015, and made cash payments of approximately $216,000 in July 2015. 

The notes payable issued by
the Company to the managers range in length from one to two years with quarterly payments of principal and interest beginning July
2015 and ending April 2017. The notes accrue interest at a floating interest rate based on the three-month pound LIBOR rate plus
3%. At September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the notes was approximately $101,000 and the interest rate was 3.49%.

Estimated maturities of debt at September 30, 2016
are as follows:  

Term loan and revolving
line agreements   

On September 30, 2015, the Company
entered into a series of lending agreements with a new primary lender which include agreements for a $3.25 million term loan and
a $3.5 million revolving credit facility. These lending agreements replace similar borrowings under agreements with the Company s
former primary lender. 

The $3.25 million term loan
is for a period of three years and requires monthly term loan payments, under a ten-year amortization, consisting of principal
of $27,080 plus interest with a balloon payment for the outstanding balance due and payable on September 30, 2018. The term loan's
interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.25% and was 2.744% at September 30, 2016. 

The $3.5 million revolving line
of credit agreement, dated September 30, 2015, accrues interest at a floating interest rate based on the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.25%
and had an original term of one year. Effective September 30, 2016, the revolving line of credit agreement was extended under similar
terms to April 30, 2018. As of September 30, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving line of credit. 

Borrowings under the lending
agreements are secured by all tangible and intangible assets of the Company, a whole life insurance policy on the life of the Company s
Chief Executive Officer, and by a mortgage on the real estate of the Company s headquarters. 

The original September 30, 2015
lending agreements include a quarterly covenant requiring the Company to maintain net tangible worth of not less than $9.5 million.
The September 30, 2016 revolving line of credit agreement extension adds a quarterly financial covenant under which the Company
will have: i) a quarterly minimum requirement of earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization
( EBITDA ) of $200,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016; ii) a cumulative minimum EBITDA requirement of $200,000,
$400,000, $600,000, and $800,000 for the fiscal periods ending March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December
31, 2017, respectively; and iii) a minimum EBITDA of $200,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. 

As defined, EBITDA means the
Company's consolidated net income for such period, before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization,
and management fees, and further adjusted to exclude any gain or loss on the sale of assets, other extraordinary gains or losses,
and any one-time adjustment approved by the lender. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company
was in compliance with its loan covenant requirements.

Note 6     Debt (continued)  

Obligation for Acquisition
of Technology License, net   

In July 2013, the Company entered
into a Technology License Agreement (TLA) with a privately-held company. The TLA provides the Company the exclusive license for
certain intellectual property related to the nutritional ingredient lunasin and other soy-related peptins and proteins. In consideration
for the TLA, the Company agreed to pay the licensor a purchase price of $2 million; $1.15 million paid in July 2013, with the remaining
obligation paid over the next four years in a series of annual payments ranging from $150,000 to $250,000. Subject to certain minimum
and maximum product sales thresholds, the Company may also have been required to pay the licensor royalties during the remaining
life of the intellectual properties (approximately seventeen years at origination). During the third quarter of 2016, the Company
made a scheduled $250,000 payment on this obligation. In addition, during the third quarter of 2016, the Company and licensor entered
into a letter agreement pursuant to which the Company paid licensor the final $250,000 payment, due in July 2017 per the original
agreement. In consideration for acceleration of the final payment, the licensor transferred all rights, title and interest in the
technology to the Company and terminated any future royalty obligations on the part of the Company. 

Notes Payable   

A description of the notes payable
is presented in Note 5   Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan. 

Note 7     Recent Accounting Standards
Pending Adoption  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which
requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or
services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing U.S. GAAP revenue recognition guidance and becomes effective for the
Company on January 1, 2018. The new standard permits the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective transition method.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and
related disclosures, as well as its planned transition method. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,  which requires all deferred income
tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current on the balance sheet, rather than being separated into current and non-current
amounts. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016 with early adoption permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern , which requires management
to assess, at each annual and interim reporting period, the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from
the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures. The new standard will be effective for the Company
for the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2016, with early adoption permitted. This standard is not currently expected
to have a material effect on the Company's financial statement disclosures upon adoption, though the ultimate impact will be dependent
on the Company's financial condition and expected operating outlook at such time. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-2,  Leases (Topic 842)  which supercedes the existing lease guidance. This update requires lessees to recognize
a lease liability and a lease asset for all leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than twelve months on its balance
sheet. The update also expands the required quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. Upon adoption, the Company
will be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
approach. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years,
with earlier application permitted. The Company is evaluating the effects that the new standard will have on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures.

Note 7     Recent Accounting Standards
Pending Adoption (continued)  

In March 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .
This amendment is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income
tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, forfeitures, and classification on the statement of
cash flows. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal
years, with earlier application permitted. The Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures. 

Note 8     Restructuring Activities  

In May 2016, the Company implemented
an employee headcount cost reduction program resulting in the reduction of approximately 9% of the Company's worldwide employees.
The total cost of this program, representing severance and benefits, was approximately $275,000, and was included in the company's
operating results for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The aggregate annual salaries of the affected employees was approximately
$1,100,000. 

At September 30, 2016, there
was no remaining reserve for severance and benefits under this program.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This quarterly report
includes both historical and  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future
results. Words such as  may,   should,   could,   would,   expect, 
 plan,   anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   predict,   potential, 
 continue,  or similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking
statements contain these words. Although we believe that our opinions and expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements
are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements, and our actual results may
differ substantially from the views and expectations set forth in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. We disclaim any intent or
obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this annual report to conform such statements to actual results
or to changes in our opinions or expectations. 

Item No. 2 - Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations   

The following discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes
included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The following discussion and analysis discusses the financial condition
and results of our operations on a consolidated basis, unless otherwise indicated.   

Overview   

We are a developer, manufacturer and marketer
of a proprietary line of nutritional supplements addressing basic nutrition, specific wellness needs, weight management and sports
nutrition. We sell our products through an international network marketing system utilizing independent distributors. Sales in
the United States represented approximately 78.0% of worldwide net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 78.1%
of worldwide net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our international operations currently generate sales through
distributor networks with facilities in Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom.
We also operate in Ireland, France, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands from our United Kingdom distribution center, in New Zealand
from our Australia office, and in Singapore from our Malaysia office. 

We derive our revenues principally through
product sales made by our global independent distributor base, which, as of September 30, 2016, consisted of approximately 40,450
distributors. Our sales can be affected by several factors, including our ability to attract new distributors and retain our existing
distributor base, our ability to properly train and motivate our distributor base and our ability to develop new products and successfully
maintain our current product line. 

All of our sales to distributors outside
the United States are made in the respective local currency; therefore, our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations
due to changes in foreign currency rates as compared to the U.S. dollar. As a result, exchange rate fluctuations may have
an effect on sales and gross margins. U.S. generally accepted accounting practices require that our results from operations be
converted to U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Consequently, our reported earnings may be significantly affected by fluctuations
in currency exchange rates, generally increasing with a weaker U.S. dollar and decreasing with a strengthening U.S. dollar.
Products manufactured by us for sale to our foreign subsidiaries are transacted in U.S. dollars. From time to time, we enter
into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate our foreign currency exchange risk. 

Components of Net Sales and Expense   

Product sales represent the actual product
purchase price typically paid by our distributors, after giving effect to distributor allowances, which can range from 20% to 40%
of suggested retail price, depending on the rank of a particular distributor. Handling and freight income represents the amounts
billed to distributors for shipping costs. We record net sales and the related commission expense when the merchandise is shipped. 

Our primary expenses include cost of products
sold, distributor royalties and commissions and selling, general and administrative expenses. 

12   

Cost of products sold primarily consists
of expenses related to raw materials, labor, quality control and overhead directly associated with production of our products and
sales materials, as well as shipping costs relating to the shipment of products to distributors, and duties and taxes associated
with product exports. Cost of products sold is impacted by the cost of the ingredients used in our products, the cost of shipping
distributors  orders, along with our efficiency in managing the production of our products. 

Distributor royalties and commissions are
monthly payments made to distributors based on products sold in their downline organization. Based on our distributor agreements,
these expenses have typically approximated 23% of sales at suggested retail. Wholesale pricing discounts on distributor orders
are based on the retail value of the product. Distributor royalties and commissions are paid on an amount referred to as the business
value ( BV ), which ranges from 50% to 90% of the retail price of each product. Also, we include other sales leadership
bonuses, such as Ambassador bonuses, within this caption. Overall, distributor royalties and commissions remain directly related
to the level of our sales and should continue at comparable levels as a percentage of net sales going forward. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses
include the compensation and benefits paid to our employees, except for those in manufacturing, all other selling expenses, marketing,
promotional expenses, travel and other corporate administrative expenses. These other corporate administrative expenses include
professional fees, non-manufacturing depreciation and amortization, occupancy costs, communication costs and other similar operating
expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses can be affected by a number of factors, including staffing levels and the
cost of providing competitive salaries and benefits; the amount we decide to invest in distributor training and motivational initiatives;
and the cost of regulatory compliance. 

Results of Operations   

Net Sales.  Overall net sales decreased
by 11.6% in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. During the third quarter of 2016 ( Q3
2016 ), sales in the United States decreased by 12.1%, and international sales decreased by 9.5% over the prior-year period.
International sales, when reported in U.S. dollars, were negatively impacted by a stronger U.S. dollar versus all of the currencies
of the markets where we do business. Excluding the impact of currency exchange fluctuation, international sales increased by 0.2%. 

For the nine-month period ended September
30, 2016 ( YTD 2016 ), net sales decreased by 11.7% compared to the same period in 2015. For YTD 2016, sales in the
United States decreased by 11.8%, and international sales decreased by 11.1% compared to the prior-year period. Excluding the impact
of currency exchange fluctuation, international sales decreased by 3.8%. 

The following
table summarizes net sales by geographic market for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

13   

The following table summarizes net sales
by geographic market for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The following table sets forth, as of September
30, 2016 and 2015, the number of our active distributors and Master Affiliates and above. The total number of active distributors
includes Master Affiliates and above. We define an active distributor as one that enrolls as a distributor or renews his or her
distributorship during the prior twelve months. Master Affiliates and above are distributors that have attained the highest level
of discount and are eligible for royalties generated by Master Affiliate groups in their downline organization. In February 2016,
we introduced a formal Preferred Customer program in the United States and Canada. As a result, we are including Preferred Customers
as part of our Active Distributor count. Preferred Customer programs were previously in place in Europe and other foreign markets.
Preferred Customers represent approximately 4,720 and 4,390 of the Active Distributor count as of September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The significant majority of these Preferred Customers are in Europe. 

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information  

Net sales expressed
in local currency or net sales adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuation are non-GAAP financial measures. We use
these measurements to assess the level of business activity in a foreign market, absent the impact of foreign currency fluctuation
relative to the United States dollar, which our local management has no ability to influence. This is a meaningful measurement
to management, and we believe this is a useful measurement to provide to shareholders. 

14   

The following table
provides key statistics related to distributor activity by market and should be read in conjunction with the following discussion.
Adjusted results should be considered only in conjunction with results reported according to accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. 

15   

United States  

Net sales declined in the United States in Q3 2016 and for YTD 2016 compared to the prior-year periods. We believe this decrease
is due in part to the changes made effective February 1, 2016 to our distributor compensation plan in the United States and Canada.   

Effective February 1, 2016, we updated our distributor compensation plan to introduce a Preferred Customer program and to modify
the requirements for a Retail Distributor (entry-level) to advance to the Affiliate distributor level. Advancement to Affiliate
distributor entitles a distributor to a higher discount on their purchases and the opportunity to earn retail and wholesale profits.
The updates to the distributor compensation plan also included adjustments to a distributor s group business volume required
to achieve the Master Affiliate level. We believe these changes enhance the value of the business opportunity to Master Affiliates
and distributors at levels below Master Affiliate; however, we continue to train the distributor field to understand the benefit
of these changes and to teach these concepts to their local distributor groups.   

Flagship products in the LunaRich line, including Reliv Now  and LunaRich X , constituted 17.7% and 15.6% of net
sales in the United States, respectively, in Q3 2016 as our marketing continues to focus on these two products. Reliv NOW and LunaRich
X represented 18.9% and 15.8%, respectively, of net sales in the United States in the prior-year quarter. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, sales of Reliv Now and LunaRich X represented 18.0% and 15.3%, respectively, of net sales in the United States.   

Distributor/preferred customer enrollments and new Master Affiliate qualifications decreased by 32.7% and 48.2%, respectively,
in Q3 2016 compared to the prior year quarter in response to the changes to the new distributor enrollment process and the increased
business volume requirements to reach the Master Affiliate level.   

Our average order size in Q3 2016 increased by 1.9% to $329 at suggested retail value compared to the prior-year quarter. However,
the number of product orders decreased by 14.5% in Q3 2016 compared to the prior year quarter for the same reasons as the overall
decrease in sales. For YTD 2016, our average order size increased by 1.5%; however, the number of product orders decreased by 13.8%.   

International Operations  

The average foreign exchange rate for the U.S. dollar for the first nine months of 2016 was stronger versus the various local
currencies in which we conduct business when compared with the average exchange rates for the same period in 2015.   

As a result of the stronger U.S. dollar, we have implemented price increases in all of our international markets. We are also
reviewing sales by product to phase out products with lower sales levels and gross margins as strategically appropriate.   

Canadian net sales in Q3 2016 decreased by 4.8% in local currency compared to the prior-year quarter as a result of decreased
distributor activity in the market. We implemented price increases effective April 1, 2016 in Canada.   

Net sales in Mexico decreased by 0.4% in local currency in Q3 2016 compared to the prior-year quarter. We implemented price
increases in this market on April 1, 2016, and distributor activity remains down as new distributor enrollments decreased by 29.9%
in Q3 2016 compared to the prior-year quarter.   

Sales in Asia decreased by 4.7% in local currency in Q3 2016 compared to the prior-year quarter. New distributor/preferred
customer enrollments decreased by 15.1% in Q3 2016 compared to the prior-year quarter.   

16   

Costs and Expenses  

The following table sets forth selected
results of our operations expressed as a percentage of net sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. Our results of operations for the periods described below are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for
future periods. 

(1)  All per share amounts have
been adjusted for the 1-for-7 reverse stock split effective on October 4, 2016. 

17   

Cost of Products Sold:  

The cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales
in Q3 2016 decreased compared to the prior-year quarter as the result of the workforce and cost reduction program implemented
in May 2016. For the first nine months of 2016 ( YTD 2016 ), the cost of products sold as a percentage of net sales
increased compared to the prior-year period. For the YTD 2016 period, the cost of products sold was negatively impacted by lower
plant utilization and higher quality control expenses. 

Distributor Royalties and Commissions:  

Distributor royalties and commissions as a percentage of net sales for Q3 2016 and YTD 2016 compared to the prior-year periods
remained relatively steady. Overall, distributor royalties and commissions remain directly related to the level of our sales and
should continue at comparable levels as a percentage of net sales.   

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses:  

Salaries, salary-related expenses, and incentive compensation decreased in the aggregate by $967,000 in YTD 2016, compared
to the prior-year period. Total compensation expense decreased as the result of continued headcount reductions in the United States
through attrition and a worldwide workforce reduction that took place in May 2016. This headcount reduction program eliminated
approximately 9 percent of the company's worldwide employees. The total cost of this program, representing severance and benefits,
was approximately $275,000, and is included in the company's operating results for the YTD 2016 period. The aggregate annual salaries
of the affected employees were approximately $1,100,000.   

Other general and administrative expenses decreased by $523,000 in YTD 2016 vs. the prior-year period. This reduction was the
result of both ongoing expense reductions, coupled with non-recurring expense items. Non-recurring expense items from the first
nine months of 2015 ( YTD 2015 ) include:   

o   Compensation expense recognized as part of a long-term incentive agreement with our management team in our European subsidiary
was $91,000 in YTD 2015. During Q2 2015, this long-term incentive agreement became 100% vested and the participants exercised their
put option in the agreement. This incentive agreement is described in Note 5 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   

o   In Mexico, we recognized expense of approximately $130,000 during Q2 2015 related to the write-off of VAT credits and VAT paid
on behalf of our distributors as part of an amnesty agreement related to the implementation of a new VAT arrangement in that country.   

 Significant ongoing expense reductions include: 

Offsetting increases include: 

o   Research   development expenses, along with other foreign product compliance requirements, increased by $165,000 in YTD
2016 compared to the prior-year period.   

o   $383,000 decrease in Star Director and other distributor bonuses, credit card fees, and other expenses related to the level
of sales.   

o   $190,000 decrease in distributor conferences and meeting expenses. Most of the decrease was the result of not holding regional
conferences in the United States during Q1 2016.   

o   $118,000 decrease in the cost of our promotional trips and other promotional incentives.   

Other Income/Expense:  

The other income in YTD 2016 is primarily the result of
foreign currency exchange gains on intercompany debt denominated in U.S. dollars in certain of our subsidiaries. In YTD 2015,
we recognized foreign currency exchange losses on the same intercompany debt. 

18   

Income Taxes/Benefit:  

During the second quarter of 2016, we determined that it was more likely than not that Federal and various state net operating
losses we expect to generate in 2016 will not be realized based on projections of future taxable income and other considerations.
Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, the tax provision for YTD 2016 includes the impact of recording a valuation allowance of
$363,000 against the losses generated from a U.S. tax perspective.   

See Note 4 of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional detail regarding income taxes, including a reconciliation
of the income tax expense/benefit to the U.S. statutory rate for each period.   

Net Income/Loss:  

For the third quarter of 2016, we had net income of $134,000, compared to a net loss of $289,000 in the prior-year quarter,
as we began to realize the savings from the headcount and cost reduction program implemented during the second quarter of 2016.
For the nine-month period of 2016, we continue to show a net loss, although smaller compared to the same period in 2015, as the
result of the decline in net sales in the United States and other foreign markets, coupled with the valuation allowance recorded
on the income tax benefit attributable to the YTD 2016 U.S. net loss.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

During the first nine months of 2016, we
generated $763,000 of net cash in operating activities, $59,000 was provided by investing activities, and we used $904,000 in financing
activities. This compares to $1.10 million used in operating activities, $145,000 used in investing activities, and $585,000 used
in financing activities in the same period of 2015. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $92,000 to $3.17 million as of
September 30, 2016 compared to $3.26 million as of December 31, 2015 and $3.16 million as of September 30, 2015. 

Significant changes in working capital items
consisted of a decrease in inventory of $868,000, and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $253,000 in the first
nine months of 2016. The decrease in inventory is the result of planned decreases in our inventory levels relative to sales, and
the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses is partially related to a financing arrangement for our annual corporate
insurance policy renewals. 

Investing activities during the first nine
months of 2016 consisted of $18,000 for net capital expenditures, offset by payments received on a distributor note receivable
of $77,000. Financing activities during the first nine months of 2016 consisted of principal payments of $904,000 on long-term
borrowings, including an accelerated final principal payment of $250,000 due under a Technology License Agreement entered into
in 2013. See Note 6 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a further description. 

Stockholders  equity decreased to
$14.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $15.9 million at December 31, 2015. The decrease is due to our net loss
during the first nine months of 2016 of $897,000 coupled with an unfavorable adjustment in foreign currency translation of $296,000.
Our working capital balance was $4.10 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $5.08 million at December 31, 2015. The current
ratio at September 30, 2016 was 1.89 compared to 2.08 at December 31, 2015. 

On September 30, 2015, we entered into series
of agreements with a new primary lender which included agreements for a $3.25 million term loan and a $3.5 million revolving credit
facility. These lending agreements replaced similar borrowings under agreements with our former primary lender. 

The $3.25 million term loan is for a period
of three years and requires monthly term loan payments, under a ten-year amortization, consisting of principal of $27,080 plus
interest with a balloon payment for the outstanding balance due and payable on September 30, 2018. The term loan's interest rate
is based on the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.25% and was 2.744% at September 30, 2016. 

The proceeds from the new $3.25 million
term loan were used to pay off the outstanding term loan and revolving line of credit balances, plus accrued interest, due under
loan agreements with our former primary lender. Borrowings under the new lending agreements are secured by all our tangible and
intangible assets, a whole life insurance policy on the life of our Chief Executive Officer, and by a mortgage on the real estate
of our headquarters. 

19   

The $3.5 million revolving line of credit
agreement accrues interest at a floating interest rate based on the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.25% and was renewed on September 30, 2016,
with a new maturity date of April 30, 2018. As of September 30, 2016, there were no outstanding borrowings on the revolving line
of credit. 

The original September 30, 2015 lending
agreements include a quarterly covenant requiring us to maintain net tangible worth of not less than $9.5 million. The September
30, 2016 revolving line of credit agreement extension adds a quarterly financial covenant under which we will have: i) a quarterly
minimum requirement of earnings before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA )
of $200,000 for the quarter ended December 31, 2016; ii) a cumulative minimum EBITDA requirement of $200,000, $400,000, $600,000,
and $800,000 for the fiscal periods ending March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, and December 31, 2017, respectively;
and iii) a minimum EBITDA of $200,000 for the quarter ended March 31, 2018. 

As defined, EBITDA means our consolidated
net income for such period, before interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization, and management fees, and
further adjusted to exclude any gain or loss on the sale of assets, other extraordinary gains or losses, and any one-time adjustment
approved by the lender. 

At September 30, 2016, we were in compliance
with all applicable covenants. 

Management believes that our cash on hand,
internally generated funds, and revolving line of credit extension will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and
our debt service requirements for the next twelve months. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

A summary of our critical accounting policies
and estimates is presented on pages 26-27 of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
on March 24, 2016. Our critical accounting policies remain unchanged as of September 30, 2016. 

Item No. 4 - Controls and Procedures 

Our management, under
the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has reviewed and evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on such
review and evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including the officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There were no material changes
in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected or are reasonably
likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

References in the boxes above are for Lender's
use only and do not limit the applicability of this document to any particular loan or item.

          RELIV' INTERNATIONAL, INC.; RELIV',
        INC.; RELIV' WORLD CORPORATION; and SL Technology, Inc.  
          136 Chesterfield Industrial Boulevard

          300 St. Peters Centre Boulevard  
          St. Peters, MO 63376    

DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS. 
A Promissory Note dated September 30, 2015 in the original amount of $3,500,000.00, as amended (the  Note ). 

DESCRIPTION OF COLLATERAL . collateral
described in a Deed of Trust and an Assignment of Rents dated September 30, 2015 on real property known as 136 Chesterfield Industrial
Boulevard, Chesterfield, MO 63005, and collateral described in an Assignment of Life Insurance Policy dated September 30, 2015
and four (4) Commercial Security Agreements each dated September 30, 2015. Failure to identify collateral for this Note shall not
constitute a waiver of such collateral. 

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE IN TERMS . The Note shall be amended
and modified as follows: The maturity date shall be extended from September 30, 2016 to April 30, 2018. 

PAYMENT. Borrower will pay this loan
in one payment of all outstanding principal plus all accrued unpaid interest on April 30, 2018. In addition, Borrower will pay
regular monthly payments of all accrued unpaid interest due as of each payment date, beginning October 30, 2016, with all subsequent
interest payments to be due on the same day of each month after that.  

VARIABLE IINTEREST RATE.  The interest
rate on this loan is subject to change from time to time based on changes in an independent index which is rate per annum equal
to the ICE London Interbank Offered Rate in United State dollars for a thirty (30) day period as it appears in the Wall Street
Journal, Money Rates Section, adjusted for any reserve requirement and any subsequent costs arising from a change in government
regulation. The initial LIBOR Rate applicable hereunder shall be the LIBOR Rate in effect on the first Business Day of the calendar
month in which this Note is dated. The LIBOR Rate shall be adjusted on that date which is thirty (30) days following the date of
this Note. And again subsequently adjusted on every thirty (30) day anniversary period occurring thereafter until all indebtedness
owing under the Note is paid in full using the LIBOR Rate in effect on the first Business Day of the calendar month in which each
LIBOR Rate adjustment occurs. As used herein  Wall Street Journal Money Rates Section  means the display page currently
so designated on the Wall Street Journal Money Rates Section (or such other page or such other service as may replace Wall Street
Journal Money Rates Section). Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the LIBOR Rate be deemed to be less than zero. As
used herein  Business Day  shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday in which banks are authorized
or required to be closed for the conduct of commercial banking business in St. Louis, Missouri. Lender's internal records of applicable
interest rates shall be determinative in the absence of manifest error. The independent index described herein sometimes referred
to as the index (the  Index ). The Index is not necessarily the lowest rate charged by Lender on its loans. If the Index
becomes unavailable during the term of this loan, Lender may designate a substitute index after notifying Borrower. Lender will
tell Borrower the current Index rate upon Borrower's request. The interest rate change will not occur more often than each month.
Borrower understands that Lender may make loans based on other rates as well.  The Index currently is  0.494%
 per annum.  Interest on the unpaid principal balance of this loan will be calculated as described in the  IINTEREST
CALCULATION METHOD  paragraph using a rate of 2.250 percentage points over the Index, resulting in an initial rate of  2.744%.
 NOTICE: Under no circumstances will the interest rate on this loan be more than the maximum rate allowed by applicable law. 

INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD. Interest
on the loan is computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied
by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding. All interest
payable under this loan is computed using this method. This calculation method results in a higher effective interest rate than
the numeric interest rate stated in the loan documents.   

CONTINUING VALIDITY.  Except as expressly
changed by this Agreement, the terms of the original obligation or obligations, including all agreements evidenced or securing
the obligation(s), remain unchanged and in full force and effect. Consent by Lender to this Agreement does not waive Lender s
right to strict performance of the obligation(s) as changed, nor obligate Lender to make any future change in terms. Nothing in
this Agreement  will  constitute a satisfaction of the obligation(s). It is the intention of
Lender to retain as liable parties all makers and endorsers of the original obligation(s), including accommodation parties, unless
a party is expressly released by Lender in writing. Any maker or endorser, including accommodation makers, will not be released
by virtue this Agreement. If any person who signed the original obligation does not sign this Agreement below, then all persons
signing below acknowledge that this Agreement is given conditionally, based on the representation to Lender that the non-signing
party consents to the changes and provisions of this Agreement or otherwise  will  not be released
by it. This waiver applies not only to any initial extension, modification or release, but also to all such subsequent actions. 

ELECTRONIC TRANSMISSION OF SIGNATURE. 
This Change in Terms Agreement may be signed and transmitted electronically by facsimile machine or telecopier; the signature of
any person on an electronically including without limitation, as a portable digital format document (.pdf) or facsimile transmitted
copy hereof shall be considered an original signature; and an electronically or facsimile transmitted copy hereof shall have the
same binding effect as an original signature on an original document. At the request of any party hereto, any electronic, facsimile
or telecopy copy of this Change in Terms Agreement shall  be
 re-executed in original form. No party hereto may raise the use of electronic mail, a facsimile machine or telecopier or
the fact that any signature was transmitted through the use of electronic mail or a facsimile or telecopier as a defense to the
enforcement of this Change in Terms Agreement. 

CHANGE IN TERMS AGREEMENT  

PRIOR TO SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, EACH BORROWER READ AND UNDERSTOOD
