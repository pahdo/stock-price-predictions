NOTE REGARDING REVERSE STOCK SPLIT  

On September 13, 2016, we filed a Certificate of Change pursuant
to NRS 78.209 with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada to effect a reverse split of our common stock at a ratio of one
for twelve, effective on September 16, 2016. All historical share and per share amounts reflected in this report have been adjusted
to reflect the reverse stock split.

  September

 (Unaudited) 

Note 1:  
      Nature of Operations   

TapImmune Inc. (the  Company ),
a Nevada corporation incorporated in 1992, is a biotechnology company focusing on immunotherapy specializing in the development
of innovative peptide and gene-based immunotherapeutics and vaccines for the treatment of oncology and infectious disease. Unlike
other vaccine technologies that narrowly address the initiation of an immune response, TapImmune's approach broadly stimulates
the cellular immune system by enhancing the function of killer T-cells and T-helper cells and by restoring antigen presentation
in tumor cells allowing their recognition and killing by the immune system. 

NOTE 2:   
      Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8
of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and on the same basis as the Company prepares its
annual audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation
of such interim results. 

The results for the statement of operations
are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016 or for any future interim period.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited financial statements; however, it does
not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed
consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December
31, 2015, and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K. 

NOTE 3:   
      LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION   

The Company s activities since inception
have consisted principally of acquiring product and technology rights, raising capital, and performing research and development.
Successful completion of the Company s development programs and, ultimately, the attainment of profitable operations are
dependent on future events, including, among other things, its ability to access potential markets; secure financing, develop a
customer base; attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel; and develop strategic alliances. From inception, the Company has
been funded by a combination of equity and debt financings. 

The Company expects to continue to incur
substantial losses over the next several years during its development phase. To fully execute its business plan, the Company will
need to complete certain research and development activities and clinical studies. Further, the Company s product candidates
will require regulatory approval prior to commercialization. These activities may span many years and require substantial expenditures
to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful. Any delays in completing these activities could adversely impact the Company. The
Company plans to meet its capital requirements primarily through issuances of debt and equity securities and, in the longer term,
revenue from product sales. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
cash and cash equivalents of approximately $9,587,000. Historically, the Company had net losses and negative cash flows from operations.
Management intends to continue its research efforts and to finance operations of the Company through debt and/or equity financings.
Management plans to seek additional debt and/or equity financing through private or public offerings or through a business combination
or strategic partnership. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in obtaining additional financing on favorable
terms, or at all. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

Note 4:  
      SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

There have been no material changes in
the Company s significant accounting policies to those previously disclosed in the Company s annual report on Form
10-K, which was filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016 other than the one disclosed below relating to grant income: 

Grant Income  

The Company recognizes grant income in
accordance with the terms stipulated under the grant awarded to the Company s collaborators at the Mayo Foundation from the
U. S. Department of Defense. In various situations, the Company receives certain payments from the U.S. Department of Defense for
reimbursement of clinical supplies. These payments are non-refundable, and are not dependent on the Company s ongoing future
performance. The Company has adopted a policy of recognizing these payments as grant income when received. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncement  

Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ),
No. 2016-09 - In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock
Compensation. The areas for simplification in this update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement
of cash flows. Some of the specific changes associated with the update include all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including
tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) being recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.
The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur.
An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period.
An entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest
(current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 

The Company has evaluated the impact of
ASU No. 2016-09 and has determined that the adoption of the impact of forfeitures, net of income taxes, will not have a material
impact on the Company s future financial statements. 

Note 5:  
      net income (loss) per share   

Basic income (loss) per common share is
computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted
income per common share is computed similar to basic income per common share except that it reflects the potential dilution that
could occur if dilutive securities or other obligations to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. 

Income (loss) per-share amounts for all
periods have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Company s 1-for-12 reverse stock split, which was effective September
16, 2016. 

The following table sets forth the computation
of income (loss) per share: 

The following securities, rounded to the thousand, were not
included in the diluted net loss per share calculation because their effect was anti-dilutive for the periods presented: 

Note 6:  
      DERIVATIVE LIABILITY - WARRANTs    

A summary of quantitative information with
respect to valuation methodology and significant unobservable inputs used for the Company s common stock purchase warrants
that are categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the nine months ended 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

The foregoing assumptions are reviewed
quarterly and are subject to change based primarily on management s assessment of the probability of the events described
occurring. Accordingly, changes to these assessments could materially affect the valuations. 

Financial Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value
on a Recurring Basis   

The fair value accounting standards define
fair value as the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants. As such, fair value is determined based upon assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an
asset or liability. Fair value measurements are rated on a three-tier hierarchy as follows: 

Level 1 inputs: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets;   

Level 2 inputs: Inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable either
directly or indirectly; and   

Level 3 inputs: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require
the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.   

Financial assets and liabilities measured
at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below and disclosed on the balance sheet under Derivative liability   warrants: 

There were no transfers between Level 1,
2 or 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The following table presents changes in
Level 3 liabilities measured at fair value for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Warrant Amendment Transaction   

On August 10, 2016, the Company and holders
of an aggregate of 3,096,665 outstanding Series A Warrants, Series A-1 Warrants, Series C Warrants, Series C-1 Warrants, Series
D Warrants, Series D-1 Warrants, Series E Warrants and Series E-1 Warrants entered into warrant amendment agreements (the  Amended
Warrants ) in which they agreed to amend the terms of the outstanding series warrants to remove provisions that had previously
precluded equity classification treatment on the Company s balance sheets. 

In consideration for such amendment and
the exercise of the Series C Warrants and Series C-1 Warrants, the Company issued an aggregate of 750,000 additional shares of
common stock to such warrant holders and new five-year warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Company common stock at an exercise
price of $7.20 per share. The value of the shares and fair value of the warrants was treated as dividend on the statement of stockholders 
equity of $4.5 million. 

The fair value of the Amended Warrants
was re-measured immediately prior to the date of amendment with changes in fair value recorded as a gain of $556,000 in the statement
of operations and $15.5 million was reclassified to equity. 

Note
    7:  
      STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   

The following table summarizes the components
of stock-based compensation expense in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

Stock Options    

A summary of the Company s stock option activity is as
follows: 

Total stock-based compensation cost related
to unvested awards not yet recognized and the weighted average periods over which the awards are expected to be recognized as of
September 30, 2016 are as follows: 

Unrecognized stock-based compensation cost:    
     $  1,081,000     
 
     Expected weighted average period compensation costs to be recognized (years):    
        1.75     

Note
    8:  
      Promissory note    

At September 30, 2016, the Company had
an outstanding promissory note in the amount of $5,000 as compared to two outstanding promissory notes totaling $30,000 at December
31, 2015. The promissory note outstanding at September 30, 2016 bears 10% annual interest. 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company paid a $25,000 promissory note and $6,524 of accrued interest in final settlement. 

Note
    9:  
      Promissory note, related
    party   

At December 31, 2015, the Company had an
outstanding promissory note in the amount of $23,000 owed to an officer of the Company. The promissory note bore no interest charges
and had no fixed repayment terms. In September 2016, the note was paid in full. 

Reverse Stock Split 

Effective September 16, 2016, the Company
effected a one for twelve reverse stock-split of our issued and outstanding common stock and has retroactively adjusted our common
shares outstanding, options and warrants amounts outstanding. The Company has presented its share data for and as of all periods
presented on this basis. The par value was not adjusted as a result of the one for twelve reverse stock split. All prior period
share transactions included in the Company s stock transactions and balances have been retroactively restated. 

2016 Common Stock Transactions  

Private placements    

On August 10, 2016 and August 25, 2016,
the Company completed private placements of units with certain accredited investors. The units consisted of (i) one share of the
Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share and (ii) one five-year warrant to purchase one share of Company common
stock for $6.00. The Company issued and sold an aggregate of 653,166 units at a purchase price per unit of $4.80 for an aggregate
of approximately $3.1 million. The Company incurred approximately $0.8 million in agency fees and legal costs. 

In addition, the Company issued five-year
warrants to the placement agent in the offering providing for the purchase of up to 65,317 shares of Company common stock for $4.80
per share. 

Pursuant to the registration rights agreements
entered into in connection with the private placements, the Company is required to file a registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission registering for resale (a) the common stock issued in the private placement offering; (b) the shares of
common stock issuable upon the exercise of the five-year warrants; and (c) the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise
of the warrants issued to the placement agent. The Company is required to file the registration statement within 120 days of the
August 10, 2016 closing or by December 8, 2016. The Company is also required to ensure that the registration statement is declared
effective within 90 calendar days after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or by March 8, 2017. 

In accordance with the registration rights
agreements, should the Company fail to meet the above criteria, the Company is subject to pay the investors liquidated damages.
The liquidated damages shall be a cash sum payment calculated at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum of the aggregate purchase
price for the registrable securities or aggregate amount upon exercise of the placement agent warrants. 

In accordance with applicable U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, a contingent obligation to make future payments must be recorded if the transfer of consideration
under a registration payment arrangement is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has determined that should it
be required to pay liquidated damages to the investors of the private placements, the aggregate contingent liability it would be
required to record would be approximately $29,000 per month for each month it fails or is estimated to fail to meet the above criteria. 

At the August 10, 2016 and August 26,2016
private placement closings, and on September 30, 2016, the Company concluded that it is not probable that it will be required
to remit any payments to the investors for failing to obtain an effective registration statement or failing to maintain its effectiveness. 

Warrant Amendment Transaction   

On August 10, 2016, the Company and holders
of an aggregate of 3,096,665 outstanding Series A Warrants, Series A-1 Warrants, Series C Warrants, Series C-1 Warrants, Series
D Warrants, Series D-1 Warrants, Series E Warrants and Series E-1 Warrants entered into warrant amendment agreements (the  Amended
Warrants ) in which they agreed to amend the terms of the outstanding series warrants to remove provisions that had previously
precluded equity classification treatment on the Company s balance sheets. 

In consideration for such amendment and the exercise of the
Series C Warrants and Series C-1 Warrants, the Company issued an aggregate of 750,000 additional shares of common stock to such
warrant holders and new five-year warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares of Company common stock at an exercise price of $7.20 per
share. The value of the shares and fair value of the warrants was treated as dividend on the statement of stockholders  equity
of $4.5 million. 

Share Purchase Warrants    

A summary of the Company s share
purchase warrants as of September 30, 2016 and changes during the period is presented below: 

Consulting Arrangements   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company issued 60,000 common shares as part of consulting agreements. The fair value of the common stock of approximately
$414,000 was recognized as stock-based compensation in general and administrative expense. 

Debt Settlement   

In May 2016, the Company issued 10,191
common shares as part of debt conversion agreements from 2014. The fair value of the common stock of approximately $70,000 was
recognized as loss on debt settlement agreements in other income (expense). 

In September 2016, the Company paid $27,000
for a promissory note from 2008 and related $38,000 of accrued interest. The $65,000 payment was recognized as loss on debt settlement
agreements in other income (expense). 

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company received approximately $231,000 of grant awarded to Mayo Foundation from the U.S. Department of Defense for
the Phase II Clinical Trial of TPIV 200. The grant paid for the clinical supplies purchased by the Company. 

Employment Agreements   

In November 2015, the Company entered into
an employment agreement with Dr. Glynn Wilson, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, President and Chairman of the Company.
As part of the agreement, Dr. Wilson was awarded 19,018 fully vested common shares in March 2016. The fair value of the common
stock of approximately $146,000 was recognized as stock-based compensation in general and administrative expense. 

In July, 2016, the Company entered into
an employment agreement with Dr. John Bonfiglio relating to his appointment as the Company s President and Chief Operating

listing of the Company s common stock on a national securities exchange in the United States or (ii) the first anniversary
of the employment agreement, so long as Dr. Bonfiglio is employed with the Company. The fair value of the common stock of approximately
$103,000 was recognized as stock-based compensation in general and administrative expense. 

In August 2016, the Company appointed
Michael Loiacono as the Company s Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. In connection
with Mr. Loiacono s appointment he entered into an employment agreement with the Company. The employment agreement provides
that Mr. Loiacono s base salary will be $200,000 per year and he is eligible for an annual performance bonus of up to 50%
of his base salary. The term of the employment agreement is for two years and will be automatically extended for an additional
12 months unless terminated by Mr. Loiacono or the Company.

Company Overview 

Our Cancer Vaccines   

We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology
company specializing in the development of innovative peptide and gene-based immunotherapeutics and vaccines for the treatment
of cancer   metastatic disease. We are also developing a proprietary technology to improve the ability of the cellular immune
system to recognize and destroy diseased cells. This DNA expression technology named Polystart is in preclinical development. 

To enhance shareholder value and taking
into account development timelines, we plan to focus on advancing our clinical programs including our Folate Receptor Alpha program
for breast and ovarian cancer and our HER2/neu peptide antigen program into Phase II clinical trials. In parallel, we plan to complete
the preclinical development of our Polystart technology as an integral component of our prime-and-boost vaccine methodology. 

The Immunotherapy Industry for Cancer  

Immuno-oncology has become the most rapidly
growing sector in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry. The approval and success of checkpoint inhibitors Yervoy and Opdivo
(Bristol Myers Squibb) and Keytruda (Merck   Co.) together with the development of CAR T-cell therapies (Juno Therapeutics,
Kite Pharma) has provided much momentum in this sector. In addition, new evidence points to the increasing use of combination immunotherapies
for the treatment of cancer. This has provided greater opportunities for the successful development of T-cell vaccines in combination
with other approaches. 

Products and Technology in Development-Clinical  

Phase I Human
Clinical Trials    Folate Alpha Breast and Ovarian Cancer   Mayo Clinic  

Folate Receptor Alpha is expressed in over
80% of triple negative breast cancers and in addition, over 90% of ovarian cancers, for which the only treatment options are surgery,
radiation and chemotherapy, leaving a very important and urgent clinical need for a new therapeutic. Time to recurrence is relatively
short for these types of cancer and survival prognosis is extremely poor after recurrence. In the United States alone, there are
approximately 30,000 ovarian cancer patients and 40,000 triple negative breast cancer patients newly diagnosed every year. 

TPIV 200 Folate Receptor Alpha  

A 24 patient Phase I clinical trial has
been completed. The vaccine is well tolerated and safe and 20 out of 21 evaluable patients showed positive immune responses providing
a strong rationale rational for progressing to phase II trials. GMP manufacturing for Phase II trials is progressing well towards
a commercial formulation and final analyses of clinical plans are near completion. On July 27, 2015, 
 TapImmune exercised its option agreement with Mayo Clinic with the signing of a worldwide exclusive license agreement to
commercialize a proprietary folate receptor alpha vaccine technology for all cancer indications. As part of this Agreement, the
IND for the folate receptor alpha Phase I trial was transferred from Mayo to TapImmune for amendment for the Company s Phase
II Clinical Trials     on our lead product. 

On September 15, 2015, we announced that
our collaborators at the Mayo Clinic had been awarded a grant of $13.3 million from the U.S. Department of Defense. This grant,
commencing September 15, 2015, will cover the costs for a 280 patient Phase II Clinical Trial of Folate Receptor Alpha Vaccine
in patients with Triple Negative Breast Cancer. 
 TapImmune will work closely with Mayo Clinic on this clinical trial by providing clinical and manufacturing expertise as
well as providing GMP vaccine formulations. These vaccine formulations are being developed for multiple Phase II clinical programs
in triple negative breast and ovarian cancer in combination with other immunotherapeutics. 

On December 9, 2015, we announced that
we received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food   Drug Administration s Office of Orphan Products Development
(OOPD) for our cancer vaccine TPIV 200 in the treatment of ovarian cancer. The TPIV 200 ovarian cancer clinical program will now
receive benefits including tax credits on clinical research and 7-year market exclusivity upon receiving marketing approval. TPIV
200 is a multi-epitope peptide vaccine that targets Folate Receptor Alpha which is overexpressed in multiple cancers. 

On February 3, 2016 we announced that the
U.S. Food   Drug Administration (FDA) has designated the investigation of multiple-epitope Folate Receptor Alpha Peptide Vaccine
(TPIV 200) with GM-CSF adjuvant for maintenance therapy in subjects with platinum-sensitive advanced ovarian cancer who achieved
stable disease or partial response following completion of standard of care chemotherapy, as a Fast Track Development Program.
A Phase 2 study in this indication is being readied for initiation by the end of 2016. 

We are currently enrolling a Company sponsored
triple negative breast cancer study at 8 clinical sites nation-wide. The study will enroll 80 patients. It is open-label and designed
to look at dosing regimens, immune responses and efficacy. 

The Company also announced the start of
an ovarian cancer study sponsored by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City in collaboration with Astra Zeneca
Pharmaceuticals. This study is currently enrolling platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients and is designed to look at the effects
of combination therapy with Astra Zeneca s checkpoint inhibitor durvalamab. The study will enroll 40 patients and is open
label. Although we have no business relationship with Astra Zeneca, we are paying for half of the clinical study plus providing
our TPIV 200 for the study. 

Phase I Human
Clinical Trials   HER2/neu+ Breast Cancer   Mayo Clinic   

Patient dosing has been completed. Final
safety analysis on all the patients treated is complete and shown to be safe. In addition, 19 out of 20 evaluable patients showed
robust T-cell immune responses to the antigens in the vaccine composition providing a solid case for advancement to Phase II in
2015. An additional secondary endpoint incorporated into this Phase I Trial will be a two year follow on recording time to disease
recurrence in the participating breast cancer patients. 

For Phase I(b)/II studies, we plan to add
a Class I peptide, licensed from the Mayo Clinic (April 16, 2012), to the four Class II peptides. Management believes that the
combination of Class I and Class II HER2/neu antigens, gives us the leading HER2/neu vaccine platform. As the folate receptor alpha
vaccine is our lead product our plans are now initiating formulation studies to progress the HER2/neu vaccine towards a Phase II
Clinical Trial in 2017. 

Products and Technology-Preclinical

Polystart   

We converted the previously filed U.S.
Provisional Patent Application on Polystart into a full Patent Application, and in February 2016 we received a Notice of Allowance
from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for a patent application entitled,  A chimeric nucleic acid molecule with
non-AUG initiation sequences.  The term of this patent extends to March 17, 2034. Additional patent filings are in progress.
We plan to develop PolyStart as both a stand-alone therapy and as a  boost strategy  to be used synergistically with
our peptide-based vaccines for breast and ovarian cancer. 

Current
State of the Company   

We are a clinical-stage
immunotherapy company specializing in the development of innovative peptide and gene-based immunotherapeutics and vaccines for
the treatment of cancer. We now plan to conduct multiple Phase II clinical trials on our vaccines. The largest of these studies
in triple-negative breast cancer is totally funded by a $13.3 million grant from the U.S. Department of Defense to our collaborators
at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. A Company-sponsored trial in triple negative breast cancer started during the second
quarter of 2016 with recruitment at multiple sites and treatment of first patients. We believe that our development pipeline is
strong and provides us the opportunity to continue to expand on collaborations with leading institutions and corporations. 

We believe, the
strength of our science and development approaches is becoming more widely appreciated, particularly as our clinical program has
now generated positive interim data on both clinical programs in Breast and Ovarian Cancer. 

We continue to
be focused on our entry into Phase II Triple Negative Cancer Trials including application for Fast Track   Orphan Drug Status
as well as planning for Phase II HER2/neu Breast Cancer Trials. 

We expect to continue
to prosecute our PolyStart patent filings and develop new constructs to facilitate collaborative efforts in our current clinical
indications and those where others have already indicated interest in combination therapies. 

We believe that
these fundamental programs and corporate activities have positioned TapImmune to capitalize on the acceptance of immunotherapy
as a leading therapeutic strategy in cancer and infectious disease. 

TapImmune s
Pipeline   

Clinical
Program   

We have a pipeline
of potential immunotherapies under development. Phase I clinical programs on HER2/neu for breast and ovarian cancer have been completed
and strong immune responses in over 90% of patients treated has provided the rationale and catalyst to advance these programs to
Phase II clinical trials. 

In addition to
the exciting clinical developments, our peptide vaccine technology may be coupled with our recently developed in-house Polystart
nucleic acid-based technology designed to make vaccines significantly more effective by producing four times the required peptides
for the immune systems to recognize and act on. Our nucleic acid-based systems can also incorporate  TAP  which stands
for Transporter associated with Antigen Presentation. 

A key component
to success is having a comprehensive patent strategy that continually updates and extends patent coverage for key products. It
is highly unlikely that early patents will extend through ultimate product marketing, so extending patent life is an important
strategy for ensuring product protection. 

We have three
active patent families that we are supporting: 

1. Filed patents
on PolyStart expression vector (owned by TapImmune and filed in 2014: this IP covers the use with TAP). The Company announced the
allowance of this patent in February 2016. 

2. Filed patents
on HER2/neu Class II and Class I antigens: exclusive license from Mayo Foundation; and 

3. Filed patents
on Folate Receptor Alpha antigens: exclusive license from Mayo Foundation 

While the pathway
to successful product development takes time, we believe we have put in place significant for success. The strength of our product
pipeline and access to leading scientists and institutions gives us a unique opportunity to make a major contribution to global
health care. 

With respect to
the broader market, a major driver and positive influence on our activities has been the emergence and general acceptance of the
potential of a new generation of immunotherapies that promise to change the standard of care for cancer. The immunotherapy sector
has been greatly stimulated by the approval of Provenge  for prostate cancer and Yervoy  for metastatic melanoma, progression
of the areas of checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive T-cell therapy and multiple approaches reaching Phase II and Phase III status. 

We believe that through our combination
of technologies, we are well positioned to be a leading player in this emerging market. It is important to note that many of the
late stage immunotherapies currently in development do not represent competition to our programs, but instead offer synergistic
opportunities to partner our antigen based immunotherapeutics, and Polystart expression system. Thus, the use of naturally processed
T-cell antigens discovered using samples derived from cancer patients plus our Polystart expression technology to improve antigen
presentation to T-cells could not only produce an effective cancer vaccine in its own right but also to enhance the efficacy of
other immunotherapy approaches such as CAR-T and PD1 inhibitors for example. 

Recent Developments and Company Highlights  

Research Programs    

Her2neu
License Agreement      

On June 7, 2016
we announced that we exercised our option agreement with Mayo Clinic and signed a worldwide license agreement to a proprietary
HER2neu vaccine technology. The license gives us the right to develop and commercialize the technology in any cancer indication
in which the Her2neu antigen is overexpressed. 

Phase II
Trials Started   

On April 26, 2016
we announced plans to participate in a Phase 2 trial of our cancer vaccine, TPIV 200, a multi-epitope anti-folate receptor vaccine
(FR ), in combination with durvalumab (MEDI4736), an anti-PD-L1 antibody, in patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.
The study started with the enrollment and treatment of patients in the second quarter of 2016 at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer
Center in New York and is being led by Jason Konner, M.D. as Principal Investigator. On June 21, 2016, we announced the treatment
of the first patient in a company-sponsored Phase II trial in triple negative breast cancer as part of a multi-center study. 

Manufacturing   

On April 7, 2016,
we announced that we have successfully completed formulation development, scale-up, GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) manufacturing,
and the release of TPIV 200, our multi-epitope folate receptor peptide vaccine for breast and ovarian cancer. The manufactured
product contains five peptide antigens freeze dried in a single vial, ready for injection after reconstitution and addition of
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). TPIV 200 doses are now available for the upcoming Phase II clinical
trials in both triple negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer. 

Recent Developments    

Enrolling Patients: Phase 2 TPIV
200 Trial in Triple Negative Breast Cancer   

We have opened 8 clinical sites and begun
treating patients in a Phase 2 trial of our Folate Receptor Alpha cancer vaccine, TPIV 200, in the treatment of triple negative
breast cancer, one of the most difficult to treat cancers representing a clear unmet medical need. The open-label, 80 patient clinical
trial is designed to evaluate dosing regimens, adjuvants, efficacy, and immune responses in women with triple negative breast cancer.
Key data from the trial is expected to be included in a future New Drug Application submission to the FDA for marketing clearance.
This trial is sponsored and conducted by TapImmune. 

Enrolling Patients: Phase 2 Trial
at Memorial Sloan Kettering of TPIV 200 in Ovarian Cancer   

A Phase 2 study of TPIV 200 in ovarian
cancer patients who are not responsive to platinum, a commonly used chemotherapy for ovarian cancer, sponsored by Memorial Sloan
Kettering Cancer Center, and in collaboration with AstraZeneca and TapImmune, has begun enrollment for a 40 patient study. The
open-label study is designed to evaluate a combination therapy which includes our TPIV 200 T-cell vaccine and AstraZeneca s
checkpoint inhibitor, durvalumab. Because they are unresponsive to platinum, these patients have no real options left. If the combination
therapy proves effective, we believe it would address a critical unmet need. TPIV 200 has received Orphan Drug designation for
use in the treatment of ovarian cancer. 

Enrollment to Commence in Q4 2016:
Phase 2 Mayo Clinic-U.S. DOD Trial of TPIV 200 in Triple Negative Breast Cancer     We anticipate this Phase 2 study
of TPIV 200 in the treatment of triple negative breast cancer, conducted by the Mayo Clinic and sponsored by the U.S. Department
of Defense (DOD), will begin to enroll patients in the fourth quarter of this year. The anticipated 280 patient study will be led
by Dr. Keith Knutson of the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida. Dr. Knutson is the inventor of the technology and an advisor
to TapImmune. While TapImmune is supplying doses of TPIV 200 for the trial, the remaining costs associated with conducting this
study will be funded by a $13.3 million grant made by the DOD to the Mayo Clinic. 

Clinical Sites to Open in Q4 2016:
Phase 2 TPIV 200 Trial in Platinum-Sensitive Ovarian Cancer   

By the end of 2016, we expect to have at
least one clinical site open in a Phase 2 trial of TPIV 200 in 80 ovarian cancer patients who are responsive to platinum. We have
received the FDA s Fast Track designation to develop TPIV 200 as a maintenance therapy in combination with platinum, in platinum
responsive ovarian cancer. This multi-center, double-blind efficacy study is sponsored and conducted by TapImmune. 

Open IND with FDA for TPIV 110 in
Q4 2016 or in Q1 2017: Phase 2 Protocol Now in Preparation      

We have reformulated our second cancer
vaccine product, TPIV 110, following very strong safety and immune responses from a Phase 1 Mayo Clinic study. TPIV 110 targets
Her2/neu, which makes it applicable to breast, ovarian and colorectal cancer. The reformulated product adds a fifth antigen which
should produce an even more robust immune response activating both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells. We have requested a pre-Investigational
New Drug (IND) meeting with the FDA and submitted questions to the FDA related to opening the IND. A response from the FDA is expected
in September and we anticipate having an open IND by year-end pending comments from FDA. The protocol for a Phase 2 trial of TPIV
110 in the treatment of Her2/neu positive breast cancer patients has been designed and is now being reviewed by our Scientific
Advisory Board and collaborators. 

TPIV Products are Off-the-Shelf,
Commercially Viable, with Excellent Potential Margins   

We are continuously working on improving
our product formulation and supply. We believe TPIV 200 and TPIV 110 are both very stable, off-the-shelf, lyophilized products
that only require reconstitution at the clinical site before injection. We believe the investments we have made in the formulation
work we have performed will result in a commercially viable product with excellent potential profit margins. 

Robust Product Data   Independent
Vetting Key to High-Value Collaborations      

We believe the Phase 1 data produced for
both TPIV 200 and TPIV 100 in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic are the driving force behind the high-value collaborations we
have been able to maintain and establish with organizations including Mayo Clinic, AstraZeneca, Sloan Kettering, and the U.S. Department
of Defense. As we move forward into advancing the Phase 2 studies, some of which are represent collaboration with prestigious third
party organizations, we believe this represents further independent vetting of potential of our technology. 

Company Highlights  

Reverse Stock Split   

On September 16, 2016, at the opening
of trading, we effected a one-for-twelve reverse split of our common shares. The common shares began trading on a split-adjusted
basis on September 16, 2016. The reverse stock split was effected in connection with the Company s intent to apply to list
the common stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market. On November 2, 2016, we received notification that we were approved for listing
on The Nasdaq Capital Market. Our common stock is expected to begin trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market at the opening of trading
on Tuesday, November 8, 2016 under the ticker symbol, TPIV. 

Our historical financial results have been
adjusted to reflect a reduction in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock from 62,890,763 shares to 5,240,897 shares
at September 30, 2015 and from 70,550,763 shares to 5,879,230 shares at December 31, 2015. In addition, effective upon the reverse
stock split, the number of authorized shares of our common stock was reduced from 500 million shares to 41,666,667 shares. All
fractional shares resulting from the reverse stock split were rounded up to the nearest whole share. All share data herein has
been retroactively adjusted for the reverse stock split. The par value was not adjusted as a result of the one for twelve reverse
stock split. 

August 2016
Private Placement Transaction   

On August 10, 2016 and August 25, 2016,
the Company completed private placements of units with certain accredited investors. The units consisted of (i) one share of the
Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share and (ii) one five-year warrant to purchase one share of Company common
stock for $6.00. The Company issued and sold an aggregate of 653,166 units at a purchase price per unit of $4.80 for an aggregate
of approximately $3.1 million. The Company incurred approximately $0.8 million in agency fees and legal costs. 

In addition, the Company issued five-year
warrants to the placement agent in the offering providing for the purchase of up to 65,317 shares of Company common stock for $4.80
per share. 

Pursuant to the registration rights agreements
entered into in connection with the private placements, the Company is required to file a registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission registering for resale (a) the common stock issued in the private placement offering; (b) the shares of
common stock issuable upon the exercise of the five-year warrants; and (c) the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise
of the warrants issued to the placement agent. The Company is required to file the registration statement within 120 days of the
August 10, 2016 closing or by December 8, 2016. The Company is also required to ensure that the registration statement is declared
effective within 90 calendar days after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or by March 8, 2017. 

In accordance with the registration rights
agreements, should the Company fail to meet the above criteria, the Company is subject to pay the investors liquidated damages.
The liquidated damages shall be a cash sum payment calculated at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum of the aggregate purchase
price for the registrable securities or aggregate amount upon exercise of the placement agent warrants. 

In accordance with applicable U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, a contingent obligation to make future payments must be recorded if the transfer of consideration
under a registration payment arrangement is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has determined that should it
be required to pay liquidated damages to the investors of the private placements, the aggregate contingent liability it would be
required to record would be approximately $29,000 per month for each month it fails or is estimated to fail to meet the above criteria. 

At the August 10, 2016 and August 26,2016
private placement closings, and on September 30, 2016, the Company concluded that it is not probable that it will be required to
remit any payments to the investors for failing to obtain an effective registration statement or failing to maintain its effectiveness. 

August 2016 Warrant Exercises   

On August 11, 2016, holders of an aggregate
of 583,333 outstanding Series C Warrants and 416,667 Series C-1 Warrants, each providing for the purchase of one share of our common
stock for $6.00 per share, exercised their warrants for an aggregate exercise price of $6,000,000.  

August 2016 Warrant Amendments   

Simultaneous with the exercise of the warrants,
we and holders of an aggregate of 3,096,665 outstanding Series A Warrants, Series A-1 Warrants, Series C Warrants, Series C-1 Warrants,
Series D Warrants, Series D-1 Warrants, Series E Warrants and Series E-1 Warrants (the  Outstanding Series Warrants )
entered into Warrant Amendment Agreements (the  Amendment Agreement ), in which they agreed to amend the terms of the
Outstanding Series Warrants to remove provisions from the Outstanding Series Warrants that had previously caused them to be classified
as a derivative liability as opposed to equity on our balance sheet. In consideration for such amendment and the exercise
of the Series C Warrants and Series C-1 Warrants, we issued an aggregate of 750,000 additional shares of common stock to such warrant
holders and new five-year warrants to purchase 1 million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $7.20 per share (the
 Series F and F-1Warrants ). 

The following table reflects the status
of the outstanding warrants from the January 2015, March 2015, and August 2016 private placement financings (including placement
agent warrants) following the Amendment Agreement and private placement: 

Addition
of Executive Officers   

On July 18,
2016 we announced that Dr. John Bonfiglio, a consultant and a member of our Board of Directors, was appointed as our President
and Chief Operating Officer and entered into an employment agreement with us. Concurrent with such appointment we amended the employment
agreement of Dr. Wilson for Dr. Wilson to relinquish the office of President. 

On August 25,
2016 we announced that Michael J. Loiacono, a consultant, was appointed as our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Accounting Officer,
Secretary and Treasurer and entered into an employment agreement with us. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

The condensed consolidated financial statements
are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported
amounts of expenses in the periods presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances
are reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates,
requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. The critical accounting estimates that affect the consolidated financial
statements and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those described under Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Results of Operations  

In this discussion
of the Company s results of operations and financial condition, amounts, other than per-share amounts, have been rounded
to the nearest thousand dollars. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015  

We recorded a net loss of $2,103,000 or
($0.29) basic and diluted per share during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net income of $28,503,000 or
$7.04 basic and $4.23 diluted per share during the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating costs increased to $2,722,000
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,738,000 in the prior period. Significant changes in operating expenses
are outlined as follows: 

Research and development costs during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,109,000
compared to $969,000 during the prior period. The increase was primarily due to the Company expensing the Mayo Foundation license
fee payments in the current period and higher expenses relating to research.   

General and administrative expenses increased to $1,612,000 during the three months ended September
30, 2016 from $769,000 during the prior period. This was due to generally increased expenses relating to consulting, general and
administrative and professional fees during the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to increased activity in operations.   

The changes in fair value of derivative liabilities for the three months ended September 30, 2016
was $684,000 as compared to $30,266,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The variance is due to the revaluation of
the Series A and A-1, Series C and C-1, Series D and D-1 and Series E and E-1 warrants issued by us in January and March 2015.
We revalue the derivative liabilities at each balance sheet date to fair value. The fair value is determined using Black-Scholes
valuation model using various assumptions. The most significant changes in the assumptions was the difference in the strike price
used at September 30, 2016 of $6.69 compared to $7.40 at September 30, 2015, the exercise of warrants with derivative liabilities
and the August 2016 amendments to certain of the warrants to remove the clause that caused the warrants to be classified as derivative
liabilities. Due to these significant changes, the fair value of the derivative liabilities decreased by $684,000 with a corresponding
gain in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.   

During the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 the Company incurred $65,000 loss on debt
settlement agreements relating to an outstanding agreement from a previous year. This compares to $25,000 loss on debt settlement
agreements for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine
months ended September 30, 2015  

We recorded a net loss of $879,000 or ($0.14)
basic and ($0.54) diluted per share during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a net loss of $32,414,000 or ($10.61)
basic and diluted per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Operating costs increased to $6,901,000
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,904,000 in the prior period. Significant changes in operating expenses
are outlined as follows: 

Research and development costs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $3,343,000
compared to $2,324,000 during the prior period. This was due to the Company exercising its option to acquire Mayo Clinic technology
as part of an agreement entered into in March 2014 and increased in-house research activity in the current period.   

General and administrative expenses increased to $3,558,000 during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 from $1,580,000 during the prior period. This was due to generally increased expenses relating to consulting, general
and administrative and professional fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as the Company s operating activities
increased substantially.   

The changes in fair value of derivative liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was $5,925,000 as compared to ($28,486,000) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The variance in the current period is
due to the revaluation of the Series A and A-1, Series C and C-1, Series D and D-1 and Series E and E-1 warrants issued by us in
January and March 2015. We revalue the derivative liabilities at each balance sheet date to fair value. The most significant changes
in the assumptions was the difference in the strike price used at September 30, 2016 of $6.69 compared to $7.40 at September 30,
2015, the exercise of warrants with derivative liabilities and the August 2016 amendments to certain of the warrants to remove
the clause that caused the warrants to be classified as derivative liabilities. Due to these significant changes, the fair value
of the derivative liabilities decreased by $5,925,000 with a corresponding gain in the condensed consolidated statement of operations.   

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $231,000 of a grant awarded
to Mayo Foundation from the U.S. Department of Defense for the Phase II Clinical Trial of TPIV 200. The grant paid for the clinical
supplies purchased by the Company.   

During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 the Company incurred $135,000 loss on debt settlement agreements relating
to an outstanding debt agreement from previous years. This compares to $25,000 loss on debt settlement agreements for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

We have not generated any revenues since
inception, we have financed our operations primarily through public and private offerings of our stock and debt including warrants
and the exercise thereof. The following table sets forth our cash and working capital as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015: 

Cash Flows    

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Net Cash
Used in Operating Activities   

Net cash used in operating activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4,756,000 compared to $3,492,000 during the prior period. We had no revenues during
the current or prior periods. Operating expenditures, excluding non-cash interest and stock-based charges during the current period
primarily consisted of consulting and management fees, office and general expenditures, and professional fees. 

Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities   

Net cash provided by financing activities
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,766,000 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $9,438,000
during the prior period. The financing consisted of proceeds from private placements and warrant exercises in the current period
as was in the prior period. 

Financings  

Our current available
funding has come from financings that we conducted in January and March of 2015 and from the exercise of warrants issued in connection
with our January and March, 2015 financings as well as our recent August 2016 private placement. 

January
2015 Financing    

In January, 2015,
we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain investors for the sale of 610,000 units at a purchase price of $2.40
per unit, for a total purchase price of approximately $1,250,000, net of finders  fee and offering expenses of approximately
$214,000. Each unit consisting of (i) one share of the Company s Common Stock, (ii) one Series A warrant to purchase one
share of common stock, (iii) one Series B warrant to purchase one share of common stock (iv) one Series C warrant to purchase one
share of common stock, (v) one Series D warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and (vi) one Series E warrant to purchase
one share of common stock (the Series A, B, C, D and E warrants are hereby collectively referred to as the  January 2015
Warrants ). Series A warrants were exercisable at $18.00 per share, with a five-year term. Series B warrants were exercisable
at $4.80 per share, with a six-month term. Series C warrants were exercisable at $12.00 per share, with a five-year term. Series
D warrants were exercisable at $9.00 per share only if and to the extent that the Series B warrants are exercised, with a five-year
term from the date that the Series B warrants are exercised. Series E warrants were exercisable at $15.00 per share, only if and
to the extent that the Series C warrants are exercised, with a five-year term from the date that the Series C warrants are exercised.
Pursuant to a placement agent agreement, we agreed to issue warrants to purchase 30,500 common shares with substantially the same
terms as the January 2015 Warrants.   

March 2015
Financing   

In March, 2015,
we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain accredited investors for the sale of 416,667 units at a purchase price
of $2.40 per unit, for a total purchase price of approximately $950,000, net of finders  fee and offering expenses of approximately
$50,000. Each unit consisting of (i) one share of the Company s Common Stock, (ii) one Series A-1 warrant to purchase one
share of common stock, (iii) one Series B-1 warrant to purchase one share of common stock (iv) one Series C-1 warrant to purchase
one share of common stock, (v) one Series D-1 warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and (vi) one Series E-1 warrant to
purchase one share of common stock (the Series A-1, B-1, C-1, D-1 and E-1 warrants are hereby collectively referred to as
the  March 2015 Warrants ). The March 2015 Warrants have substantially the same terms as the January 2015 Warrants.
 Pursuant to a placement agent agreement, we agreed to issue warrants to purchase 10,417 common shares with substantially
the same terms as the March 2015 Warrants.    

Restructuring
of January and March 2015 Financings   

In May 2015, we
entered into a restructuring agreement with the investors of the January 2015 and March 2015 financings, where: 

The exercise price of the Series A and Series A-1 warrants was changed from $18.00 per share to
$1.20 per share,   

The exercise price of Series B and Series B-1 warrants was changed from $4.80 per share to $2.40
per share,   

Each warrant of Series B and Series B-1 existing prior to the restructuring agreement was replaced
with two warrants of such series,   

The exercise price of the Series C and Series C-1 warrants was changed from $12.00 per share to
$6.00 per share, and   

Each warrant of Series C and Series C-1 existing prior to the restructuring agreement was replaced
with two warrants of such series.   

As a result of
the restructuring agreement, we issued an additional 1,026,667 Series B and B-1 warrants and 1,026,667 Series C and C-1 Warrants. 

2016 Financing   

August 2016
Private Placement Transaction   

On August 10, 2016 and August 25, 2016,
the Company completed private placements of units with certain accredited investors. The units consisted of (i) one share of the
Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share and (ii) one five-year warrant to purchase one share of Company common
stock for $6.00. The Company issued and sold an aggregate of 653,166 units at a purchase price per unit of $4.80 for an aggregate
of approximately $3.1 million. The Company incurred approximately $0.8 million in agency fees and legal costs. 

In addition, the Company issued five-year
warrants to the placement agent in the offering providing for the purchase of up to 65,317 shares of Company common stock for $4.80
per share. 

Pursuant to the registration rights agreements
entered into in connection with the private placements, the Company is required to file a registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission registering for resale (a) the common stock issued in the private placement offering; (b) the shares of
common stock issuable upon the exercise of the five-year warrants; and (c) the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise
of the warrants issued to the placement agent. The Company is required to file the registration statement within 120 days of the
August 10, 2016 closing or by December 8, 2016. The Company is also required to ensure that the registration statement is declared
effective within 90 calendar days after filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or by March 8, 2017. 

In accordance with the registration rights
agreements, should the Company fail to meet the above criteria, the Company is subject to pay the investors liquidated damages.
The liquidated damages shall be a cash sum payment calculated at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum of the aggregate purchase
price for the registrable securities or aggregate amount upon exercise of the placement agent warrants. 

In accordance with applicable U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, a contingent obligation to make future payments must be recorded if the transfer of consideration
under a registration payment arrangement is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The Company has determined that should it
be required to pay liquidated damages to the investors of the private placements, the aggregate contingent liability it would be
required to record would be approximately $29,000 per month for each month it fails or is estimated to fail to meet the above criteria. 

At the August 10, 2016 and August 26,2016
private placement closings, and on September 30, 2016, the Company concluded that it is not probable that it will be required to
remit any payments to the investors for failing to obtain an effective registration statement or failing to maintain its effectiveness. 

Warrant Exercises   

Between June 16,
2015 and December 9, 2015, 3,090,000 shares were issued upon exercise of certain warrants we issued in connection with our 2015
financings, providing $9.22 million in proceeds. In August 2016, holders of an aggregate of 583,333 outstanding Series C Warrants
and 416,667 Series C-1 Warrants, each providing for the purchase of one share of our common stock for $6.00 per share, exercised
their warrants for an aggregate exercise price of $6,000,000.  

Future Capital Requirements   

Our capital requirements through 2017 will
depend on numerous factors, including the success of our research and development, the resources we devote to develop and support
our technologies and our success in pursuing strategic licensing and funded product development relationships with external partners.
Subject to our ability to raise additional capital including through possible joint ventures and/or partnerships, we expect to
incur substantial expenditures to further develop our technologies including continued increases in costs related to research,
nonclinical testing and clinical studies, as well as costs associated with our capital raising efforts and being a public company.
We intend to spend approximately $7,500,000 over the next twelve months in carrying out our plan of operations. We will require
substantial funds to conduct research and development and nonclinical and Phase II clinical testing of our licensed, patented technologies
and to develop sublicensing relationships for the Phase II and III clinical testing. Our plans include seeking both equity and
debt financing, alliances or other partnership agreements with entities interested in our technologies, or other business transactions
that would generate sufficient resources to ensure continuation of our operations and research and development programs. 

We expect to continue to seek additional
funding for our operations. Any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. If we were
unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of, delay or eliminate some or all of our planned
clinical testing and research and development activities, which could harm our business. The sale of additional equity or debt
securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities
or preferred stock, these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would
restrict our operations. We also will require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts. 

Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties
associated with research, development and commercialization of our product candidates, we are unable to estimate the exact amounts
of our working capital requirements. Our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to: 

the number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue;   

the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our product candidates, and
conducting nonclinical and clinical trials including the research and development expenditures we expect to make in connection
with our license agreements with Mayo Foundation;   

the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates;   

our ability to maintain current research and development licensing agreements and to establish
new strategic partnerships, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements;   

our ability to achieve our milestones under our licensing arrangements and the payment obligations
we may have;   

the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent
claims, including litigation costs and the outcome of such litigation; and   

the timing, receipt and amount of sales of, or royalties on, our future products, if any.   

We have based our estimates on assumptions
that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate. Potential
sources of financing include strategic relationships, public or private sales of our shares or debt and other sources. We may seek
to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long-term capital requirements. We do not
have any committed sources of financing at this time, and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we
need it on terms that will be acceptable to us, or at all. If we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other
securities convertible into common stock, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we are not able
to obtain financing when needed, we may be unable to carry out our business plan. As a result, we may have to significantly limit
our operations and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed. 

Various conditions outside of our control
may detract from our ability to raise additional capital needed to execute our plan of operations, including overall market conditions
in the international and local economies. We recognize that the United States economy has suffered through a period of uncertainty
during which the capital markets have been impacted, and that there is no certainty that these levels will stabilize or reverse
despite the optics of an improving economy. Any of these factors could have a material impact upon our ability to raise financing
and, as a result, upon our short-term or long-term liquidity. 

Going Concern   

We have no sources of revenue to provide
incoming cash flows to sustain our future operations. As outlined above, our ability to pursue our planned business activities
is dependent upon our successful efforts to raise additional capital. 

While these factors raise substantial doubt
regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which implies that we will continue to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in the normal course of
business. Our financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts
and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have not entered into any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes of
financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material
to investors.

     Controls and Procedures  

(a)    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Our management, with the participation
of our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered

information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and  Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Based on such evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in recording,
processing, summarizing and reporting, on a timely basis, information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file
or submit under the Exchange Act.   

It should be noted that any system of controls is based in part
upon certain assumptions designed to obtain reasonable (and not absolute) assurance as to its effectiveness, and there can be no
assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals. 

(b)    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

There have been no changes in our internal
control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ATTACHMENT A 

AMENDMENT TO 

ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION 

OF 

EDUVERSE.COM 

Pursuant to the provisions of sections 78.385
and 78.390 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, the undersigned corporation adopts the following articles of amendment to Article V
of its Articles of Incorporation. 

The aggregate number of
shares which the corporation shall have authority to issue is 50,000,000 shares of common stock at par value of $0.001 per share
and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock at par value of $0.001 per share. 

Common Stock. There shall be no
cumulative voting, and all pre-emptive rights are denied. Each share of common stock shall entitle the holder thereof to one vote
at all meetings of the stockholders. Stockholders shall not be liable to the corporation or its creditors for any debts or obligation
of the corporation. 

Simultaneously with the effective
date of this amendment (the  Effective Date ), each share of the Company s Common Stock, $0.001 par value, issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date (the  Old Common Stock ) shall automatically and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof be reclassified as and changed, pursuant to a reverse stock split, into any fraction thereof,
into 1/50 of a share of the Company s outstanding Common Stock, $0.001 par value (the  New Common Stock ), depending
upon a determination by the Board that a Reverse Stock Split is in the best interests of the Company and the Shareholders, subject
to the treatment of fractional share interests as described below. Each holder of a certificate or certificates which immediately
prior to the Effective Date represented outstanding shares of Old Common Stock (the  Old Certificates  whether one
or more) shall be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Old Certificates to the Company s Transfer Agent for cancellation,
a certificate or certificates (the  New Certificates , whether one or more) representing the number of whole shares
of the New Common Stock into which and for which the shares of the Old Common Stock formerly represented by such Old Certificates
so surrendered, are reclassified under the terms hereof. 

From and after the Effective Date.
Old Certificates shall represent only the right to receive New Certificates pursuant to the provisions hereof. No certificates
or scrip representing fractional share interests in New Common Stock will be issued, and no such fractional share interest will
entitle the holder thereof to votes, or to any rights of a shareholder of the Company. Any fraction of a share of new Common Stock
to which the holder would otherwise be entitled will be adjusted upward to the amount whole share. If more than one Old Certificate
shall be surrendered at one time for the amount of the same Shareholder, the number of full shares of New Common Stock for which
New Certificates shall be issued shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate number of shares represented by the Old Certificates
so surrendered. In the event that the Company s Transfer Agent determines that a holder of Old Certificates has not rendered
all his certificates for exchange, the Transfer Agent shall carry forward any fractional share until all certificates of that holder
have been presented for exchange such that payment for fractional shares to any one person shall not exceed the value of one share.
If any New Certificate is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificates surrendered for exchange are issued,
the Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer. From and after the Effective
Date the amount of capital represented by the shares of the New Common Stock into which and for which the shares of the Old Common
Stock are reclassified under the terms hereof shall be the same as the amount of capital represented by the shares of Old Common
Stock so reclassified, until thereafter reduced or increased in accordance with applicable law. 

Preferred Stock. The board of
directors of the corporation is authorized to divide the preferred stock into as many series as the board of directors from time
to time may determine, and to issue the preferred stock in such series. The board of directors shall determine the number of shares
comprising each series, which number may, unless otherwise provided by the board of directors in creating such series, be increased
or decreased from time to time by action of the board of directors. Each series shall be so designated, as to distinguish the shares
thereof, from the shares of all other series. The board of directors shall have the authority to fix and determine the following
relative rights and preferences as of the shares of any such series of preferred stock (i) the rate of dividend, if any, (ii) whether
shares can be redeemed, and if so, the redemption price and the terms and conditions of the redemption, (iii) the amount payable
upon shares in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, (iv) sinking fund provision, if any, for redemption or purchase
of shares, (v) the terms and conditions, if any, under which shares may be converted to common stock, and (vi) the voting powers,
if any.

On behalf of TapImmune Inc., a Nevada corporation (the  Corporation ),
the undersigned hereby certifies that the following resolution has been duly adopted by the board of directors of the Corporation
(the  Board ): 

RESOLVED, that, pursuant to the authority granted to and vested
in the Board by the provisions of the articles of incorporation of the Corporation (the  Articles of Incorporation ),
there hereby is created, out of the five million (5,000,000) shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Corporation
authorized by Article III of the Articles of Incorporation ( Preferred Stock ), a series of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock, consisting of one million, two hundred and fifty thousand (1,250,000) shares, which series shall have the following powers,
designations, preferences and relative participating, optional and other special rights, and the following qualifications, limitations
and restrictions: 

The specific powers, preferences, rights and limitations of
the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are as follows: 

1.            Designation; Rank. This series of Preferred Stock shall
be designated and known as  Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.  The number of shares constituting the Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock shall be one million, two hundred and fifty thousand (1,250,000) shares. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall, with respect to rights on liquidation, winding up and dissolution, rank pari passu
to the common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ). 

2.            Dividends. The holders of shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock have no dividend rights except as may be declared by the Board in its sole and absolute discretion, out of funds
legally available for that purpose. 

3.            Liquidation Preference. 

(a)          In the event of any dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the Corporation (a  Liquidation ), whether voluntary or involuntary, the Holders of Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock shall be entitled to participate in any distribution out of the assets of the Corporation on a five
(5) to one basis per share with the holders of the Common Stock. 

(b)          A sale of all or substantially all
of the Corporation's assets or an acquisition of the Corporation by another entity by means of any transaction or series of related
transactions (including, without limitation, a reorganization, consolidated or merger) that results in the transfer of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding voting power of the Corporation (a  Change in Control Event ), shall not be deemed to
be a Liquidation for purposes of this Designation. 

4.            Voting. The holders of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock shall have the right to cast one thousand (1,000) votes for each share held of record on all matters submitted to a vote
of holders of the Corporation's common stock, including the election of directors, and all other matters as required by law. There
is no right to cumulative voting in the election of directors. The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall vote together with
all other classes and series of common stock of the Corporation as a single class on all actions to be taken by the common stock
holders of the Corporation except to the extent that voting as a separate class or series is required by law. 

5.            Conversion of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. 

(a)          Automatic conversion. Upon the occurrence
of a reverse stock split of the Corporation's common stock in which every 100 shares of the Corporation's common stock outstanding
at the time that this certificate of designation was filed with the Secretary of State of Nevada is exchanged for one share of
the Corporation's common stock, each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock shall automatically convert into five (5) shares
of the Corporation's common stock (such number to be after the aforementioned 100:1 reverse stock split), subject to adjustment
as provided in this Section. 

(b)          No Fractional Shares. No fractional
shares of Common Stock or scrip shall be issued upon conversion of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock. In lieu of any
fractional share to which the Holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall issue a number of shares to such Holder
rounded up to the nearest whole number of shares of Common Stock. No cash shall be paid to any Holder of Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock by the Corporation upon conversion of Series A Preferred Convertible Stock by such Holder. 

(c)          Stock Dividends, Splits, Combinations
and Reclassifications. If the Corporation shall (i) declare a dividend or other distribution payable in securities, (ii) split
its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number, (iii) combine its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number (other than the 100:1 reverse stock split referred to in Section 5(a)), or (iv) increase or decrease the number of shares
of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock including any such reclassification in connection with a merger,
consolidation or other business combination in which the Corporation is the continuing entity (any such corporate event, an  Event ),
then in each instance the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted such that the number of shares issued upon conversion of one share
of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock will equal the number of shares of Common Stock that would otherwise be issued but for
such Event. 

(d)         Issue Taxes. The converting Holder
shall pay any and all issue and other non-income taxes that may be payable in respect of any issue or delivery of shares of Common
Stock on conversion of shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.
