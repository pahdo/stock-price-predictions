           1. 
       Organization  : 
     The Macerich Company (the "Company") is involved in the acquisition, ownership, development, redevelopment, management and leasing of regional and community/power shopping centers (the "Centers") located throughout the United States. 
  The Company commenced operations effective with the completion of its initial public offering on March 16, 1994. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was the sole general partner of and held a   93%   ownership interest in The Macerich Partnership, L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"). The Company was organized to qualify as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). 
  The property management, leasing and redevelopment of the Company's portfolio is provided by the Company's management companies, Macerich Property Management Company, LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company, Macerich Management Company, a California corporation, Macerich Arizona Partners LLC, a single member Arizona limited liability company, Macerich Arizona Management LLC, a single member Delaware limited liability company, Macerich Partners of Colorado, LLC, a single member Colorado limited liability company, MACW Mall Management, Inc., a New York corporation, and MACW Property Management, LLC, a single member New York limited liability company. All   seven   of the management companies are collectively referred to herein as the "Management Companies." 
  All references to the Company in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include the Company, those entities owned or controlled by the Company and predecessors of the Company, unless the context indicates otherwise. 
   
           2. 
     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: 
     Basis of Presentation: 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements and have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. 
  On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  which made certain changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model, including changes to (1) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), (2) the variable interest entity ("VIE") characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination. The Company evaluated the new standard and determined that no change was required to its accounting for variable interest entities. However, under the guidance of the new standard, all of the Company's consolidated joint ventures, including the Operating Partnership, now meet the definition and criteria as VIEs and the Company is the primary beneficiary of each VIE. 
  The Company's sole significant asset is its investment in the Operating Partnership and as a result, substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities represent the assets and liabilities of the Operating Partnership. In addition, the Operating Partnership has investments in a number of VIEs.

  2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: (Continued) 

The Operating Partnership's VIEs included the following assets and liabilities: 

All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 
  The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements for the interim periods have been made. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements: 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue From Contracts With Customers,  which outlines a comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 states that  an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  While ASU 2014-09 specifically references contracts with customers, it may apply to certain other transactions such as the sale of real estate or equipment. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Accordingly, ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
   In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. The Company's adoption of ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016 resulted in an adjustment of its consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 to reflect the new presentation required by the standard.  
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments," which requires adjustments to provisional amounts used in business combinations during the measurement period to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. It also requires the disclosure of the impact on changes in estimates on earnings, depreciation, amortization and other income effects. The Company's adoption of this standard on January 1, 2016 did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements.

  2.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: (Continued) 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)," which requires lessees to record operating and financing leases as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet and lessors to expense costs that are not initial direct leasing costs. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718)," which amends the accounting for share-based payments, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash flows (Topic 230)," which amends the accounting for the statement of cash flows by providing guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

    Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures: 
     The Company has made the following recent investments and dispositions in its unconsolidated joint ventures: 
  On   February 17, 2015  , the Company acquired the remaining   50%   ownership interest in   Inland Center  , an   867,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   San Bernardino  ,   California  , that it did not previously own for   $51,250  . The purchase price was funded by a cash payment of   $26,250   and the assumption of the third party's share of the mortgage note payable on the property of   $25,000  . Concurrent with the purchase of the joint venture interest, the Company paid off the   $50,000   mortgage note payable on the property. The cash payment was funded by borrowings under the Company's line of credit. Prior to the acquisition, the Company had accounted for its investment in   Inland Center   under the equity method of accounting. Since the date of acquisition, the Company has included   Inland Center   in its consolidated financial statements (See Note   13     Acquisitions  ). 
  On   April 30, 2015  , the Company entered into a 50/50 joint venture with Sears to own   nine   freestanding stores located at   Arrowhead Towne Center  ,   Chandler Fashion Center  ,   Danbury Fair Mall  ,   Deptford Mall  ,   Freehold Raceway Mall  ,   Los Cerritos Center  ,   South Plains Mall  ,   Vintage Faire Mall   and   Washington Square  . The Company invested   $150,000   for a   50%   ownership interest in the joint venture, which was funded by borrowings under the Company's line of credit. 
  On   October 30, 2015  , the Company sold a   40%   ownership interest in   Pacific Premier Retail LLC   (the "PPR Portfolio"), which owns   Lakewood Center  , a   2,075,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Lakewood  ,   California  ;   Los Cerritos Center  , a   1,296,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Cerritos  ,   California  ;   South Plains Mall  , a   1,127,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Lubbock  ,   Texas  ; and   Washington Square  , a   1,441,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Portland  ,   Oregon  , for a total sales price of   $1,258,643  , resulting in a gain on the sale of assets of   $311,194  . The sales price was funded by a cash payment of   $545,643   and the assumption of a pro rata share of the mortgage notes payable on the properties of   $713,000  . The Company used the cash proceeds from the sale to pay down its line of credit and for general corporate purposes, which included funding the ASR and Special Dividend (See Note   12     Stockholders' Equity  ). Upon completion of the sale of the ownership interest, the Company no longer has a controlling interest in the joint venture due to the substantive participation rights of the outside partner. Accordingly, the Company accounts for its investment in the PPR Portfolio under the equity method of accounting. 
  On   January 6, 2016  , the Company sold a   40%   ownership interest in   Arrowhead Towne Center  , a   1,197,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Glendale  ,   Arizona  , for   $289,496  , resulting in a gain on the sale of assets of   $104,259  . The sales price was funded by a cash payment of   $129,496   and the assumption of a pro rata share of the mortgage note payable on the property of   $160,000  . The Company used the cash proceeds from the sale to pay down its line of credit and for general corporate purposes, which included funding the Special Dividend (See Note   12     Stockholders' Equity  ). Upon completion of the sale of the ownership interest, the Company no longer has a controlling interest in the joint venture due to the substantive participation rights of the outside partner. Accordingly, the Company accounts for its investment in   Arrowhead Towne Center   under the equity method of accounting. 
  On   January 14, 2016  , the Company formed a joint venture, whereby the Company sold a   49%   ownership interest in   Deptford Mall  , a   1,039,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Deptford  ,   New Jersey  ;   FlatIron Crossing  , a   1,432,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Broomfield  ,   Colorado  ; and   Twenty Ninth Street  , an   851,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Boulder  ,   Colorado   (the "  MAC Heitman Portfolio  "), for   $771,478  , resulting in a gain on the sale of assets of   $340,745  . The sales price was funded by a cash payment of   $478,608   and the assumption of a pro rata share of the mortgage notes payable on the properties of   $292,870  . The Company used the cash proceeds from the sale to pay down its line of credit and for general corporate purposes. Upon completion of the sale of the ownership interest, the Company no longer has a controlling interest in the joint venture due to the substantive participation rights of the outside partner. Accordingly, the Company accounts for its investment in the   MAC Heitman Portfolio   under the equity method of accounting. 
  On   March 1, 2016  , the Company, through a   50  /50 joint venture, acquired   Country Club Plaza  , a   1,246,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Kansas City  ,   Missouri  , for a purchase price of   $660,000  . The Company funded its pro rata share of the purchase price of   $330,000   from borrowings under its line of credit. On   March 28, 2016  , the joint venture placed a   $320,000   loan on the property that bears interest at an effective rate of   3.88%   and matures on   April 1, 2026  . The Company used its pro rata share of the proceeds to pay down its line of credit.

    Certain mortgage notes payable could become recourse debt to the Company should the joint venture be unable to discharge the obligations of the related debt. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , a total of   $5,000   could become recourse debt to the Company. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had an indemnity agreement from a joint venture partner for   $2,500   of the guaranteed amount. 
     Included in mortgage and other notes payable are amounts due to an affiliate of Northwestern Mutual Life ("NML") of   $267,200   and   $460,872   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. NML is considered a related party because it is a joint venture partner with the Company in Macerich Northwestern Associates Broadway Plaza. Interest expense on these borrowings was   $2,775   and   $6,385   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $14,133   and   $22,976   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

    These amounts exclude the results of operations from January 1, 2015 to   September 30, 2015  , as   Pacific Premier Retail LLC   was wholly-owned during that period. On October 30, 2015, as a result of the PPR Portfolio transaction discussed above,   Pacific Premier Retail LLC   was converted from wholly-owned to an unconsolidated joint venture. 
     Significant accounting policies used by the unconsolidated joint ventures are similar to those used by the Company.

(1) 
    The mortgage notes payable balances include the unamortized debt premiums (discounts). Debt premiums (discounts) represent the excess (deficiency) of the fair value of debt over (under) the principal value of debt assumed in various acquisitions and are amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt in a manner that approximates the effective interest method. Debt premiums (discounts) consist of the following: 

The mortgage notes payable balances also include unamortized deferred finance costs that are amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the related debt in a manner that approximates the effective interest method. Unamortized deferred finance costs were   $11,567   and   $16,025   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
           (2) 
    The interest rate disclosed represents the effective interest rate, including the debt premiums (discounts) and deferred finance costs. 
              (3) 
    The monthly debt service represents the payment of principal and interest. 
              (4) 
    The maturity date assumes that all extension options are fully exercised and that the Company does not opt to refinance the debt prior to these dates. These extension options are at the Company's discretion, subject to certain conditions, which the Company believes will be met. 
              (5) 
    On   January 6, 2016  , the Company replaced the existing loan on the property with a new   $400,000   loan that bears interest at an effective rate of   4.05%   and matures on   February 1, 2028  , which resulted in a loss of   $3,575   on the early extinguishment of debt. Concurrently, a   40%   interest in the loan was assumed by a third party in connection with the sale of a   40%   ownership interest in the underlying property (See Note   4     Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  ). 
              (6) 
    A   49.9%   interest in the loan has been assumed by a third party in connection with a co-venture arrangement (See Note   10     Co-Venture Arrangement  ). 
              (7) 
    On   January 14, 2016  , a   49%   interest in the loan was assumed by a third party in connection with the sale of a   49%   ownership interest in the   MAC Heitman Portfolio   (See Note   4     Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures  ). 
                (10) 
    On   July 15, 2016  , the Company conveyed the property to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, which resulted in a gain of   $5,284   on the extinguishment of debt (See Note   14     Dispositions  ). 
       Most of the mortgage loan agreements contain a prepayment penalty provision for the early extinguishment of the debt. 
  Most of the Company's mortgage notes payable are secured by the properties on which they are placed and are non-recourse to the Company. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , a total of   $13,500   of the mortgage notes payable could become recourse to the Company. 
  The Company expects that all loan maturities during the next twelve months will be refinanced, restructured, extended and/or paid-off from the Company's line of credit or with cash on hand.  
  Total interest expense capitalized was   $2,707   and   $3,629   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $7,572   and   $10,095   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

On   July 6, 2016  , the Company amended its line of credit. The amended   $1,500,000   line of credit bears interest at   LIBOR   plus a spread of   1.30%   to   1.90%  , depending on the Company's overall leverage level, and matures on   July 6, 2020   with a   one  -year extension option. The line of credit can be expanded, depending on certain conditions, up to a total facility of   $2,000,000  .

The estimated fair value (Level 2 measurement) of the line of credit at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $1,035,830   and   $640,260  , respectively, based on a present value model using a credit interest rate spread offered to the Company for comparable debt. 
  Prasada Note: 
  On March 29, 2013, the Company issued a   $13,330   note payable that bears interest at   5.25%   and was to mature on March 29, 2016. The maturity date of the note has been extended to May 30, 2021. The note payable is collateralized by a portion of a development reimbursement agreement with the City of Surprise, Arizona. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the note had a balance of   $5,821   and   $9,130  , respectively. The estimated fair value (Level 2 measurement) of the note at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $6,211   and   $9,168  , respectively, based on current interest rates for comparable notes. Fair value was determined using a present value model and an interest rate that included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the collateral for the underlying debt. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company was in compliance with all applicable financial loan covenants. 
   
           10. 
    Co-Venture Arrangement: 
     On   September 30, 2009  , the Company formed a joint venture, whereby a third party acquired a   49.9%   interest in Freehold Raceway Mall, a   1,674,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Freehold  ,   New Jersey  , and Chandler Fashion Center, a   1,319,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Chandler  ,   Arizona  .  
  As a result of the Company having certain rights under the agreement to repurchase the assets after the seventh year of the venture formation, the transaction did not qualify for sale treatment. The Company, however, is not obligated to repurchase the assets. The transaction has been accounted for as a profit-sharing arrangement, and accordingly the assets, liabilities and operations of the properties remain on the books of the Company and a co-venture obligation was established for the amount of   $168,154  , representing the net cash proceeds received from the third party. The co-venture obligation is increased for the allocation of income to the co-venture partner and decreased for distributions to the co-venture partner. The co-venture obligation was   $59,609   and   $63,756   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

11  .  Noncontrolling Interests: 
  The Company allocates net income of the Operating Partnership based on the weighted average ownership interest during the period. The net income of the Operating Partnership that is not attributable to the Company is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations as noncontrolling interests. The Company adjusts the noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership at the end of each period to reflect its ownership interest in the Company. The Company had a   93%   ownership interest in the Operating Partnership as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The remaining   7%   limited partnership interest as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was owned by certain of the Company's executive officers and directors, certain of their affiliates and other third party investors in the form of OP Units. The OP Units may be redeemed for shares of stock or cash, at the Company's option. The redemption value for each OP Unit as of any balance sheet date is the amount equal to the average of the closing price per share of the Company's common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange for the   10   trading days ending on the respective balance sheet date. Accordingly, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the aggregate redemption value of the then-outstanding OP Units not owned by the Company was   $864,182   and   $870,625  , respectively.

    Share and Unit-Based Plans: 
     Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"), each award recipient is issued a form of operating partnership units ("LTIP Units") in the Operating Partnership. Upon the occurrence of specified events and subject to the satisfaction of applicable vesting conditions, LTIP Units (after conversion into OP Units) are ultimately redeemable for common stock of the Company, or cash at the Company's option, on a   one  -unit for   one  -share basis. LTIP Units receive cash dividends based on the dividend amount paid on the common stock of the Company. The LTIP may include both market-indexed awards and service-based awards. The market-indexed LTIP Units vest over the service period of the award based on the percentile ranking of the Company in terms of total return to the stockholders (the "Total Return") per common stock share relative to the Total Return of a group of peer REITs, as measured at the end of the measurement period. 
  On   January 1, 2016  , the Company granted   58,786   LTIP Units with a grant date fair value of   $80.69   per LTIP Unit that will vest in equal annual installments over a service period ending   December 31, 2018  . Concurrently, the Company granted   266,899     market-indexed   LTIP Units ("2016 LTIP Units") at a grant date fair value of   $53.32   per LTIP Unit that vest over a service period ending   December 31, 2018  . The fair value of the 2016 LTIP Units was estimated on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo Simulation model that assumed a risk free interest rate of   1.32%   and an expected volatility of   20.31%  .  
  On   March 4, 2016  , the Company granted   154,686   LTIP Units at a fair value of   $79.20   per LTIP Unit that were fully vested on the grant date.  
  The following summarizes the compensation cost under the share and unit-based plans: 

The Company capitalized share and unit-based compensation costs of   $750   and   $551   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $6,490   and   $5,459   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Unrecognized compensation costs of share and unit-based plans at   September 30, 2016   consisted of   $7,602   from LTIP Units,   $4,696   from stock units,   $15   from stock options and   $610   from phantom stock units.

  On   August 5, 2016  , the Company s joint venture in   The Village at Corte Madera   replaced the existing loan on the property with a new   $225.0 million   loan that bears interest at an effective rate of   3.53%   and matures on   September 1, 2028  . The Company used its share of the excess proceeds to pay down its line of credit and for general corporate purposes. 
  On   October 6, 2016  , the Company placed a   $325.0 million   loan on   Fresno Fashion Fair   that bears interest at an effective rate of   3.67%   and matures on   November 1, 2026  . The Company used the proceeds to pay down its line of credit and for general corporate purposes. 
  Redevelopment and Development Activities: 
  In   February 2014  , the Company's joint venture in   Broadway Plaza   started construction on the   235,000   square foot expansion of the   921,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Walnut Creek  ,   California  . The joint venture completed a portion of the first phase of the project in   November 2015   and the remaining portion of the first phase was completed in September 2016. The second phase will be completed through Summer 2018. The total cost of the project is estimated to be   $305.0 million  , with   $152.5 million   estimated to be the Company's pro rata share. The Company has funded   $121.9 million   of the total   $243.8 million   incurred by the joint venture as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company is currently developing   Green Acres Commons  , a   335,000   square foot   community center   adjacent to   Green Acres Mall  , in   Valley Stream  ,   New York  . The project started in   July 2015   and opened in October 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has incurred   $96.3 million   in costs and estimates the total cost of the project to be approximately   $110.0 million  .  
  The Company's joint venture is proceeding with the development of   Fashion Outlets of Philadelphia  , a redevelopment of an   850,000   square foot shopping center in   Philadelphia  ,   Pennsylvania  . The project is expected to be completed in 2018. The total cost of the project is estimated to be between   $305.0 million   and   $365.0 million  , with   $152.5 million   to   $182.5 million   estimated to be the Company's pro rata share. The Company has funded   $40.1 million   of the total   $80.1 million   incurred by the joint venture as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Other Transactions and Events: 
  On March 9, 2015, the Company received an unsolicited, conditional proposal from Simon Property Group, Inc. ( Simon ) to acquire the Company. The Company s Board of Directors, after consulting with its financial, real estate and legal advisors, unanimously determined that the Simon proposal substantially undervalued the Company and was not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. On March 20, 2015, the Company received a revised, unsolicited proposal to acquire the Company from Simon, which Simon described as its best and final proposal. The Company s Board of Directors carefully reviewed the revised proposal with the assistance of its financial, real estate and legal advisors, and determined that the revised proposal continued to substantially undervalue the Company and that pursuing the proposed transaction at that time was not in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. 
  On   June 30, 2015  , the Company conveyed   Great Northern Mall  , an   895,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Clay  ,   New York  , to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and was discharged from the mortgage note payable. The mortgage note payable was a non-recourse loan. As a result, the Company recognized a loss of   $1.6 million   on the extinguishment of debt.  
  On   September 30, 2015  , the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $1.2 billion   of the Company's outstanding common shares over the period ending   September 30, 2017  , as market conditions warrant. On   November 12, 2015  , the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program ("ASR") to repurchase   $400.0 million   of the Company's common stock. In accordance with the ASR, the Company made a prepayment of   $400.0 million   and received an initial share delivery of   4,140,788   shares. On   January 19, 2016  , the ASR was completed and the Company received  delivery of an additional   970,609   shares. The average price of the   5,111,397   shares repurchased under the ASR was   $78.26   per share. The ASR was funded from proceeds in connection with the financing and sale of the ownership interest in the   PPR Portfolio   (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity"). 
  On October 30, 2015, the Company declared two special dividends/distributions ("Special Dividend"), each of $2.00 per share of common stock and per OP Unit. The first Special Dividend was paid on December 8, 2015 to stockholders and OP Unit holders of record on November 12, 2015.  The second Special Dividend was paid on January 6, 2016 to common

stockholders and OP Unit holders of record on November 12, 2015. The Special Dividends were funded from proceeds in connection with the financing and sale of ownership interests in the   PPR Portfolio   and   Arrowhead Towne Center   (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity"). 
  On   February 17, 2016  , the Company entered into an ASR to repurchase   $400.0 million   of the Company's common stock. In accordance with the ASR, the Company made a prepayment of   $400.0 million   and received an initial share delivery of   4,222,193   shares. On   April 19, 2016  , the ASR was completed and the Company received delivery of an additional   861,235   shares. The average price of the   5,083,428   shares repurchased under the ASR was   $78.69   per share. The ASR was funded from borrowings under the Company's line of credit, which had been paid down from the proceeds from the recently completed Joint Venture Transactions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity"). 
  On   May 9, 2016  , the Company entered into an ASR to repurchase the remaining   $400.0 million   of the Company's common stock authorized for repurchase. In accordance with the ASR, the Company made a prepayment of   $400.0 million   and received an initial share delivery of   3,964,812   shares. On   July 11, 2016  , the ASR was completed and the Company received delivery of an additional   1,104,162   shares. The average price of the   5,068,974   shares repurchased under the ASR was   $78.91   per share. The ASR was funded from borrowings under the Company's line of credit, which had been recently paid down from the proceeds from the recently completed Joint Venture Transactions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Financing Activity"). The total number of shares repurchased under the   $1.2 billion   stock buyback program was   15,263,799   at an average price of   $78.62  .  
  On   July 15, 2016  , the Company conveyed   Flagstaff Mall  , a   347,000   square foot   regional shopping center   in   Flagstaff  ,   Arizona  , to the mortgage lender by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure and was discharged from the mortgage note payable. The mortgage note payable was a non-recourse loan. As a result, the Company recognized a gain of   $5.3 million   on the extinguishment of debt.  
  Inflation: 
  In the last five years, inflation has not had a significant impact on the Company because of a relatively low inflation rate. Most of the leases at the Centers have rent adjustments periodically throughout the lease term. These rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). In addition, approximately 6% to 13% of the leases for spaces 10,000 square feet and under expire each year, which enables the Company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate. The Company has generally entered into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses, generally excluding property taxes, regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any Center, which places the burden of cost control on the Company. Additionally, certain leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses. 
  Seasonality: 
  The shopping center industry is seasonal in nature, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels. In addition, shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty (temporary retailer) rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter. As a result of the above, earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition, estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals, provisions for uncollectible accounts, impairment of long-lived assets, the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets, capitalization of costs and fair value measurements. The Company's significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. However, the following policies are deemed to be critical. 
  Revenue Recognition: 
  Minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease. The difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the "straight line rent adjustment." Currently,   59%   of the Mall Store and Freestanding Store leases contain provisions for CPI rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease. The Company believes that using an annual multiple of CPI increases, rather than  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

fixed contractual rent increases, results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases. Percentage rents are recognized when the tenants' specified sales targets have been met. Estimated recoveries from certain tenants for their pro rata share of real estate taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred. Other tenants pay a fixed rate and these tenant recoveries are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the related leases. 
  Property: 
  Maintenance and repair expenses are charged to operations as incurred. Costs for major replacements and betterments, which includes HVAC equipment, roofs, parking lots, etc., are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings. 
  Property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: 
                 Buildings and improvements 
    5 - 40 years 
      Tenant improvements 
    5 - 7 years 
      Equipment and furnishings 
    5 - 7 years 

Capitalization of Costs: 
  The Company capitalizes costs incurred in redevelopment, development, renovation and improvement of properties. The capitalized costs include pre-construction costs essential to the development of the property, development costs, construction costs, interest costs, real estate taxes, salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development. These capitalized costs include direct and certain indirect costs clearly associated with the project. Indirect costs include real estate taxes, insurance and certain shared administrative costs. In assessing the amounts of direct and indirect costs to be capitalized, allocations are made to projects based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent on each activity. Indirect costs not clearly associated with specific projects are expensed as period costs. Capitalized indirect costs are allocated to development and redevelopment activities based on the square footage of the portion of the building not held available for immediate occupancy. If costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease, then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed. Once work has been completed on a vacant space, project costs are no longer capitalized. For projects with extended lease-up periods, the Company ends the capitalization when significant activities have ceased, which does not exceed the shorter of a one-year period after the completion of the building shell or when the construction is substantially complete. 
  Acquisitions: 
  The Company allocates the estimated fair value of acquisitions to land, building, tenant improvements and identified intangible assets and liabilities, based on their estimated fair values. In addition, any assumed mortgage notes payable are recorded at their estimated fair values. The estimated fair value of the land and buildings is determined utilizing an  as if vacant  methodology. Tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms. The tenant improvements are classified as an asset under property and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (i) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with  cost avoidance  of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the Company's markets; (ii) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the  assumed vacant  property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (iii) above or below-market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. Leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms. The value of in-place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus any below-market fixed rate renewal options. Above or below-market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below-market, and the asset or liability is amortized to minimum rents over the remaining terms of the leases. The remaining lease terms of below-market leases may include certain below-market fixed-rate renewal periods. In considering whether or not a lessee will execute a below-market fixed-rate lease renewal option, the Company evaluates economic factors and certain qualitative factors at the time of acquisition such as tenant mix in the Center, the Company's relationship with the tenant and the availability of competing tenant space. The initial allocation of purchase price is based on management's preliminary assessment, which may change when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  

made to the initial purchase price allocation are made within the allocation period, which does not exceed one year. The purchase price allocation is described as preliminary if it is not yet final. The use of different assumptions in the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired assets and liabilities assumed could affect the timing of recognition of the related revenues and expenses. 
  The Company immediately expenses costs associated with business combinations as period costs.   
  Remeasurement gains are recognized when the Company obtains control of an existing equity method investment to the extent that the fair value of the existing equity investment exceeds the carrying value of the investment. 
  Asset Impairment: 
  The Company assesses whether an indicator of impairment in the value of its properties exists by considering expected future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of demand, competition and other economic factors. Such factors include projected rental revenue, operating costs and capital expenditures as well as estimated holding periods and capitalization rates. If an impairment indicator exists, the determination of recoverability is made based upon the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows, excluding interest expense. The amount of impairment loss, if any, is determined by comparing the fair value, as determined by a discounted cash flows analysis, with the carrying value of the related assets. The Company generally holds and operates its properties long-term, which decreases the likelihood of their carrying values not being recoverable. Properties classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. 
  The Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures for a series of operating losses and other factors that may indicate that a decrease in the value of its investments has occurred which is other-than-temporary. The investment in each unconsolidated joint venture is evaluated periodically, and as deemed necessary, for recoverability and valuation declines that are other-than-temporary. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments: 
  The fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions. 
  Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which is typically based on an entity's own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company's assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
  The Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments and includes this additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of those financial instruments. When the fair value reasonably approximates the carrying value, no additional disclosure is made. 
  Deferred Charges: 
  Costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight-line method. As these deferred leasing costs represent productive assets incurred in connection with the Company's provision of leasing arrangements at the Centers, the related cash flows are classified as investing activities within the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows. Costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method. The ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows:

Results of Operations 
  Many of the variations in the results of operations, discussed below, occurred because of the transactions affecting the Company's properties described in Management's Overview and Summary above, including the   Redevelopment Properties  , the   Joint Venture Centers   and the   Disposition Properties   (as defined below).  
  For purposes of the discussion below, the Company defines "  Same Centers  " as those Centers that are substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Non-Same Centers for comparison purposes include those Centers or properties that are going through a substantial redevelopment often resulting in the closing of a portion of the Center (   Redevelopment Properties   ), those properties that have recently transitioned to or from equity method joint ventures to consolidated assets ("  Joint Venture Centers  ") and properties that have been disposed of ("  Disposition Properties  "). The Company moves a Center in and out of   Same Centers   based on whether the Center is substantially complete and in operation for the entirety of both periods of the comparison. Accordingly, the   Same Centers   consist of all consolidated Centers, excluding the   Redevelopment Properties  , the   Joint Venture Centers   and the   Disposition Properties   for the periods of comparison. 
  For the comparison of the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the   Redevelopment Properties   are   Green Acres Commons  ,   Paradise Valley Mall   and   Westside Pavilion  .  
  For the comparison of the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   to the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , the   Joint Venture Centers   are the   PPR Portfolio  ,   Arrowhead Towne Center   and the   MAC Heitman Portfolio  . For the comparison of the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the   Joint Venture Centers   are   Inland Center  , the   PPR Portfolio  ,   Arrowhead Towne Center   and the   MAC Heitman Portfolio  . The change in revenues and expenses at the   Joint Venture Centers   for the comparison of the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   is primarily due to the conversion of the   PPR Portfolio  ,   Arrowhead Towne Center   and the   MAC Heitman Portfolio   from consolidated Centers to unconsolidated joint ventures. 
  For comparison of the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the   Disposition Properties   are   Flagstaff Mall  ,   Capitola Mall  ,   Panorama Mall   and   Great Northern Mall  .  
  Unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected using the equity method of accounting. The Company's pro rata share of the results from these Centers is reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures. 
  The Company considers tenant annual sales per square foot (for tenants in place for a minimum of twelve months or longer and 10,000 square feet and under) for regional shopping centers, occupancy rates (excluding large retail stores or "Anchors") for the Centers and releasing spreads (i.e. a comparison of initial average base rent per square foot on leases executed during the trailing twelve months to average base rent per square foot at expiration for the leases expiring during the trailing twelve months based on the spaces 10,000 square feet and under) to be key performance indicators of the Company's internal growth. 
  Tenant sales per square foot decreased from   $630   for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $626   for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . Occupancy rate decreased from   95.4%   at   September 30, 2015   to   95.3%   at   September 30, 2016  . Releasing spreads increased   16.1%   for the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . These calculations exclude Centers under development or redevelopment and property dispositions (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" and "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary).  
  Releasing spreads remained positive as the Company was able to lease available space at higher average rents than the expiring rental rates, resulting in a releasing spread of   $7.84   per square foot (  $56.52   on new and renewal leases executed compared to   $48.68   on leases expiring), representing a   16.1%   increase for the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company expects that releasing spreads will continue to be positive for the remainder of 2016 as it renews or relets leases that are scheduled to expire. These leases that are scheduled to expire represent   1.0 million   square feet of the Centers, accounting for   12.9%   of the gross leasable area ("GLA") of Mall Stores and Freestanding Stores, for spaces 10,000 square feet and under, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  During the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company signed   283   new leases and   356   renewal leases comprising approximately   1.2 million   square feet of GLA, of which   0.8 million   square feet related to the consolidated Centers. The annual initial average base rent for new and renewal leases was   $56.52   per square foot for the trailing twelve months ended   September 30, 2016   with an average tenant allowance of   $13.54   per square foot.

Comparison of   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  Revenues: 
  Minimum and percentage rents (collectively referred to as "rental revenue")   decreased   by   $42.3 million  , or   21.1%  , from   2015   to   2016  . The decrease in rental revenue is attributed to a decrease of   $50.9 million   from the   Joint Venture Centers   and   $4.3 million   from the   Disposition Properties   offset in part by an increase of   $12.6 million   from the   Same Centers   and   $0.3 million   from the   Redevelopment Properties  . Rental revenue includes the amortization of above and below-market leases, the amortization of straight-line rents and lease termination income. The amortization of above and below-market leases   increased   from   $4.1 million   in   2015   to   $4.9 million   in   2016  . The amortization of straight-line rents   decreased   from   $2.8 million   in   2015   to   $0.9 million   in   2016  . Lease termination income   increased   from   $3.1 million   in   2015   to   $7.8 million   in   2016  . The increase in rental revenue at the Same Centers is primarily due to an increase in lease termination income and an increase in leasing spreads.  
  Tenant recoveries   decreased     $31.9 million  , or   30.0%  , from   2015   to   2016  . This decrease in tenant recoveries is attributed to a decrease of   $25.3 million   from the   Joint Venture Centers  ,   $4.8 million   from the   Same Centers  ,   $1.7 million   from the   Disposition Properties   and   $0.1 million   from the   Redevelopment Properties  .  
  Management Companies' revenue   increased   from   $5.3 million   in   2015   to   $9.0 million   in   2016  . The increase in Management Companies' revenue is due to an increase in management fees as a result of the conversion from consolidated Centers to unconsolidated joint ventures of the   PPR Portfolio   in   2015  ,   Arrowhead Towne Center   in 2016 and the   MAC Heitman Portfolio   in   2016   (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and an increase in development and leasing fees from other joint ventures.  
  Shopping Center and Operating Expenses: 
  Shopping center and operating expenses   decreased     $18.6 million  , or   19.6%  , from   2015   to   2016  . The decrease in shopping center and operating expenses is attributed to a decrease of   $19.4 million   from the   Joint Venture Centers   and   $1.8 million   from the   Disposition Properties   offset in part by an increase of   $2.1 million   from the   Same Centers   and   $0.5 million   from the   Redevelopment Properties  . 
  Management Companies' Operating Expenses: 
  Management Companies' operating expenses   increased     $2.3 million   from   2015   to   2016   as a result of the conversion from consolidated Centers to unconsolidated joint ventures of the   PPR Portfolio   in   2015  ,   Arrowhead Towne Center   in 2016 and the   MAC Heitman Portfolio   in   2016   (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). 
  REIT General and Administrative Expenses: 
  REIT general and administrative expenses   increased   by   $0.2 million   from   2015   to   2016  . 
  Depreciation and Amortization: 
  Depreciation and amortization   decreased     $30.5 million   from   2015   to   2016  . The decrease in depreciation and amortization is attributed to a decrease of   $31.9 million   from the   Joint Venture Centers  ,   $1.6 million   from the   Disposition Properties   and   $0.1 million   from the   Redevelopment Properties   offset in part by an increase of   $3.1 million   from the   Same Centers  . 
  Interest Expense: 
  Interest expense   decreased     $15.0 million   from   2015   to   2016  . The decrease in interest expense is attributed to a decrease of   $10.6 million   from the   Joint Venture Centers  ,   $5.4 million   from the   Same Centers  ,   $0.7 million   from the   term loan   and   $0.3 million   from the   Disposition Properties   offset in part by an increase of   $1.0 million   from borrowings under the Company's line of credit and   $1.0 million   from the   Redevelopment Properties  . The decrease in interest expense at the   Same Centers   is primarily due to the payoff of the mortgage notes payable on   Eastland Mall   and   Valley River Center   in 2015. 
  The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which   decreased   from   $3.6 million   in   2015   to   $2.7 million   in   2016  . 
  (Gain) loss on Extinguishment of Debt, net: 
  Gain on extinguishment of debt, net increased $5.3 million from 2015 to 2016. The increase in gain on extinguishment of debt, net is primarily due to the settlement of the mortgage note payable on Flagstaff Mall by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure in 2016 (See  Other Transactions and Events  in Management s Overview and Summary).

  Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures   increased     $0.4 million   from   2015   to   2016  . 
  (Loss) Gain on Sale or Write Down of Assets, net: 
  Loss on sale or write down of assets, net increased   $16.0 million   from   2015   to   2016  . The increase in loss on sale or write down of assets is primarily due to an increase in loss on impairment of   $19.0 million   offset in part by a reduction of   $2.6 million   from a contingent consideration obligation in   2016  . The increase in impairment loss is due to the reduction in the estimated holding period of   Promenade at Casa Grande  . 
  Net Income: 
  Net income   decreased     $23.1 million   from   2015   to   2016   primarily due a decrease of   $72.9 million   in   total revenues   and an increase of   $16.0 million   in the loss on sale or write down of assets, net offset in part by a decrease of   $67.1 million   in   total expenses  . 
  Funds From Operations ("FFO"): 
  Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders diluted   decreased     6.0%   from   $170.5 million   in   2015   to   $160.3 million   in   2016  . For a reconciliation of FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders and FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders diluted to net income attributable to the Company, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see "Funds From Operations ("FFO")" below. 
   
  Comparison of   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  Revenues: 
  Rental revenue   decreased   by   $123.1 million  , or   20.9%  , from   2015   to   2016  . The decrease in rental revenue is attributed to a decrease of   $146.2 million   from the   Joint Venture Centers   and   $11.5 million   from the   Disposition Properties   offset in part by an increase of   $34.2 million   from the   Same Centers  . and   $0.4 million   from the   Redevelopment Properties  . The amortization of above and below-market leases   decreased   from   $13.9 million   in   2015   to   $9.1 million   in   2016  . The amortization of straight-line rents   decreased   from   $4.5 million   in   2015   to   $3.4 million   in   2016  . Lease termination income   increased   from   $8.0 million   in   2015   to   $15.5 million   in   2016  . The increase in rental revenue at the Same Centers is primarily due to an increase in lease termination income and an increase in leasing spreads. 
  Tenant recoveries   decreased     $87.1 million  , or   27.4%  , from   2015   to   2016  . The decrease in tenant recoveries is attributed to a decrease of   $72.0 million   from the   Joint Venture Centers  ,   $8.6 million   from the   Same Centers  ,   $5.4 million   from the   Disposition Properties   and   $1.1 million   from the   Redevelopment Properties  . 
  Management Companies' revenue   increased   from   $17.1 million   in   2015   to   $28.9 million   in   2016  . The increase in Management Companies' revenue is due to an increase in management fees as a result of the conversion from consolidated Centers to unconsolidated joint ventures of the   PPR Portfolio   in   2015  ,   Arrowhead Towne Center   in 2016 and the   MAC Heitman Portfolio   in   2016   (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and an increase in development and leasing fees from other joint ventures. 
  Shopping Center and Operating Expenses: 
  Shopping center and operating expenses   decreased     $60.9 million  , or   21.0%  , from   2015   to   2016  . The decrease in shopping center and operating expenses is attributed to a decrease of   $56.3 million   from the   Joint Venture Centers  ,   $6.4 million   from the   Disposition Properties   and   $0.2 million   from the   Redevelopment Properties   offset in part by an increase of   $2.0 million   from the   Same Centers  . 
  Management Companies' Operating Expenses: 
  Management Companies' operating expenses   increased     $7.8 million   from   2015   to   2016   due to the conversion from consolidated Centers to unconsolidated joint ventures of the   PPR Portfolio   in   2015  ,   Arrowhead Towne Center   in 2016 and the   MAC Heitman Portfolio   in   2016   (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary) and an increase in share and unit-based compensation costs.

REIT General and Administrative Expenses: 
  REIT general and administrative expenses   increased   by   $0.6 million   from   2015   to   2016  . 
  Costs related to Unsolicited Takeover Offer: 
  The Company incurred   $25.2 million   in costs in 2015 related to evaluating and responding to an unsolicited takeover offer (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) with no related expense in 2016. 
  Depreciation and Amortization: 
  Depreciation and amortization   decreased     $98.3 million   from   2015   to   2016  . The decrease in depreciation and amortization is attributed to a decrease of   $97.9 million   from the   Joint Venture Centers  ,   $3.9 million   from the   Disposition Properties   and   $0.6 million   from the   Redevelopment Properties   offset in part by an increase of   $4.1 million   from the Same Centers. 
  Interest Expense: 
  Interest expense   decreased     $42.2 million   from   2015   to   2016  . The decrease in interest expense was attributed to decreases of   $27.0 million   from the   Joint Venture Centers  ,   $11.8 million   from the   Same Centers  ,   $2.3 million   from the term loan,   $1.2 million   from the   Disposition Properties   and   $1.0 million   from the   Redevelopment Properties   offset in part by an increase of   $1.1 million   from borrowings under the Company's line of credit. The decrease in interest expense at the   Same Centers   is primarily due to the payoff of the mortgage notes payable on   Eastland Mall   and   Valley River Center   in 2015. 
  The above interest expense items are net of capitalized interest, which   decreased   from   $10.1 million   in   2015   to   $7.6 million   in   2016  . 
  (Gain) loss on Extinguishment of Debt, net: 
  Gain on extinguishment of debt, net increased $1.1 million from 2015 to 2016.  The gain on extinguishment of debt, net in 2016 was due to a gain of $5.3 million from the settlement of the mortgage note payable on Flagstaff Mall by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (See  Other Transactions and Events  in Management s Overview and Summary) offset in part by a loss of $3.6 million on the early extinguishment of debt on Arrowhead Towne Center (See  Financing Activity  in Management s Overview and Summary). The gain on extinguishment of debt, net in 2015 was due to a gain of $2.2 million on the early extinguishment of debt on Lakewood Center (See  Financing Activity  in Management s Overview and Summary) offset in part by a loss of $1.6 million from the settlement of the mortgage note payable on Great Northern Mall by a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure (See  Other Transactions and Events  in Management s Overview and Summary). 
  Equity in Income of Unconsolidated Joint Ventures: 
  Equity in income of unconsolidated joint ventures   increased     $9.4 million   from   2015   to   2016  . The increase is primarily due to the opening of the   Hyatt Regency Tysons Corner Center   and   VITA Tysons Corner Center   in 2015, the acquisition of an ownership interest in the Sears joint venture in 2015 and the acquisition of an ownership interest in   Country Club Plaza   in   2016   (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). 
  (Loss) Gain on Sale or Write Down of Assets, net: 
  The change in (loss) gain on sale or write down of assets, net from   2015   to   2016   was a net gain of   $433.1 million  , resulting from a loss of   $7.1 million   in   2015   and a gain of   $426.1 million   in   2016  . The change is primarily due to the gain on the sale of a 49% interest in the   MAC Heitman Portfolio   of   $340.7 million   in 2016, the gain on the sale of a 40% interest in   Arrowhead Towne Center   of   $104.3 million   in 2016 and the gain on the sale of   Capitola Mall   of   $24.9 million   in 2016 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). 
  Gain on Remeasurement of Assets: 
  The gain on remeasurement of assets of   $22.1 million   in 2015 is attributed to the purchase of the remaining   50%   ownership interest in   Inland Center   that the Company did not previously own (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). 
  Net Income: 
  Net income   increased     $435.3 million   from   2015   to   2016  . The increase is primarily attributed to the increase in gain on sale or write down of assets of   $433.1 million   as discussed above.

Funds From Operations ("FFO"): 
  Primarily as a result of the factors mentioned above, FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders diluted   increased     1.5%   from   $455.0 million   in   2015   to   $461.7 million   in   2016  . For a reconciliation of FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders and FFO attributable to common stockholders and unit holders diluted to net income attributable to the Company, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, see "Funds From Operations ("FFO")" below. 
  Operating Activities: 
  Cash provided by operating activities decreased from   $413.7 million   in   2015   to   $319.1 million   in   2016  . The decrease is primarily due to the conversion from consolidated Centers to unconsolidated joint ventures of the   PPR Portfolio   in   2015  ,   Arrowhead Towne Center   in 2016 and the   MAC Heitman Portfolio   in   2016   (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), changes in assets and liabilities and the results as discussed above. 
  Investing Activities: 
  Cash provided by investing activities   increased     $1.0 billion   from   2015   to   2016  . The increase in cash provided by investing activities is primarily attributed to an increase in cash proceeds from the sale of assets of   $685.1 million   and an increase in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of   $344.8 million  .  
  The increase in cash proceeds from the sale of assets is attributed to the sales of ownership interests in   Arrowhead Towne Center   and the   MAC Heitman Portfolio   in 2016 and from the sale of   Capitola Mall   in 2016 (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary). The increase in distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures is primarily due to the receipt of the Company's share of the net proceeds from the loans placed on   Country Club Plaza  ,   The Shops at North Bridge   and   The Village at Corte Madera   in 2016 (See "Financing Activity" in Management's Overview and Summary). 
  Financing Activities: 
  Cash used in financing activities increased   $961.7 million   from   2015   to   2016  . The increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily due to the repurchases of the Company's common stock of   $800.0 million   (See "Other Transactions" in Management's Overview and Summary), an increase in payments on mortgages, bank and other notes payable of   $762.3 million   and an increase in cash dividends and distributions of   $335.4 million   offset in part by an increase in proceeds from mortgages, bank and other notes payable of   $915.5 million  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The Company anticipates meeting its liquidity needs for its operating expenses, debt service and dividend requirements for the next twelve months through cash generated from operations, working capital reserves and/or borrowings under its unsecured line of credit. The following tables summarize capital expenditures incurred at the Centers: 

The Company expects amounts to be incurred during the next twelve months for tenant allowances and deferred leasing charges to be comparable or less than 2015 and that capital for those expenditures will be available from working capital, cash flow from operations, borrowings on property specific debt or unsecured corporate borrowings. The Company expects to incur between $300 million and $400 million during the next twelve months for development, redevelopment, expansion and renovations. Capital for these major expenditures, developments and/or redevelopments has been, and is expected to continue to be, obtained from a combination of debt or equity financings, which are expected to include borrowings under the Company's line of credit and construction loans.  
  The Company has also generated liquidity in the past through equity offerings and issuances, property refinancings, joint venture transactions and the sale of non-core assets. For example, the Company recently completed the Joint Venture Transactions to which the Company sold ownership interests in eight properties with total cash proceeds to the Company of approximately $2.3 billion (See "Acquisitions and Dispositions" in Management's Overview and Summary), which included new debt or refinancings of existing debt on these properties with excess financing proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion (See "Financing Activity" in Management's Overview and Summary). The Company used these proceeds to pay down its line of credit, fund the Special Dividend (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary) and for other general corporate purposes, which included the repurchases of the Company's common stock under the recently authorized stock buyback program (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary). Furthermore, the Company has filed a shelf registration statement, which registered an unspecified amount of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, debt securities, warrants, rights, stock purchase contracts and units that may be sold from time to time by the Company. 
  The capital and credit markets can fluctuate and, at times, limit access to debt and equity financing for companies. As demonstrated by the Company's recent activity as discussed below and its recently amended $1.5 billion line of credit, the Company has been able to access capital; however, there is no assurance the Company will be able to do so in future periods or on similar terms and conditions. Many factors impact the Company's ability to access capital, such as its overall debt level, interest rates, interest coverage ratios and prevailing market conditions. In the event that the Company has significant tenant defaults as a result of the overall economy and general market conditions, the Company could have a decrease in cash flow from operations, which could result in increased borrowings under its line of credit. These events could result in an increase in the Company's proportion of floating rate debt, which would cause it to be subject to interest rate fluctuations in the future. 
  The Company has an equity distribution agreement with a number of sales agents (the "ATM Program") to issue and sell, from time to time, shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, having an aggregate offering price of up to   $500 million   (the  ATM Shares ). Sales of the ATM Shares can be made in privately negotiated transactions and/or any other method permitted by law, including sales deemed to be an  at the market  offering, which includes sales made directly on the New

York Stock Exchange or sales made to or through a market maker other than on an exchange. The Company did not sell any shares under the ATM Program during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , $500 million of the ATM Shares were available to be sold under the ATM Program. Actual future sales of the ATM Shares will depend upon a variety of factors including but not limited to market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock and the Company's capital needs. The Company has no obligation to sell the ATM Shares under the ATM Program. 
  The Company's total outstanding loan indebtedness at   September 30, 2016   was   $7.5 billion   (consisting of   $4.9 billion   of consolidated debt, less   $0.2 billion   of noncontrolling interests, plus   $2.8 billion   of its pro rata share of unconsolidated joint venture debt). The majority of the Company's debt consists of fixed-rate conventional mortgage notes collateralized by individual properties. The Company expects that all of the maturities during the next twelve months will be refinanced, restructured, extended and/or paid off from the Company's line of credit or cash on hand. 
  The Company believes that the pro rata debt provides useful information to investors regarding its financial condition because it includes the Company s share of debt from unconsolidated joint ventures and, for consolidated debt, excludes the Company s partners  share from consolidated joint ventures, in each case presented on the same basis. The Company has several significant joint ventures and presenting its pro rata share of debt in this manner can help investors better understand the Company s financial condition after taking into account our economic interest in these joint ventures. The Company s pro rata share of debt should not be considered as a substitute for the Company s total consolidated debt determined in accordance with GAAP or any other GAAP financial measures and should only be considered together with and as a supplement to the Company s financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
  The Company has a   $1.5 billion   revolving line of credit facility that bore interest at   LIBOR   plus a spread of   1.38%   to   2.0%  , depending on the Company's overall leverage level, and was to mature on August 6, 2018. On   July 6, 2016  , the Company amended its line of credit. The amended   $1.5 billion   line of credit bears interest at   LIBOR   plus a spread of   1.30%   to   1.90%  , depending on the Company's overall leverage level, and matures on   July 6, 2020   with a one-year extension option. The line of credit can be expanded, depending on certain conditions, up to a total facility of   $2.0 billion  . All obligations under the facility are unconditionally guaranteed only by the Company. Based on the Company's leverage level as of   September 30, 2016  , the borrowing rate on the facility was LIBOR plus   1.45%  . At   September 30, 2016  , total borrowings under the line of credit were   $1.1 billion   less unamortized deferred finance costs of   $11.9 million   with a total interest rate of   2.15%  . 
  Cash dividends and distributions for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $667.8 million  , which included $337.7 million of the Special Dividend (See "Other Transactions and Events" in Management's Overview and Summary).  A total of   $319.1 million   was funded by operations. The remaining   $348.7 million   was funded from proceeds from the sale of assets, which were included in the cash flows from investing activities section of the Company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all applicable loan covenants under its agreements. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had cash and cash equivalents of   $84.2 million  . 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: 
  The Company accounts for its investments in joint ventures that it does not have a controlling interest or is not the primary beneficiary using the equity method of accounting and those investments are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures. 
  In addition, certain joint ventures also have secured debt that could become recourse debt to the Company or its subsidiaries, in excess of the Company's pro rata share, should the joint ventures be unable to discharge the obligations of the related debt. At   September 30, 2016  , the balance of the debt that could be recourse to the Company was   $5.0 million   offset in part by an indemnity agreement from a joint venture partner for   $2.5 million  . The maturity of the recourse debt, net of the indemnification, is   $2.5 million   in   2019  . 
  Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was contingently liable for   $61.0 million   in letters of credit guaranteeing performance by the Company of certain obligations relating to the Centers. The Company does not believe that these letters of credit will result in a liability to the Company.

Funds From Operations ("FFO") 
  The Company uses FFO in addition to net income to report its operating and financial results and considers FFO and FFO-diluted as supplemental measures for the real estate industry and a supplement to GAAP measures. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from extraordinary items and sales of depreciated operating properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, impairment write-downs of real estate and write-downs of investments in an affiliate where the write-downs have been driven by a decrease in the value of real estate held by the affiliate and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis.  
  FFO and FFO on a diluted basis are useful to investors in comparing operating and financial results between periods. This is especially true since FFO excludes real estate depreciation and amortization, as the Company believes real estate values fluctuate based on market conditions rather than depreciating in value ratably on a straight-line basis over time. The Company believes that such a presentation also provides investors with a meaningful measure of its operating results in comparison to the operating results of other REITs. The Company further believes that FFO on a diluted basis is a measure investors find most useful in measuring the dilutive impact of outstanding convertible securities. 
  The Company believes that FFO does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by GAAP, and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs. The Company also cautions that FFO, as presented, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other REITs. 
  Management compensates for the limitations of FFO by providing investors with financial statements prepared according to GAAP, along with this detailed discussion of FFO and a reconciliation of FFO and FFO-diluted to net income. Management believes that to further understand the Company's performance, FFO should be compared with the Company's reported net income and considered in addition to cash flows in accordance with GAAP, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     The Company's primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk. The Company has managed and will continue to manage interest rate risk by (1) maintaining a ratio of fixed rate, long-term debt to total debt such that floating rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level, (2) reducing interest rate exposure on certain long-term floating rate debt through the use of interest rate caps and/or swaps with matching maturities where appropriate, (3) using treasury rate locks where appropriate to fix rates on anticipated debt transactions, and (4) taking advantage of favorable market conditions for long-term debt and/or equity. 
  The following table sets forth information as of   September 30, 2016   concerning the Company's long-term debt obligations, including principal cash flows by scheduled maturity, weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value (dollars in thousands): 

The consolidated Centers' total fixed rate debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $3.5 billion   and   $4.3 billion  , respectively. The average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   3.81%   and   3.80%  , respectively. The consolidated Centers' total floating rate debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $1.4 billion   and   $1.0 billion  , respectively. The average interest rate on such floating rate debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   2.22%   and   2.03%  , respectively. 
  The Company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture Centers' fixed rate debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $2.7 billion   and   $1.8 billion  , respectively. The average interest rate on such fixed rate debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   3.80%   and   4.13%  , respectively. The Company's pro rata share of the unconsolidated joint venture Centers' floating rate debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $170.0 million   and   $170.5 million  , respectively. The average interest rate on such floating rate debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   2.31%   and   2.06%  , respectively. 
  In addition, the Company has assessed the market risk for its floating rate debt and believes that a 1% increase in interest rates would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately   $15.6 million   per year based on   $1.6 billion   of floating rate debt outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is estimated based on a present value model utilizing interest rates that reflect the risks associated with long-term debt of similar risk and duration. In addition, the method of computing fair value for mortgage notes payable included a credit value adjustment based on the estimated value of the property that serves as collateral for the underlying debt (See Note   8     Mortgage Notes Payable   and Note   9     Bank and Other Notes Payable   in the Company's Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements).

    Controls and Procedures 
     As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on their evaluation as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is (a) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and (b) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  In addition, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the Company's most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
