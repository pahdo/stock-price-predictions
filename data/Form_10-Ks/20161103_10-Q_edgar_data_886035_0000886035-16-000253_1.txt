  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
   
  1.  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of General Cable Corporation and Subsidiaries ( General Cable  or the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Results of operations for the   nine   fiscal months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year. The   December 31, 2015   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet amounts are derived from the audited financial statements. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto in General Cable s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on   February 29, 2016  .  
  The results of the Asia Pacific businesses ("Asia Pacific") are presented in continuing operations for all periods disclosed in this report. Previously, the results of these businesses were presented as discontinued operations; however, in the third quarter of 2016 management determined that the held for sale criteria is no longer met for its China, New Zealand and Australia businesses primarily driven by management s belief that the probability of a sale within   one   year is uncertain.  The Company s Asia Pacific businesses that have been sold to date, in the aggregate, are not considered a strategic shift; therefore, the Company no longer presents the Asia Pacific operations as discontinued operations in its financial statements for all periods presented. 
  The Company s first three fiscal quarters consist of 13-week periods ending on the Friday nearest to the end of the calendar months of March, June and September. The Company's fourth fiscal quarter consists of the first day following the third quarter through December 31. 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of wholly-owned subsidiaries and majority-owned controlled subsidiaries. The Company records its investment in each unconsolidated affiliated Company (generally   20-50   percent ownership in which it has the ability to exercise significant influence) at its respective equity in net assets. Other investments (generally less than   20   percent ownership) are recorded at cost. All intercompany transactions and balances among the consolidated companies have been eliminated. 
   Prior to   October 2, 2015  , the Company included the results of the Venezuelan operations in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements using the consolidation method of accounting. The Company s Venezuelan earnings and cash flows were reflected in the historical Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements using a combination of official exchange rates, including the SICAD 1, SICAD 2 and SIMADI rates. Evolving conditions in Venezuela, prior to the Company's sale of the business, including currency exchange regulations which reduced access to dollars through currency exchange markets and local market dynamics, resulted in an other-than-temporary lack of exchangeability between the Venezuelan bolivar and U.S. dollar, and restricted the Company's Venezuelan operations  ability to pay dividends and satisfy certain other obligations denominated in U.S. dollars.       Additionally, the existence of other governmental limitations restricted the Company's ability to control its Venezuelan operations.  For accounting purposes, this lack of exchangeability and governmental restrictions on operations resulted in a lack of control.  Therefore, in accordance with ASC 810, the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiary as of   October 2, 2015   and began accounting for the investment in the Venezuelan subsidiary using the cost method of accounting. Since   October 2, 2015  , and through the date of the sale, the Company's financial results did not include the operating results of its Venezuelan subsidiary and the carrying value of the cost method investment was   zero  .  
  On July 6, 2016, the Company completed the sale of its Venezuelan subsidiary, see Note 3 - Divestitures.

    Accounting Standards 
     The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the audited annual consolidated financial statements in the   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not change any of its existing accounting policies that are expected to have a significant effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  The following accounting pronouncements were adopted and became effective with respect to the Company in   2016  :  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  The update requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of being presented as an asset. Debt disclosures include the face amount of the debt liability and the effective interest rate. In August 2015, the FASB also issued ASU 2015-15, "Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements", which clarified the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with lines of credit. These costs may be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. The update requires retrospective application and represents a change in accounting principle. Debt issuance costs of   $1.5 million  , previously recorded to Prepaid expenses and other, and   $10.6 million  , previously recorded to Other non-current assets, are now presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of Long-term debt on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period." This standard provides more explicit guidance for treating share-based payment awards that require a specific performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition. The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  The following accounting pronouncements will become effective in future periods with respect to the Company: 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."  The update eliminates the current diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows by providing guidance on eight specific cash flow classification issues.  This update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."  The update is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements such as accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements and the classification of related amounts on the statement of cash flows.  This update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period for financial statements that have not been previously issued.  ASU 2016-09 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)."  The standard requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet.  A lessee should recognize in the balance sheet a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.  The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.  The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  This update provides guidance on simplifying the measurement of inventory. The current standard is to measure inventory at lower of cost or market; where market could be replacement cost, net realizable value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. ASU 2015-11 updates this guidance to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value; where net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable cost of completion, disposal, and transportation. This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period.  ASU 2015-11 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  This ASU outlines a single, comprehensive model for accounting for revenue from contracts with customers which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The standard permits the  
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective (cumulative effect) transition method. The Company has not selected a transition method and is evaluating the impact that the standard will have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)", which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 to annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early application permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company will adopt this standard on January 1, 2018. 
   
  3.      Divestitures 
  October 2014 Divestiture Plan 
    
  In October 2014, the Company announced the intent to divest all of the Company's operations in Asia Pacific and Africa.  The Company expects to incur approximately   $14 million   in pre-tax charges consisting primarily of legal and transaction fees for the dispositions. Charges incurred in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $1.6 million  .  Charges incurred in the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2015   were   $1.3 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively. 
  Asia Pacific 
  As part of the   October 2014   announcement, the Company completed the following as of   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    In the   first   quarter of   2016  , the Company completed the sale of General Cable Energy India Private Ltd. ("India") for gross proceeds of   $10.8 million  .  The pre-tax gain recognized in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from the disposition of India was   $1.6 million  . Based on the estimated expected sales price of the India operations, the Company recorded an impairment loss in cost of sales of   $13.6 million   in the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2015  .   
                
    In the   third   quarter of   2015  , the Company completed the sale of Phelps Dodge International Thailand ("Thailand") for cash consideration of approximately   $88 million  .  The pre-tax gain recognized in the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2015   from the disposition of Thailand was   $16.1 million  .  The pre-tax loss of Thailand for the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2015   was   $0.8 million   and   $7.6 million  , respectively.  The pre-tax loss attributable to the Company for the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2015   was   $0.6 million   and   $5.7 million  , respectively. 
                
    In the   first   quarter of   2015  , the Company completed the sale of its   51%   interest in Dominion Wire and Cables ("Fiji") and its   20%   interest in Keystone Electric Wire and Cable ("Keystone"), the Company's equity investment in China, for cash consideration of   $9.3 million   and   $11.0 million  , respectively. In the   nine months ended     October 2, 2015  , the pre-tax loss on the sale from the disposition of Fiji recognized was   $2.6 million   and the pre-tax gain from the disposition of Keystone recognized was   $3.6 million  . 
                
    In the   fourth   quarter of   2014  , the Company completed the sale of its interest in Phelps Dodge International Philippines, Inc. ( PDP ) and Phelps Dodge Philippines Energy Products Corporation ( PDEP ) for cash consideration of   $67.1 million  .   
     The results of the Asia Pacific operations were previously presented as discontinued operations; however, in the third quarter of 2016, management determined that the sale of these businesses within one year was uncertain, and therefore determined that the held for sale criteria was no longer met for the businesses in China, New Zealand and Australia (the "remaining Asia Pacific Operations").  As a result and because the businesses that have been sold to date including the Philippines, Thailand, India, Fiji and Keystone, in the aggregate, are not considered a strategic shift; the Asia Pacific operations will no longer be presented as discontinued operations in the financial statements for all periods presented.  The Company's results from the Asia Pacific operations are presented in continuing operations for all periods disclosed in this report. 
  The Company reclassified the remaining Asia Pacific operations' assets and liabilities previously presented as held for sale to held and used on its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015.  The remaining Asia Pacific operations are measured at the carrying amount before the assets were classified as held for sale, adjusted for depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held for use.  The adjustment in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is not material. 
  As of December 31, 2015, the Company's India assets met the held for sale criteria.  The assets were measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and depreciation ceased. Based on the estimated expected sales price of the India operations and in accordance with ASC 360  Property, Plant and Equipment , the Company recorded an impairment loss in cost of sales of   $13.6 million   in the three and nine months ended October 2, 2015.  At December 31, 2015, the assets and liabilities of India are not material.

Africa 
  The Company's Africa businesses, and disposals of related operations to date, are not considered a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results.  The Company has completed the following as of   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company completed the sale of Metal Fabricators of Zambia PLC ("Zambia") for cash consideration of   $9.8 million  .  In the second quarter of 2016, the Company recognized an estimated pre-tax loss of   $13.3 million  , and in the third quarter of 2016, after the completion of the sale, the Company recorded an additional loss of   $1.1 million   due to working capital adjustments.  The total loss recognized in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $14.4 million   and is included in the Selling, general and administrative ("SG A") expenses caption in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the Africa/Asia Pacific segment. The disposal loss was calculated using the Company's cumulative translation adjustment as part of the carrying amount of the investment.  
                
    In the   second   quarter of   2016  , the Company completed the sale of General Cable S.A.E. ("Egypt") for gross proceeds of   $5.8 million  .  The pre-tax loss recognized in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from the disposition of Egypt was   $8.4 million   and is included in the SG A expenses caption in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the Europe segment (based on the legal entity hierarchy).  
     As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that the remaining Africa businesses did not meet the held for sale criteria set forth in ASC 360, primarily driven by management s belief that the probability of a sale within   one   year is uncertain.  The disposal of the Company's Africa businesses is also not considered a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results; therefore, the results are presented as continued operations.  
  Venezuela Divestiture 
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company completed the sale of its Venezuelan subsidiary for cash consideration of approximately   $6 million  .  The pre-tax gain recognized in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $5.9 million  , and is included in the SG A expenses caption in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the Europe segment (based on the legal structure).

4.      Restructuring 
  November 2015 restructuring program 
  In the   fourth   quarter of   2015  , the Company committed to a new strategic roadmap targeting growth and improvement in market positions, improvement to its overall cost position, growth through innovation, enhancement of organizational capabilities, alignment of its organization structure and cultivation of a high-performance culture. This effort has been launched in a phased approach and is expected to continue over the next several years.  
  The Company expects to incur approximately   $60 million   in before-tax restructuring charges;   $46 million   in the North America segment ("North America"),   $11 million   in the Europe segment ("Europe") and   $3 million   in the Latin America segment ("Latin America").  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred charges of   $23.4 million   and   $39.8 million  , respectively.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , costs incurred were   $23.0 million   and   $35.3 million   in North America,   $0.1 million   and   $3.7 million   in Europe and   $0.3 million   and   $0.8 million   in Latin America, respectively.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $2.4 million   and   $8.7 million   of these charges were recorded in the Cost of sales caption and   $21.0 million   and   $31.1 million   were recorded in the SG A expenses caption in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss), respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , aggregate costs incurred were   $35.4 million   in North America,   $10.4 million   in Europe and   $2.6 million   in Latin America.  
  As part of the strategic roadmap, in the   second   quarter of   2016  , the Company completed the disposal of its North American Automotive Ignition Wire business for total consideration of   $70.7 million  . The pre-tax gain recognized in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $53.2 million  . The gain is recognized in the SG A expenses caption in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  This disposal did not represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results; therefore, the results are presented as continued operations.  
  Changes in the restructuring reserve and activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are below (in millions): 

Employee Separation Costs 
  The Company recorded employee separation costs of   $3.3 million   and   $5.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively.

8.      Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 
  Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed at least annually for impairment.  If the carrying amount of goodwill or an intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized in the amount equal to the excess. 
  The amounts of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were as follows (in millions): 

The amounts of other intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, were as follows (in millions): 

In the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $  7.4 million   and an impairment charge on the amortized intangible assets of $  4.7 million   related to the automotive business.

  Amortized intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Other intangible assets have been determined to have a useful life in the range of   7   to   12   years. The approximate weighted average useful life of the amortized intangible assets is   10   years. For customer relationships, the Company has accelerated the amortization expense to align with the historical customer attrition rates. All other amortized intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis. The amortization of intangible assets for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015   was   $6.7 million   and   $9.2 million  , respectively.

Revolving Credit Facility 
  On July 21, 2011, the Company entered into a   $400 million   Revolving Credit Facility, which was first amended in 2012 to increase the facility size to   $700 million   and then subsequently amended and restated on September 6, 2013 and further amended on October 22, 2013, May 20, 2014, September 23, 2014, October 28, 2014 and February 9, 2016, to, among other things, increase the Revolving Credit Facility to   $1.0 billion  ,   $630 million   of which may be borrowed by the U.S. borrower,   $300 million   of which may be borrowed by the European borrowers and   $70 million   of which may be borrowed by the Canadian borrower. The Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions including limitations on, among other things, distributions and dividends, acquisitions and investments, indebtedness, liens and affiliate transactions.  The Revolving Credit Facility provides the Company with flexibility and the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility generally only apply in the event that the Company's availability under the Revolving Credit Facility falls below certain specific thresholds. 
  The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of September 6, 2018.  The commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an additional   $250 million  , subject to certain conditions and approvals as set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility.  The Company capitalized an immaterial amount in   2016  ,   $0.6 million   in   2015   and   $1.7 million   in   2014   in deferred financing costs in connection with the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of   1.00   to   1.00   if availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less than the greater of   $100 million   or   10%   of the then existing aggregate lender commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is greater than   $100 million  . The fair value of the Revolving Credit Facility approximates the carrying value based on Level 2 inputs. 
  Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility is secured by: (a) for US borrowings under the facility, a first priority security interest in substantially all of our domestic assets and, (b) for Canadian and European borrowings under the facility, a first priority security interest in substantially all of our domestic and Canadian assets and certain assets of our Spanish, French and German subsidiaries party to the facility.   In addition, the lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility have received a pledge of (i)   100%   of the equity interests in all of the Company's domestic subsidiaries, and (ii)   65%   of the voting equity interests in and   100%   of the non-voting equity interests in certain of our foreign subsidiaries, including our Canadian subsidiaries and our Spanish, French and German subsidiaries party to the Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at interest rate bases elected by the Company plus an applicable margin calculated quarterly based on the Company's average

availability and Total Consolidated Leverage Ratio as set forth in the credit agreement. The Revolving Credit Facility also requires the payment of a commitment fee equal to the available but unused commitments multiplied by an applicable margin of either   0.25%   or   0.375%   based on the average daily unused commitments. 
  The Company s Revolving Credit Facility is summarized in the table below: 

(1) Total undrawn availability for the U.S. borrower, the Canadian borrower and the European borrowers at   September 30, 2016   is   $306.4 million  ,   $36.1 million   and   $51.2 million  , respectively.

    Financial Instruments 
     The Company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and raw material (commodity) prices. To manage risks associated with the volatility of these natural business exposures, the Company enters into interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivative agreements, and copper and aluminum forward pricing agreements. The Company does not purchase or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company does not engage in derivative contracts for which a lack of marketplace quotations would necessitate the use of fair value estimation techniques. 
  The Company enters into commodity instruments to hedge the purchase of copper, aluminum and lead in future periods and foreign currency exchange contracts principally to hedge the currency fluctuations in certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, thereby reducing the Company s risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. Principal transactions hedged during the year were firm sales and purchase commitments. The fair value of foreign currency contracts represents the amount required to enter into offsetting contracts with similar remaining maturities based on quoted market prices. 
  The Company accounts for these commodity instruments and foreign currency exchange contracts as economic hedges.  Changes in the fair value of economic hedges are recognized in current period earnings. 
  Fair Value of Derivatives Instruments 
  The notional amounts and fair values of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are shown below (in millions): 

(1) 
    Balance recorded in  Prepaid expenses and other  and  Other non-current assets  
              (2) 
    Balance recorded in  Accrued liabilities  and  Other liabilities  
       
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , all financial instruments held by the Company were subject to enforceable master netting arrangements held by various financial institutions. In general, the terms of our agreements provide that in the event of an early termination the counterparties have the right to offset amounts owed or owing under that and any other agreement with the same counterparty.  The Company's accounting policy is to not offset these positions in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the net positions of the enforceable master netting agreements are not significantly different from the gross positions noted in the table above. Depending on the extent of an unrealized loss position on a derivative contract held by the Company, certain counterparties may require collateral to secure the Company's derivative contract position. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   contracts held by the Company that required collateral to secure the Company's derivative liability positions. Refer to Note 5 - Other Income (Expense) for more information.

The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 was   44.8%   and   1.1%  , respectively.  The effective tax rate on the Company s pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was favorably impacted by the use of U.S. capital losses for which no tax benefit was previously recognized.  This resulted in the recognition of only   $2.4 million   of income tax expense on   $53.2 million   of pre-tax gain associated with the sale of the North American Automotive Ignition Wire business.  This favorable factor was largely offset by recognizing no tax benefit on   $44.2 million   of operational losses incurred in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are recorded against net deferred tax assets. 
  The relatively low effective tax rate on the Company s pre-tax loss for the nine months ended October 2, 2015 was primarily due to no tax benefit being available for the   $22.9 million   currency devaluation loss and foreign currency loss in Venezuela, no tax benefit being recognized on   $95.0 million   of operational losses incurred in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are recorded against net deferred tax assets, and no tax benefit being recognized on the   $12.0 million   Venezuelan deconsolidation loss.  These unfavorable factors were partially offset by   $5.4 million   of tax benefits associated with the net release of uncertain tax position reserves,   $4.3 million   of tax benefits associated with valuation allowance releases, and   $11.5 million   of tax benefits associated with tax deductions connected to the exiting of the business in India. 
  The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 was   28.9%   and   (19.9)%  , respectively.  The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was favorably impacted by the mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the   35%   U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the recognition of no income tax expense on   $5.9 million   of pre-tax gain associated with the sale of the Venezuelan business.  These favorable factors were partially offset by recognizing no tax benefit on   $20.6 million   of operational losses incurred in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are recorded against net deferred tax assets. 
  The negative effective tax rate for the three months ended October 2, 2015 is primarily the result of recording income tax expense on the ordinary operational income of profitable jurisdictions while recording no income tax benefit on   $34.3 million   of operational losses incurred in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are recorded against net deferred tax assets, and no income tax benefit on a   $12.0 million   Venezuela deconsolidation charge.  These negative effective tax rate drivers were partially offset by   $11.5 million   of tax benefits associated with the exiting of the business in India. 
  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company accrued approximately   $0.5 million   of income tax expense for uncertain tax positions likely to be taken in the current year and for interest and penalties on tax positions taken in prior periods, all of which would have a favorable impact on the effective tax rate, if recognized. In addition,   $0.1 million   of income tax benefits were recognized due to statute of limitation expirations associated with various uncertain tax positions. 
  The Company files income tax returns in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. Due to uncertainties regarding the timing and outcome of various tax audits, appeals and settlements, it is difficult to reliably estimate the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that could change within the next twelve months. The Company believes it is reasonably possible that approximately   $3 million   of unrecognized tax benefits could change within the next twelve months due to the resolution of tax audits and statute of limitations expiration. 
  The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") is currently in the process of finalizing its examination of the Company's 2012 consolidated income tax return.  As discussed in the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the IRS proposed a cumulative taxable income adjustment of   $33.6 million   through 2012 in connection with the Original Issue Discount ( OID ) yield on the Company s   $429.5 million   Subordinated Convertible Notes ( Notes ) due 2029. The Company believes that the amount of the OID deductions claimed on its federal income tax returns since the 2009 issuance of the Notes is proper and appealed the IRS proposed adjustment.  The appeals hearing took place on October 19, 2016 and the Company is currently awaiting the Office of Appeals ruling.  With limited exceptions, tax years prior to 2010 are no longer open in major foreign, state, or local tax jurisdictions.

    Employee Benefit Plans 
     The Company provides retirement benefits through contributory and noncontributory qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans covering eligible domestic and international employees as well as through defined contribution plans and other postretirement benefits. 
  The components of net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits were as follows (in millions):    

The estimated net loss for the defined benefit pension plans that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net pension expense in   2016   is   $8.4 million  . The prior service cost to be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into net pension expense over the next fiscal year is not material. 
  Defined benefit pension plan cash contributions for the   three   fiscal months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015   were   $1.3 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively. Defined benefit pension plan cash contributions for the   nine   fiscal months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015   were   $3.9 million   and   $9.0 million  , respectively.

14.       Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest 
  On October 1, 2012, the Company participated in a share subscription for   60%   of the outstanding and issued shares of Procables, the Company's subsidiary in Colombia.  The existing shareholders immediately prior to the subscription (the  Sellers  or  Minority Shareholders )  maintained control of the remaining   40%   of the shares.  The Company and the Minority Shareholders also agreed to certain put and call options with regard to the remaining   40%   interest in Procables retained by the Minority Shareholders.  For a   36  -month period commencing on the fourth anniversary of the closing date, the Minority Shareholders may exercise a put option to sell their entire   40%   interest in Procables to the Company. The Company shall be irrevocably obligated to purchase the shares (the "Put Option").  In addition, the Company has a call option (the "Call Option") to purchase the Minority Shareholders    40%   interest in Procables, during the   36  -month period commencing on the expiration of the Put Option period. The consideration to be exchanged, per share in the event of a Put Option or Call Option shall be the higher of the following (1) the final per share purchase price; or (2) a price per share based on the Company's enterprise value equal to seven times the average of its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) over the two most recently audited year-end financial statements immediately prior to the option being exercised, minus the 12-month average Net Indebtedness, as defined in the agreement, of the Company for the most recent audited fiscal year ( EBITDA average ).  The Company determined that the Put Option is embedded within the noncontrolling interest shares that are subject to the Put Option.  The redemption feature required classification of the Minority Shareholder's interest in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets outside of equity under the caption  Redeemable noncontrolling interest.  
  The redeemable noncontrolling interest of Procables was recorded on the acquisition date based on the estimated fair value of the shares including the embedded Put Option. The fair value of the Put Option was estimated at the higher of the final per share purchase price or EBITDA average.  At   September 30, 2016  , the final per share purchase price was greater than the EBITDA average; therefore, the redeemable noncontrolling interest was valued at the same cost as the fair value determined at the opening balance sheet date,   $18.2 million  .  Subsequent adjustments to the value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest due to the redemption feature, if any, will be recognized as they occur and recorded within Net income (loss).  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , the Minority Shareholders elected to exercise the Put Option to sell their entire   40%   interest in Procables to the Company.  The Put Option will be paid by the Company based on the final per share purchase price, and is expected to be approximately   $18 million  . 
   
  15.       Shipping and Handling Costs 
  All shipping and handling amounts billed to a customer in a sales transaction are classified as revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with storage and handling of finished goods and shipments to customers are included in the Cost of sales caption in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) and totaled   $28.4 million   and   $29.0 million  , respectively, for the   three   fiscal months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015   and   $87.9 million   and   $91.5 million  , respectively, for the   nine   fiscal months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  .

    Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share 
     The Company applies the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share.  
  A reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of earnings (loss) per common share-basic to earnings (loss) per common share-assuming dilution is as follows (in millions, except per share data): 

(1) 
    Numerator 
              (2) 
    Denominator 
              (3) 
    Under the two-class method, earnings (loss) per share   basic reflects undistributed earnings per share for both common stock and unvested share-based payment awards (restricted stock). 
       
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   4.0 million   shares and   1.8 million   shares and for the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2015  , there were approximately   3.7 million   shares excluded from the earnings per common share   assuming dilution computation because their impact was anti-dilutive, respectively. 
  Under ASC 260 - Earnings per Share and ASC 470 - Debt and because of the Company s obligation to settle the par value of the  Subordinated Convertible Notes in cash, the Company is not required to include any shares underlying the  Subordinated Convertible Notes in its weighted average shares outstanding   assuming dilution until the average stock price per share for the quarter exceeds the   $36.75   conversion price of the Subordinated Convertible Notes and only to the extent of the additional shares that the Company may be required to issue in the event that the Company s conversion obligation exceeds the principal amount of the Subordinated Convertible Notes.  The average stock price threshold conditions had not been met as of   September 30, 2016   or   October 2, 2015  . At any such time in the future that threshold conditions are met, only the number of shares issuable under the  treasury  method of accounting for the share dilution would be included in the Company s earnings per share   assuming dilution calculation, which is based upon the amount by which the average stock price exceeds the conversion price. 
  The following table provides examples of how changes in the Company s stock price would require the inclusion of additional shares in the denominator of the weighted average shares outstanding   assuming dilution calculation for the Subordinated Convertible Notes.

    Segment Information 
     The Company conducts its operations through   four   geographic operating and reportable segments   North America, Europe, Latin America, and Africa/Asia Pacific.  The Company s operating and reportable segments align with the structure of the Company s internal management organization.  All four segments engage in the development, design, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of copper, aluminum, and fiber optic communication, construction, electric utility and electrical infrastructure wire and cable products.  In addition to the above products, the North America and Latin America segments manufacture and distribute rod mill wire and cable products.  
  Net revenues as shown below represent sales to external customers for each segment.  Intersegment sales have been eliminated.  In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , intersegment sales were   $7.4 million   and   $31.1 million   in North America,   $3.5 million   and   $7.9 million   in Europe,   $4.7 million   and   $14.5 million   in Latin America and   $0.2 million   in Africa/Asia Pacific, respectively.  In the   three and nine   months ended   October 2, 2015  , intersegment sales were   $7.0 million   and   $24.8 million   in North America,   $2.1 million   and   $16.4 million   in Europe, and   $5.3 million   and   $14.8 million   in Latin America, respectively. 
  The chief operating decision maker ("CODM") evaluates segment performance and allocates resources based on segment operating income.  Segment operating income represents income before interest income, interest expense, other income (expense), other financial costs and income tax.  Summarized financial information for the Company s reportable segments for the   three and nine   fiscal months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015   is as follows:

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     Environmental matters  
  We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations covering the storage, handling, emission and discharge of materials into the environment, including CERCLA, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act (including the 1990 amendments) and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. 
  Our subsidiaries in the United States have been identified as potentially responsible parties with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under CERCLA or similar state laws, which impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages without regard to fault or the legality of waste generation or disposal. Persons liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites. Although CERCLA imposes joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties, in application, the potentially responsible parties typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon, among other things, the volume of waste contributed by each potentially responsible party. 
  Settlements can often be achieved through negotiations with the appropriate environmental agency or the other potentially responsible parties. Potentially responsible parties that contributed small amounts of waste (typically less than 1% of the waste) are often given the opportunity to settle as  de minimus  parties, resolving their liability for a particular site. We do not own or operate any of the waste sites with respect to which we have been named as a potentially responsible party by the government. Based on our review and other factors, we believe that costs relating to environmental clean-up at these sites will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows or financial position.   
  On March 7, 2011, GK Technologies, Inc. ( GK Tech ) was served with a Complaint filed on February 24, 2011, by the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles ( HACLA ) arising under CERCLA, California statutory law, and common law in the case known as Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles v. PCC Technical Industries, Inc., Case No. 11-CV-01626 FMO (C.D. Cal.).  The Housing Authority contends that GK Tech and several other defendants are responsible for environmental contamination at property located at 9901 S. Alameda Street in Los Angeles (the  Site ), which was apparently the location of a steel recycling mill formerly operated by a former subsidiary of GK Tech.  The former subsidiary was legally dissolved in September 1993.   
  GK Tech has asserted various defenses to the claim, including the dissolution of the former subsidiary and the lack of knowledge of the environmental contamination.  The Court had previously determined, as a matter of law, that the former subsidiary is one of several potentially responsible parties ( PRPs ) liable under CERCLA for costs of remediation of the contamination at the Site.   
  HACLA began conducting remediation work at the Site in April 2015, with projected costs at the time ranging from   $5 million   to   $13 million  .  In   October 2015  , HACLA substantially expanded the scope of the remediation work at the Site and now estimates that the total costs to complete the work are between   $21 million   and   $30 million  .  HACLA has collected some amounts through prior settlements with parties that owned and/or conducted operations on the Site after March 1979, which amounts we believe would partially offset any possible liability of GK Tech. GK Tech believes that it has very good defenses to HACLA s successor liability theories but, nevertheless, it is reasonably possible that GK Tech could be held liable for between   $0 million   and   $30 million   in this case. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had an accrued liability of approximately   $4.6 million   and   $3.6 million  , respectively, for various environmental-related liabilities to the extent costs are known or can be reasonably estimated as a liability.  While it is difficult to estimate future environmental-related liabilities accurately, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows as a result of compliance with federal, state, local or foreign environmental laws or regulations or cleanup costs of the sites discussed above.  
  Asbestos litigation 
  We have been a defendant in asbestos litigation for the past   28   years. Our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in lawsuits alleging exposure to asbestos in products manufactured by us.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were a defendant in approximately   322   cases brought in state and federal courts throughout the United States.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   65   asbestos cases were brought against us.  In the calendar year   2015  ,   99   asbestos cases were brought against us.  In the last   28   years, we have had   no   cases proceed to verdict.  In many of the cases, we were dismissed as a defendant before trial for lack of product identification.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   50,942   asbestos cases have been dismissed.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   67   asbestos cases were dismissed.  As of   December 31, 2015  ,   50,875   cases were dismissed.  With regards to the approximately   322   remaining pending cases, we are aggressively defending these cases based upon either lack of product identification as to whether we manufactured asbestos-containing product and/or lack of exposure to asbestos dust from the use of our product. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , plaintiffs have asserted monetary damages in   165   cases.  In   56   of these cases, plaintiffs allege only damages in excess of some dollar amount (about   $681 thousand   per plaintiff); in these cases there are no claims for specific dollar amounts requested as to any defendant.  In   108   other cases pending in state and federal district courts, plaintiffs seek approximately   $430 million   in damages from as many as   50   defendants.  In   one   case, plaintiffs have asserted damages related to General Cable  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

in the amount of   $4 million  .  In addition, in relation to these   165   cases, there are claims of   $270 million   in punitive damages from all of the defendants.  However, many of the plaintiffs in these cases allege non-malignant injuries.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had accrued, on a gross basis, approximately   $4.3 million   and   $4.1 million  , respectively, and as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , had recovered approximately   $0.4 million   of insurance recoveries for these lawsuits.  The net amount of   $3.9 million   and   $3.7 million  , as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, represents our best estimate in order to cover resolution of current asbestos-related claims.   
  The components of the asbestos litigation reserve are current and future asbestos-related claims. The significant assumptions are: (1) the number of cases per state, (2) an estimate of the judgment per case per state, (3) an estimate of the percentage of cases per state that would make it to trial and (4) the estimated total liability percentage, excluding insurance recoveries, per case judgment. Management's estimates are based on the Company's historical experience with asbestos related claims. The Company's current history of asbestos claims does not provide sufficient and reasonable information to estimate a range of loss for potential future, unasserted asbestos claims because the number and the value of the alleged damages of such claims have not been consistent. As such, the Company does not believe a reasonably possible range can be estimated with respect to asbestos claims that may be filed in the future.  
  Settlement payments are made, and the asbestos accrual is relieved, when we receive a fully executed settlement release from the plaintiff's counsel.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , aggregate settlement costs were   $9.8 million   and   $9.7 million  , respectively.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , settlement costs totaled less than   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , aggregate litigation costs were   $26.9 million   and   $26.1 million  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , litigation costs were   $0.8 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. 
  In January 1994, we entered into a settlement agreement with certain principal primary insurers concerning liability for the costs of defense, judgments and settlements, if any, in all of the asbestos litigation described above. Subject to the terms and conditions of the settlement agreement, the insurers were responsible for a substantial portion of the costs and expenses incurred in the defense or resolution of this litigation.  However, one of the insurers participating in the settlement that was responsible for a significant portion of the contribution under the settlement agreement entered into insurance liquidation proceedings and another became insolvent. As a result, the contribution of the insurers has been reduced and we have had to bear substantially most of the costs relating to these lawsuits.  
  European Commission competition matter 
  As part of the Company s acquisition of Silec in December 2005, SAFRAN SA ( SAFRAN ), agreed to indemnify the Company for the full amount of losses arising from, related to or attributable to practices, if any, that are similar to previous practices investigated by the French competition authority for alleged competition law violations related to medium-and high voltage cable markets. The Company has asserted a claim under this indemnity against SAFRAN related to the European Commission s Statement of Objections, discussed below, to preserve the Company s rights in case of an adverse European Commission decision. 
  On July 5, 2011, the European Commission issued a Statement of Objections in relation to its ongoing competition investigation to a number of wire and cable manufacturers in the submarine and underground power cables business, including our Spanish affiliate, Grupo General Cable Sistemas, and its French subsidiary, Silec. The Statement of Objections alleged that the   two   affiliates engaged in violations of competition law in the underground power cables businesses for limited periods of time. The allegations related to Grupo General Cable Sistemas claimed that it had participated in a cartel from January 2003 to May 2007, while the allegations related to Silec were for the   ten   month period following its December 22, 2005 acquisition from SAFRAN by Grupo General Cable Sistemas. 
  Following our formal responses to the Statement of Objections in October 2011 and a hearing in 2012, the European Commission issued a final decision on April 2, 2014. In the decision, the claims of infringement against Grupo General Cable Sistemas were dismissed for lack of evidence of alleged cartel activity. With regard to Silec, the European Commission s decision imposed a fine of   1.9 million   Euros related to the period Silec has been owned by us. This fine was based on participation that allegedly commenced well before Silec was acquired by us. On June 13, 2014, we filed an appeal with the General Court of the European Union challenging the European Commission s decision as to Silec in Europe based on established precedent.  We also continue to pursue our claim for full indemnification for the Silec fine under the terms of the acquisition agreement with SAFRAN executed in 2005. 
  Transformer damage claims 
  In March 2012, we received formal notice of a claim for damages arising from a transformer fire that occurred in December 2010 allegedly resulting in loss of equipment and some consequential damages at a metal processing facility in Iceland.  We supplied and installed cables and terminations to the transformer, which was manufactured and installed by an independent third party, during 2006 and the first quarter of 2007.  Our work was inspected and accepted by the customer in March 2007.  In August 2012, the customer initiated arbitration proceedings before the ICC Tribunal with a request to arbitrate in Pennsylvania.  In September 2012, we initiated litigation in Pennsylvania state court seeking a declaration that we are not liable for any damages associated  
  
   28 

     Table of Contents  

with the alleged loss resulting from the transformer fire and seeking to enjoin the ICC arbitration proceedings. The customer then moved the case from state to federal district court in the Western District of Pennsylvania which determined on motion that the ICC Tribunal not the court should decide whether the claims were arbitrable in the first instance. The arbitration was conducted before the ICC Tribunal in April 2015, and the parties filed post-hearing briefs. On   March 24, 2016  , the ICC Tribunal issued its final order finding the Company liable for   $15.7 million   in damages plus prejudgment interest of   $3.5 million  .  The Company was fully insured for the   $19.2 million   award.  Payment from the insurers was made in the   second   quarter of   2016  .   
  Brazil tax matters 
  One of our Brazilian subsidiaries is involved in administrative proceedings with State treasury offices regarding whether tax incentives granted to us by one Brazilian state are applicable to goods sold in another Brazilian State. We believe we correctly relied on the tax incentives granted and that we have substantial defenses to their disallowance by the Brazilian State claimant.  The total amount of taxes allegedly due for the infractions including potential interest and penalties is up to   $8 million  .  In September 2012, an Administrative Court found that we were not liable for any incentive tax payments claimed by the State treasury office, however this determination was overturned on appeal and has since been further appealed.  This appeal remains pending at the Brazilian Courts.  Despite the pending appeal, in October 2014, the State issued a summons to recover the approximately   $8 million   of contested incentives described above, and we are complying with the terms of the State s summons while continuing to contest the Court s ruling. We currently estimate our range of reasonably possible loss to be between   $0 million   and   $8 million  . 
  Our Brazilian subsidiaries have received notifications of various other claims related to disputed tax credits taken on Federal Tax Offset returns, which are in various phases of litigation. We believe we correctly applied the tax credits taken and that we have substantial defenses to these claims. The total amount of taxes allegedly due for the disputed credits, including potential interest and penalties, is up to   $12 million  . 
  Government and internal investigations  
  We have been reviewing, with the assistance of external counsel, our use and payment of agents in connection with, and certain other transactions involving, our operations in Angola, Thailand, India, China and Egypt (the  Subject Countries ). Our review has focused upon payments and gifts made, offered, contemplated or promised by certain employees in one or more of the Subject Countries, directly and indirectly, and at various times, to employees of public utility companies and/or other officials of state owned entities that raise concerns under the FCPA and possibly under the laws of other jurisdictions. During 2015, we substantially completed our internal review in the Subject Countries and, based on our findings, we increased our outstanding FCPA-related accrual to   $28 million   in the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  We subsequently entered into and have continued to hold discussions with the SEC and DOJ regarding the terms of a potential resolution of the ongoing investigations.  Based on these discussions, we now believe that the total amount required to resolve the investigation, including disgorgement of profits, pre-judgment interest, and potential fines and penalties is in the range of   $33 million   to approximately   $120 million  .  The existing accrual as of   September 30, 2016   remains   $33 million  , which represents the low-end of the range and an increase of   $5 million   since   December 31, 2015  .  The amount accrued and the additional range of reasonably possible loss reflect profits and pre-judgment interest that may be disgorged and DOJ fines or penalties that may be imposed, but do not include, and we are not able to reasonably estimate, the amount of any additional possible fines, civil penalties or other relief that may be sought with respect to the SEC FCPA investigation or the SEC accounting investigation described below, any or all of which could be substantial. The SEC and DOJ inquiries into these matters remain ongoing, and we continue to cooperate with the DOJ and the SEC with respect to these matters. At this time, we are unable to predict the nature or duration of any action that may be taken by the DOJ or SEC or any remedies these agencies may pursue as a result of such actions, in the event that we do not reach to a mutually agreeable resolution with the DOJ and SEC. 
  As previously disclosed, we conducted internal investigations, subject to the oversight of the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors and with the assistance of external counsel, principally relating to matters resulting in restatements of a number of our previously issued financial statements. The matters addressed in the investigations included (i) inventory accounting errors addressed in the restatements, including those resulting from inventory theft in Brazil, as well as the timing of internal reporting of the inventory accounting issues to senior corporate management at our headquarters in Highland Heights, Kentucky and (ii) historical revenue recognition accounting practices with regard to  bill and hold  sales in Brazil related to aerial transmission projects, including instances where we determined that the requirements for revenue recognition under GAAP with respect to the bill and hold sales were not met. ( Bill and hold  sales generally are sales meeting specified criteria under GAAP that enable the seller to recognize revenue at the time title to goods and ownership risk is transferred to the customer, even though the seller does not ship the goods until a later time. In typical sales transactions other than those accounted for as bill and hold, title to goods and ownership risk is transferred to the customer at the time of shipment or delivery.) In connection with these matters, among others, our management identified control deficiencies that constituted material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses resulted in accounting errors that caused us to issue two sets of restated financial statements. In March 2013, principally to correct the inventory accounting errors, we issued restated consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and unaudited restated financial statements for interim periods in 2011 and interim periods ended on March 30, 2012 and June 29, 2012. In January 2014, principally to correct

     Table of Contents  

errors relating to revenue recognition with respect to the bill and hold sales, we issued restated consolidated financial statements (which also encompassed matters addressed in the earlier restatement) as of December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, 2010 and 2009, and unaudited restated financial statements for interim periods in 2011 and 2012 and the interim period ended on March 29, 2013. 
  We voluntarily contacted the SEC to advise it of our initial internal investigation, and we have continued to provide information to the SEC on an ongoing basis, including, among other things, information regarding the matters described above and certain earnings management activities by employees prior to the end of 2012. As we previously disclosed, these earnings management activities (none of which identified to date had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements) were designed to delay the reporting of expenses or other charges, including improper capitalization of costs, misuse of accruals and failure to timely report inventory shortfalls identified through physical inventory counts. The SEC has issued a formal order of investigation. Pursuant to the formal order, the SEC issued subpoenas to us seeking relevant documents and to certain of our current and former employees seeking their testimony. The SEC has requested information regarding, among other things, the above-described Angola matter, matters that were subject to our internal investigations and earnings management activities by employees. We continue to cooperate with the SEC in connection with its investigation.  
  Any determination that our operations or activities are not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, civil and criminal penalties, and equitable remedies, including disgorgement and injunctive relief.  
  Purported class action and derivative litigation  
  Litigation was initiated against us and certain of our current and former directors, executive officers and employees following the restating of our financial statements, principally as a result of the matters described above under  Government and internal investigations  relating to our Brazilian business. 
  Two   civil complaints were filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on October 21, 2013 and December 4, 2013 by named plaintiffs, on behalf of purported classes of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired our publicly traded securities, against us, Gregory Kenny, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, and Brian Robinson, our former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. On our motion, the complaints were transferred to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, the actions were consolidated, and a consolidated complaint was filed in that Court on May 20, 2014 by City of Livonia Employees Retirement System, as lead plaintiff on behalf of a purported class of all persons or entities who purchased our securities between November 3, 2010 and October 14, 2013 (the  City of Livonia Complaint ). The City of Livonia Complaint alleged claims under the antifraud and controlling person liability provisions of the Exchange Act, alleging generally, among other assertions, that we employed inadequate internal financial reporting controls that resulted in, among other things, improper revenue recognition, understated cost of sales, overstated operating income, net income and earnings per share, and the failure to detect inventory lost through theft; that we issued materially false financial results that had to be restated on two occasions; and that statements of Messrs. Kenny and Robinson that they had tested and found effective our internal controls over financial reporting and disclosure were false. The City of Livonia Complaint alleged that as a result of the foregoing, our stock price was artificially inflated and the plaintiffs suffered damages in connection with their purchase of our stock.  The City of Livonia Complaint sought damages in an unspecified amount; reasonable costs and expenses, including counsel and experts fees; and such equitable injunctive or other relief as the Court deems just and proper. On January 27, 2015, the Court dismissed the City of Livonia Complaint, with prejudice, based on plaintiff s failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Plaintiff subsequently appealed the lower Court s decisions to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which affirmed the lower Court s decisions dismissing the case.  The period of time available to plaintiff to further appeal the Sixth Circuit s decision has now expired, and the case is closed. 
  In addition, a derivative complaint was filed on January 7, 2014 in the Campbell County, Kentucky Circuit Court against all but one member of our Board of Directors, including Mr. Kenny, two former directors, Mr. Robinson and two former officers, one of whom is a former executive officer. The derivative complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by knowingly failing to ensure that we implemented and maintained adequate internal controls over our accounting and financial reporting functions and by knowingly disseminating to stockholders materially false and misleading statements concerning our financial results and internal controls. The derivative complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount, appropriate equitable relief to remedy the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, attorneys  fees, experts  fees and other costs. On March 5, 2014, the derivative case was placed on inactive status until a motion is filed by a party to reinstate the action to the Court s active docket.   On July 27, 2016, plaintiff filed a Notice of Dismissal with the Court, voluntarily terminating the derivative litigation. 
  Other 
  In addition, we are involved in various routine legal proceedings and administrative actions incidental to our business. In the opinion of our management, these routine proceedings and actions should not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters or other similar matters, if unfavorable, may have such adverse effects.

In accordance with GAAP, we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. These provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. To the extent additional information arises or our strategies change, it is possible that our estimate of our probable liability in these matters may change.  
  The General Cable Executive Severance Benefit Plan ( Severance Plan ), effective January 1, 2008, applicable to our U.S. executives holding a position of Executive Vice President or above prior to August 1, 2014, and the 2014 Executive Officer Severance Plan ("2014 Severance Plan"), applicable to the Company s executive officers holding a position of Executive Vice President or above or the position of Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Chief Compliance Officer or Chief Human Resources Officer and were hired or first promoted into such position after August 1, 2014, each include a change in control provision such that the executives may receive payments or benefits in accordance with the Severance Plan or 2014 Severance Plan, as applicable,  to the extent that both a change of control and a triggering event, each as defined in the Severance Plan, occur. Unless there are circumstances of ineligibility, as defined, the Company must provide payments and benefits upon both a change in control and a triggering event. 
  The Company has entered into various operating lease agreements related principally to certain administrative, manufacturing and distribution facilities and transportation equipment. At   September 30, 2016  , future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable lease agreements during the   twelve   month periods beginning   September 30, 2016   through   October 1, 2021   and thereafter are   $17.9 million  ,   $11.3 million  ,   $8.0 million  ,   $6.2 million   and   $5.1 million  , respectively, and   $12.7 million   thereafter. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $22.3 million   in letters of credit,   $223.8 million   in various performance bonds and   $77.0 million   in other guarantees. Other guarantees include bank guarantees and advance payment bonds. These letters of credit, performance bonds and guarantees are periodically renewed and are generally related to risk associated with self-insurance claims, defined benefit plan obligations, contract performance, quality and other various bank and financing guarantees. Advance payment bonds are often required by customers when the Company obtains advance payments to secure the production of cable for long-term contracts. The advance payment bonds provide the customer protection on their deposit in the event that the Company does not perform under the contract.  
   
           19.  
    Unconsolidated Affiliated Companies 
     Unconsolidated affiliated companies are those in which the Company generally owns less than   50 percent   of the outstanding voting shares.  The Company does not control these companies and accounts for its investments in them on the equity method basis.  The unconsolidated affiliated companies primarily manufacture or market wire and cable products in the Latin America and Africa/Asia Pacific segments. The Company s share of the income of these companies is reported in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) under  Equity in net earnings of affiliated companies.   For the   three   fiscal months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , equity in net earnings of affiliated companies was   $0.3 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively.  For the   nine   fiscal months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , equity in net earnings of affiliated companies was   $0.7 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively.  The net investment in unconsolidated affiliated companies was   $9.1 million   and   $8.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s ownership percentage was as follows: Colada Continua Chilena, S.A.   41%  , Nostag GmbH   Co. KG   33%  , and Pakistan Cables Limited   24.6%  .

20.       Fair Value Disclosure 
  The fair market values of the Company s financial instruments are determined based on the fair value hierarchy as discussed in ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurements. 
  The Company carries derivative assets and liabilities (Level 2) and marketable equity securities (Level 1) held in the rabbi trust as part of the Company s Deferred Compensation Plan at fair value. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the over-the-counter market are determined using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate pricing and volatility factors, which are used to value the position. The predominance of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value, which are based on quoted market prices. 
  Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below (in millions). 

(1) Balance represents the market value of the assets, exclusive of the market value of restricted stock and restricted stock units held ("Deferred Stock") and the General Cable Stock Fund by participants  elections, held in the Rabbi Trust in connection with the Company's deferred compensation plan at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   classified as  other non-current assets  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The market value of mutual fund investments and the General Cable Stock Fund in the Rabbi Trust was   $16.2 million   and   $25.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Amounts payable to the plan participants at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , excluding the Deferred Stock, were   $11.4 million   and   $19.0 million  , respectively, and are classified as  Other liabilities  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were no material financial assets or financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).  Similarly, there were no other nonfinancial assets or nonfinancial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.

Intercompany Activity 
  The Parent Company and its Guarantor Subsidiaries participate in a cash pooling program. As part of this program, cash balances are generally swept on a daily basis between the Guarantor Subsidiaries  bank accounts and those of the Parent Company. There are a significant number of the Company s subsidiaries that participate in this cash pooling arrangement and there are thousands of transactions per week that occur between the Parent Company and Guarantor Subsidiaries, all of which are accounted for through the intercompany accounts. 
  Parent Company transactions include interest, dividends, tax payments and intercompany sales transactions related to administrative costs incurred by the Parent Company, which are billed to Guarantor Subsidiaries on a cost-plus basis. These costs are reported in the Parent s SG A expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) Information for the respective period(s). All intercompany transactions are presumed to be settled in cash when they occur and are included in operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  Non-operating cash flow changes are classified as financing activities.

  Overview 
  The Company is a global leader in the development, design, manufacture, marketing and distribution of copper, aluminum and fiber optic wire and cable products for use in the energy, industrial, construction, specialty and communications markets. The Company additionally engages in the design, integration, and installation on a turn-key basis for products such as high and extra-high voltage terrestrial and submarine systems. The Company analyzes its worldwide operations based on four geographical segments: North America, Europe, Latin America, and Africa/Asia Pacific. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company manufactured its product lines in   38   manufacturing facilities and sold its products through its global operations. Additional financial information regarding the Company's segments appears in Note 17 - Segment Information. The Company's guiding principles are as follows:  
  
   42 

     Table of Contents  

Implementing the Company's new strategy to deliver increased operating income margins and returns from the Company's core strategic operations in North America, Latin America and Europe by leveraging economies of scale and capitalizing on the Company's leading positions across key markets where the Company has built long-standing customer relationships, efficient supply chains and a wide range of product offerings; 
                
    Simplifying the geographic portfolio and reducing operational complexity by continuing on a strategy to exit its operations in Africa and Asia Pacific; 
                
    Aligning organization structure to capitalize on the Company's leading market positions to benefit from key end markets, such as electric utility and communications; 
                
    Strengthening and expanding customer relationships by providing high quality product lines and customer service;  
                
    Continuing to increase cash flow through operational excellence by leveraging the Company's operating systems, logistical expertise, Lean Six Sigma manufacturing tools and techniques to improve the Company's cost position to increase margins as well as delivering improved returns through restructuring initiatives; 
                
    Managing the Company's product portfolio by pursuing market share in faster growing and value added product lines; 
                
    Enhancing organization capabilities by leveraging the Company's diversity and intellectual property through the sharing of best practices across the organization; and 
                
    Cultivating a high performance culture with focus on operational execution, compliance, sustainability, safety, and innovation. 
     By operating under these guiding principles, the Company has been able to build a strong market position in the areas in which it competes.  The Company considers its key performance indicators to be volume, as measured in metal pounds sold, operating income, net income, adjusted operating income, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), earnings per share, operating cash flows, the cash conversion cycle, returns on capital employed and invested capital and working capital efficiency. 
  Significant Current Business Trends and Events 
  The wire and cable industry is competitive, mature and cost driven with minimal differentiation for many product offerings among industry participants from a manufacturing or technology standpoint.  Over the last several years, the Company and the industry have experienced uneven demand with pockets of relative demand strength. In certain markets, however, global demand remains below historical levels.  The following are significant trends and events that affected the financial results in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Effect of copper and aluminum prices     
  The Company s reported (GAAP) results are directly influenced by the price of copper, and to a lesser extent, aluminum. The price of copper and aluminum as traded on the London Metal Exchange ( LME ) and Commodity Exchange, Inc. ("COMEX") has historically been subject to considerable volatility.  The Company continues to experience volatile commodity pricing, primarily copper and aluminum, as well as other cost inputs.  Volatility in the price of copper and aluminum and other raw materials, as well as fuel and energy, may in turn lead to significant fluctuations in our cost of sales or revenues.  A significant portion of the Company's electric utility and telecommunications business and, to a lesser extent, the Company's electrical infrastructure business has metal escalators and de-escalators included in customer contracts under a variety of price setting and recovery formulas.  The remainder of the Company's business requires that volatility in the cost of metals be recovered through negotiated price changes with customers.  In these instances, the ability to change the Company's selling prices may lag the movement in metal prices by a period of time as the customer price changes are implemented.  
  Therefore, in the short-term, during periods of escalating raw material cost inputs, to the extent the Company is able to increase prices in the market to recover the higher raw material costs, the Company will generally experience an increase in gross profit from the sale of its relatively lower value inventory as computed under the weighted average inventory costing method.  If the Company is unable to increase prices with the rise in the raw material market prices due to low levels of demand or market dynamics, the Company will experience lower gross profit.  Conversely, during periods of declining raw material cost inputs, to the extent the Company has to decrease prices in the market due to competitive pressure as the current cost of metals declines, the Company will generally experience downward pressure on its gross profit due to the sale of relatively higher value inventory as computed under the weighted average inventory costing method.  If the Company is able to maintain price levels in an environment in which raw material prices are declining due to high levels of demand, the Company will experience higher gross profit.  There is no exact future measure of the effect to the Company's profitability of the change of raw material cost inputs due to the unique set of selling variables and the high volume of transactions in any given period, each of which involves numerous individual pricing decisions.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , a   1%   change in copper and aluminum costs would have impacted the cost of sales by approximately   $12 million  .  This impact would directly impact gross profit if the Company was unable to change the price of copper and aluminum.  To help reduce this volatility, the Company has implemented various pricing mechanisms and hedges a portion of its metal purchases when there is a firm price commitment for a future delivery, but the Company does not engage in speculative metals trading.

  As part of the 2014 announced divestiture plan, the Company completed the following transactions as of   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    In the   first   quarter of   2016  , the Company completed the sale of India for cash consideration of   $10.8 million  .  The pre-tax gain recognized in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from the disposition of India was   $1.6 million  .  Based on the estimated expected sales price of the India operations, the Company recorded an impairment loss in cost of sales of   $13.6 million   in the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2015  .  
                
    In the   third   quarter of   2015  , the Company completed the sale of Thailand for cash consideration of approximately   $88 million  .  The pre-tax gain recognized in the   three and nine months ended     October 2, 2015   from the disposition of Thailand was   $16.1 million  .  
                
    In the   first   quarter of   2015  , the Company completed the sale of its   51%   interest in Fiji and its   20%   interest in Keystone, (the Company's equity investment in China) for cash consideration of   $9.3 million   and   $11.0 million  , respectively. In the   nine months ended     October 2, 2015  , the pre-tax loss on the sale from the disposition of Fiji recognized was   $2.6 million   and the pre-tax gain from the disposition of Keystone recognized was   $3.6 million  . 
                
    In the   fourth   quarter of   2014  , the Company completed the sale of its interest in PDP and PDEP for cash consideration of   $67.1 million  .  
     The results of the Asia Pacific operations were previously presented as discontinued operations; however, in the third quarter of 2016, management determined that the sale of these businesses within one year was uncertain, and therefore determined that the held for sale criteria was no longer met for the businesses in China, New Zealand and Australia.  As a result and because the businesses that have been sold to date including the Philippines, Thailand, India, Fiji and Keystone, in the aggregate, are not considered a strategic shift; the Asia Pacific operations will no longer be presented as discontinued operations in the financial statements for all periods presented.  The Company's results from the Asia Pacific operations are presented in continuing operations for all periods disclosed in this report.  Refer to Note 3 - Divestitures for additional information. 
  Africa divestiture program 
  As part of the   2014   announced divestiture plan, the Company completed the following transactions as of   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company completed the sale of Zambia for cash consideration of   $9.8 million  .

The disposal loss was calculated using the Company's cumulative translation adjustment as part of the carrying amount of the investment.  
     The disposal of the Company's Africa businesses is not considered a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results; therefore, the results are presented as continued operations.  
  Restructuring activities 
  In the   fourth   quarter of   2015  , the Company committed to a new strategic roadmap targeting growth and improvement in market positions, improvement to its overall cost position, growth through innovation, enhancement of organization capabilities, alignment of its organization structure and cultivation of a high-performance culture. This effort will be launched in a phased approach and is expected to continue over the next several years.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred total costs of   $23.4 million   and   $39.8 million  , including   $23.0 million   and   $35.3 million   in North America,   $0.1 million   and   $3.7 million   in Europe and   $0.3 million   and   $0.8 million   in Latin America, respectively. These actions resulted in the elimination of approximately   310   positions globally. The Company anticipates these actions will result in savings of approximately   $100 million   annually beginning in   2018  . 
  In July 2014, the Company announced that it was implementing a restructuring program. As of   September 30, 2016  , the program is substantially complete. The restructuring program generated approximately   $27 million   of savings in the first   nine   months of   2016  , and is expected to generate ongoing annual savings of approximately   $80 million   to   $100 million  . For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred charges of   $0.8 million   and   $10.6 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , costs incurred were   $0.1 million   and   $6.2 million   in North America,   $0.2 million

and   $2.0 million   in Europe and   $0.5 million   and   $2.4 million   in Latin America, respectively. These actions resulted in the elimination of approximately   1,430   positions globally. 
  North America automotive ignition wire sale 
  As part of the November 2015 strategic roadmap, in the   second   quarter of   2016  , the Company completed the disposal of its North American Automotive Ignition Wire business for total consideration of   $70.7 million  . The pre-tax gain recognized in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from the disposition of the Automotive Ignition Wire business was   $53.2 million  . The gain is recognized in the SG A expenses caption in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss).  This disposal did not represent a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results; therefore, the results are presented as continued operations.  
  Events affecting Venezuelan Operations  
  In the   third   quarter of   2016  , the Company completed the sale of its Venezuelan subsidiary for cash consideration of approximately   $6 million  .  The pre-tax gain recognized in the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $5.9 million  , and is included in the SG A expenses caption in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income (Loss) in the Europe segment (based on the legal structure).  
  Effective   October 2, 2015  , the Company deconsolidated its Venezuelan subsidiary and began accounting for its investment in the Venezuelan subsidiary using the cost method of accounting.  Beginning in the   fourth   quarter of   2015  , the Company's financial results only included U.S. dollar payments received from its Venezuelan subsidiary.  Refer to Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation for further details. 
  FCPA Matters 
  We have been reviewing, with the assistance of external counsel, our use and payment of agents in connection with, and certain other transactions involving, our operations in Angola, Thailand, India, China and Egypt (the  Subject Countries ). Our review has focused upon payments and gifts made, offered, contemplated or promised by certain employees in one or more of the Subject Countries, directly and indirectly, and at various times, to employees of public utility companies and/or other officials of state owned entities that raise concerns under the FCPA and possibly under the laws of other jurisdictions. During 2015, we substantially completed our internal review in the Subject Countries and, based on our findings, we increased our outstanding FCPA-related accrual to   $28 million   in the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  We subsequently entered into and have continued to hold discussions with the SEC and DOJ regarding the terms of a potential resolution of the ongoing investigations.  Based on these discussions, we now believe that the total amount required to resolve the investigation, including disgorgement of profits, pre-judgment interest, and potential fines and penalties is in the range of   $33 million   to approximately   $120 million  .  The existing accrual as of   September 30, 2016   remains   $33 million  , which represents the low-end of the range and an increase of   $5 million   since   December 31, 2015  .  The amount accrued and the additional range of reasonably possible loss reflect profits and pre-judgment interest that may be disgorged and DOJ fines or penalties that may be imposed, but do not include, and we are not able to reasonably estimate, the amount of any additional possible fines, civil penalties or other relief that may be sought with respect to the SEC FCPA investigation or the SEC accounting investigation described below, any or all of which could be substantial. The SEC and DOJ inquiries into these matters remain ongoing, and we continue to cooperate with the DOJ and the SEC with respect to these matters. At this time, we are unable to predict the nature or duration of any action that may be taken by the DOJ or SEC or any remedies these agencies may pursue as a result of such actions, in the event that we do not reach to a mutually agreeable resolution with the DOJ and SEC. 
  Seasonality 
  The Company generally has experienced and expects to continue to experience certain seasonal trends in many products in which demand is linked with construction spending. Demand for these products during winter months in certain geographies is usually lower than demand during spring and summer months. Therefore, larger amounts of working capital are generally required during winter months in order to build inventories in anticipation of higher demand during the spring and summer months, when construction activity increases. In turn, receivables related to higher sales activity during the spring and summer months are generally collected during the fourth quarter of the year. Additionally, the Company has historically experienced changes in demand resulting from poor or unusual weather.   
  Other Trends 
  In addition to the factors previously mentioned, the Company is currently being affected by the following general macro-level trends: 
             
    Global demand and pricing are uneven as a result of macroeconomic factors, and therefore, continues to  hamper growth in key end markets; 
                
    Currency volatility and continued political uncertainty in certain markets;

    Competitive price pressures in certain markets;  
                
    New commodity deposits are more difficult to find, harder and more expensive to extract, and lower in quantities; 
                
    End market demand in Latin America continues to be hampered by inconsistent construction spending and electrical infrastructure investment; 
                
    Recovery is slow in Europe and demand continues to be uneven for a broad spectrum of products in Europe; 
                
    The U.S. market has remained relatively stable compared to the uneven and challenging operating environments of the emerging economies; 
                
    New communications networks are an enabling technology, which require communication infrastructure investment; 
                
    Climate change concerns are resulting in increased regulatory energy mandates, emphasizing renewable sources of energy;  
                
    Project timing continues to be volatile resulting in a lag in demand in all segments; and 
                
    Countries are seeking greater energy independence for political and economic reasons. 
     The Company's overall financial results discussed in this section of the quarterly report reflect the above trends.

Metal-adjusted net sales, a non-GAAP financial measure, are provided below in order to eliminate an estimate of metal price volatility from the comparison of revenues from one period to another. The comparable GAAP financial measure is set forth above. 

Metal pounds sold is provided below as the Company believes this metric to be an appropriate measure of sales volume since it is not impacted by metal prices or foreign currency exchange rate changes. 

Consolidated: 
  Net sales decreased   $171.9 million  , or   16%  , in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     October 2, 2015  .  The net decrease is primarily attributable to:  
             
    Businesses sold as part of the restructuring and divestiture programs of   $55.1 million 
                
    Unfavorable copper and aluminum price changes of   $27.2 million    
                
    Unfavorable selling price and product mix of   $76.1 million

The decrease was primarily attributable to unfavorable market demand for industrial and specialty products, particularly those used in oil and gas applications, partially offset by favorable market demand for the North American construction and electric utility distribution businesses.  
  Europe 
  Net sales in the Europe segment decreased   $18.9 million  , or   8%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     October 2, 2015  .  The net decrease is primarily attributable to:

The increase in volume sold was primarily attributable to demand for electric utility cables including land-based turnkey and energy products in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     October 2, 2015  .   
  Latin America 
  Net sales in the Latin America segment decreased   $11.2 million  , or   7%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     October 2, 2015  . The net decrease is primarily attributable to:   
             
    The sale of Venezuela of   $2.2 million    
                
    Unfavorable copper and aluminum price changes of   $7.0 million

    Increased volume of   $2.7 million 
                
    Favorable foreign currency exchange rate changes on the translation of reported revenues of   $0.6 million 
     Volume, as measured by metal pounds sold, remained relatively flat in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     October 2, 2015  . Volume remains under pressure due to spending constraints on electric infrastructure and construction projects. 
  Africa/Asia Pacific 
  Net sales in the Africa/Asia Pacific segment decreased   $66.0 million  , or   53%   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     October 2, 2015  .  The net decrease is primarily attributable to:   
             
    Businesses sold as part of the divestiture program of $  27.5 million 
                
    Unfavorable copper and aluminum price changes of   $4.2 million 
                
    Unfavorable product mix of approximately   $20.0 million 
                
    Decreased volume of   $9.9 million    
                
    Unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate changes on the translation of reported revenues of   $4.4 million    
     Volume, as measured by metal pounds sold, decreased by   13.9 million   pounds, or   45%  , in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three months ended     October 2, 2015  . The decrease in volume sold is primarily attributable to the sale of Thailand in the third quarter of 2015 and the sale of India in the first quarter of 2016.  
  Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales decreased   $159.5 million   to   $821.6 million   in the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $981.1 million   in the   three months ended     October 2, 2015  .  The percentage decrease in cost of sales is consistent with the percentage decrease in sales.  As previously noted, cost of sales is raw material intensive with copper and aluminum comprising the major cost components for cable products.  At current metal prices, material costs are approximately   85%   of total product costs with copper and aluminum metal costs comprising approximately   45%   of total product cost. 
  Gross Profit  
  Gross profit decreased   $12.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three months ended     October 2, 2015  .  Gross profit as a percentage of sales was   11%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  .

  Net interest expense of   $22.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   remained relatively flat as compared to   $22.5 million   for the   three months ended     October 2, 2015  .    
  Tax Provision 
  The Company s effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 was   28.9%   and   (19.9)%  , respectively.  The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was favorably impacted by the mix of earnings in foreign jurisdictions with statutory tax rates lower than the   35%   U.S. federal statutory tax rate, and the recognition of no income tax expense on   $5.9 million   of pre-tax gain associated with the sale of the Venezuelan business.  These favorable factors were partially offset by recognizing no tax benefit on   $20.6 million   of operational losses incurred in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are recorded against net deferred tax assets. 
  The negative effective tax rate for the three months ended October 2, 2015 is primarily the result of recording income tax expense on the ordinary operational income of profitable jurisdictions while recording no income tax benefit on   $34.3 million   of operational losses incurred in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are recorded against net deferred tax assets, and no income tax benefit on a   $12.0 million   Venezuela deconsolidation charge.  These negative effective tax rate drivers were partially offset by   $11.5 million   of tax benefits associated with the exiting of the business in India.

Consolidated 
  Net sales decreased   $613.2 million  , or   17%  , in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     October 2, 2015  .  The net decrease is primarily attributable to:   
             
    Businesses sold as part of the restructuring and divestiture programs of $  156.5 million    
                
    Unfavorable copper and aluminum price changes of   $259.5 million

The decrease was primarily attributable to unfavorable market demand for specialty products, particularly those used in oil and gas applications, coupled with weak market demand for electric utility distribution products in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , which benefited from a very strong first half of 2015.  The decrease was partially offset by favorable market demand for the North American construction cable businesses.    
  Europe 
  Net sales in the Europe segment decreased   $80.2 million  , or   11%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     October 2, 2015  .  The net decrease is primarily attributable to:

    Sale of Venezuela of $  5.6 million    
                
    Unfavorable copper and aluminum price changes of   $62.7 million

The decrease in volume sold was primarily attributable to the deconsolidation of the Venezuelan subsidiary as of   October 2, 2015   and end market demand pressure throughout the region due to ongoing difficult economic conditions and reduced government spending. 
  Africa/Asia Pacific 
  Net sales in the Africa/Asia Pacific segment decreased   $196.6 million  , or   45%   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended     October 2, 2015  . The net decrease is primarily attributable to:

Cost of Sales 
  Cost of sales decreased   $578.7 million   to   $2,615.4 million   in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $3,194.1 million   in the   nine months ended     October 2, 2015  .  The percentage decrease in cost of sales is consistent with the percentage decrease in sales.  As previously noted, cost of sales is raw material intensive with copper and aluminum comprising the major cost components for cable products.  At current metal prices, material costs are approximately   85%   of total product costs with copper and aluminum metal costs comprising approximately   45%   of total product cost. 
  Gross Profit  
  Gross profit decreased   $34.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     October 2, 2015  .  Gross profit as a percentage of sales was   11%   and   10%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , respectively.  
  SG A Expenses

    Unfavorable impact of the   $14.4 million   pre-tax loss from the disposition of Zambia in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016

     Other Income (Expense) 
  Other income (expense) includes foreign currency transaction gains or losses, which result from changes in exchange rates between the designated functional currency and the currency in which a transaction is denominated, as well as gains and losses on derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , the Company recorded other income of   $4.7 million   and other expense of   $61.9 million  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , other income was primarily attributable to   $0.9 million   related to foreign currency transaction gains and   $3.8 million   related to gains on derivative instruments that were not designated as cash flow hedges. For the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2015  , other expense was primarily attributable to the adoption of the SIMADI currency exchange system in Venezuela and ongoing remeasurement of the local balance sheet which resulted in an expense of   $22.9 million  ,   $39.7 million   related to other foreign currency transaction losses and   $0.7 million   related to gains on derivative instruments that were not designated as cash flow hedges.

  Interest Expense 
  Net interest expense decreased to   $66.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $72.0 million   for the   nine months ended     October 2, 2015   primarily due to cash proceeds from divestitures which were utilized to pay down debt and the efficient management of working capital in the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as well as the incremental interest expense on the Company's Senior Floating Rate Notes recognized in the   nine months ended     October 2, 2015  .    
  Tax Provision 
  The Company s effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and October 2, 2015 was   44.8%   and   1.1%  , respectively.  The effective tax rate on the Company s pre-tax income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was favorably impacted by the use of U.S. capital losses for which no tax benefit was previously recognized.  This resulted in the recognition of only   $2.4 million   of income tax expense on   $53.2 million   of pre-tax gain associated with the sale of the North American Automotive Ignition Wire business.  This favorable factor was largely offset by recognizing no tax benefit on   $44.2 million   of operational losses incurred in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are recorded against net deferred tax assets. 
  The relatively low effective tax rate on the Company s pre-tax loss for the nine months ended October 2, 2015 was primarily due to no tax benefit being available for the   $22.9 million   currency devaluation loss and foreign currency loss in Venezuela, no tax benefit being recognized on   $95.0 million   of operational losses incurred in jurisdictions where valuation allowances are recorded against net deferred tax assets, and no tax benefit being recognized on the   $12.0 million   Venezuelan deconsolidation loss.  These unfavorable factors were partially offset by   $5.4 million   of tax benefits associated with the net release of uncertain tax position reserves,   $4.3 million   of tax benefits associated with valuation allowance releases, and   $11.5 million   of tax benefits associated with tax deductions connected to the exiting of the business in India.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Cash flows from operations as well as borrowings under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility provide the primary source for financing operating expenses and other short term liquidity needs.  As necessary the Company incurs additional borrowings to fund working capital needs, debt and interest payments, as well as discretionary investment in internal product development, acquisitions, cash dividends and to fund tax payments.  The overall cash position of the Company reflects the business results and a global cash management strategy that incorporates liquidity management, economic factors, and tax considerations. 
  The Company's short term borrowings vary by period based on the Company's working capital requirements which is dependent on incremental demand for products and changes in the price of copper, aluminum, and other raw material cost inputs.  At   September 30, 2016  , current assets exceeded current liabilities by   $843.5 million  .  Based upon historical experience, the cash on its balance sheet and the expected availability of funds under its credit facilities, the Company believes its sources of liquidity will be sufficient to enable it to meet funding requirements for cash dividends, working capital, capital expenditures, debt repayment, salaries and related benefits, restructuring activities, and interest and taxes for the next twelve months and foreseeable future.  The Company maintains approximately   $446.3 million   of excess availability under its various credit facilities around the world.  
  The Company's North American and principal European operations generally borrow and repay under its Revolving Credit Facility multiple times per week for working capital needs; borrowing on a short term basis is the most effective method to reduce interest costs based on the terms of the agreement.  The Company's European operations also participate in accounts payable confirming arrangements with several European financial institutions to address working capital requirements in the business.  At   September 30, 2016  , the arrangements had a maximum availability limit of the equivalent of approximately   $167.7 million  .  The Company utilized   $151.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company's Latin America and Africa/Asia Pacific operations utilize various short term credit facilities for working capital purposes.   
  General Cable Corporation is a holding company with no operations of its own.  All of the Company s operations are conducted, and net sales are generated, by its subsidiaries and investments.  Accordingly, the Company s cash flow comes from the cash flows of its global operations.  The Company s ability to use cash flow from its international operations, if necessary, has historically been adversely affected by limitations on the Company s ability to repatriate such earnings tax efficiently.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximately   98%   and   99%   of cash and cash equivalents were held outside of the U.S. by the Company's foreign subsidiaries, respectively.  If these funds are needed for the Company's operations in the U.S., repatriation of the funds would generally result in foreign withholding taxes and the recognition of U.S. taxable income.  However, the Company does not foresee a need to repatriate this cash to fund U.S. operations.  In addition, the Company's Revolving Credit Facility provides the Company flexibility in financing operating expenses and any other short term liquidity needs of the Company's North American and European operations. 
  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , the Minority Shareholders elected to exercise the Put Option to sell their entire   40%   interest in Procables to the Company.  The Put Option will be paid by the Company based on the final per share purchase price, and is expected to be approximately   $18 million  . 
  Summary of Cash Flows 
  Operating cash inflow of   $65.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflects a net working capital source of   $5.8 million   as compared to a net working capital source of   $40.8 million   in the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2015  .  The net working capital source in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is primarily due to a decrease in inventories of   $58.5 million   as the Company has continued to tightly manage inventory levels partially offset by an increase in receivables of   $29.1 million    due to the elevated amount of sales that occurred in the months prior to   September 30, 2016  , particularly in September, as compared to   December 31, 2015   where sales declined over the final months of the year as well as a decrease in accounts payables, accrued and other liabilities of   $24.0 million   due to management of inventory levels and decreased working capital needs.  In addition, the operating cash inflow of   $65.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   reflects a source of   $60.1 million   related to net income (loss) adjusted for depreciation and amortization, foreign currency exchange (gains) losses, deferred income taxes, non-cash asset impairment charges, Venezuela deconsolidation charge, non-cash interest charges, (gain) loss on disposal of subsidiaries and losses on disposal of property.   
  The cash inflow from investing activities was   $27.8 million   in the   nine   fiscal months ended   September 30, 2016  , primarily reflecting   $80.0 million   of proceeds from the disposal of subsidiaries, partially offset by   $53.5 million   of capital expenditures. The Company anticipates capital spending to be approximately   $90 million   to   $110 million   in   2016  . 
  Financing activities resulted in   $89.0 million   and   $203.4 million   of cash outflows in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , respectively.  In the   nine   months ended   October 2, 2015  , the Company repaid its $125.0 million of Senior Floating Rate Notes at maturity by utilizing availability under its Revolving Credit Facility.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , the Company paid dividends in total of approximately   $26.7 million   and   $26.5 million   to all common shareholders of record, respectively.  Future declarations of dividends and the establishment of future record dates and payment dates are subject to the final determination of our Board of Directors.  In determining dividends, the Board of Directors  
  
   56 

     Table of Contents  

takes into consideration items such as general business conditions, financial performance, projected cash flows and anticipated financing needs.  Future payments of dividends are also subject to the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, the indentures governing the Subordinated Convertible Notes and 5.75% Senior Notes, and the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation law.  The Company evaluates various factors such as future operating cash flow requirements, other cash flow expectations, investment and financing strategic plans and the overall cost of capital to determine the appropriate levels of short and long-term debt to maintain.  Refer to "Debt and Other Contractual Obligations" below for details.   
  Debt and Other Contractual Obligations 
  The Company s outstanding debt obligations were   $993.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and the Company maintained approximately   $446.3 million   of excess availability under its various credit facilities around the world.  The Company utilizes short and long-term debt to address working capital needs, restructuring payments, debt repayments and interest payments as well as discretionary investments in internal product development, acquisitions, payment of dividends, repurchase of common stock and taxes.  Short-term liquidity and working capital needs are generally supported through operating cash flows.  The Company maintains ratings on its public debt; therefore, the Company has and expects to continue to obtain market rates on any new borrowings.  
  On July 21, 2011, the Company entered into a   $400 million   Revolving Credit Facility, which was first amended in 2012 to increase the facility size to   $700 million   and then subsequently amended and restated on September 6, 2013 and further amended on October 22, 2013, May 20, 2014, September 23, 2014, October 28, 2014, and February 9, 2016 to, among other things, increase the Revolving Credit Facility to   $1.0 billion  ,   $630 million   of which may be borrowed by the U.S. borrower,   $300 million   of which may be borrowed by the European borrowers and   $70 million   of which may be borrowed by the Canadian borrower. The Revolving Credit Facility contains restrictions including limitations on, among other things, distributions and dividends, acquisitions and investments, indebtedness, liens and affiliate transactions.  The Revolving Credit Facility provides the Company with flexibility and the restrictions in the Revolving Credit Facility generally only apply in the event that the Company's availability under the Revolving Credit Facility falls below certain specific thresholds. 
  The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of September 6, 2018. The commitment amount under the Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by an additional   $250 million  , subject to certain conditions and approvals as set forth in the Revolving Credit Facility. The Revolving Credit Facility requires maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of   1.00   to   1.00   if availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is less than the greater of   $100 million   or   10%   of the then existing aggregate lender commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the availability under the Revolving Credit Facility is greater than   $100 million  .  
  Failure to comply with any of the covenants, financial tests and ratios required by the Company's existing or future debt obligations could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions, as defined in the Company's Revolving Credit Facility, Subordinated Convertible Notes, 5.75% Senior Notes and various other credit facilities maintained by the Company's subsidiaries.  A default would permit lenders to cease making further extensions of credit, accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and foreclose upon any collateral securing that debt. Indebtedness under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility is secured by: (a) for US borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company's domestic assets and, (b) for Canadian and European borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility, a first priority security interest in substantially all of the Company's domestic and Canadian assets and certain assets of the Company's Spanish, French and German subsidiaries party to the Revolving Credit Facility.   In addition, the lenders under the Company's Revolving Credit Facility have received a pledge of (i) 100% of the equity interests in substantially all of the Company's domestic subsidiaries, and (ii) 65% of the voting equity interests in and 100% of the non-voting equity interests in certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries, including the Company's Canadian subsidiaries and the Company's Spanish, French and German subsidiaries party to the Revolving Credit Facility. The Company also has incurred secured debt in connection with some of its European operations. The lenders under these European secured credit facilities also have liens on assets of certain of our European subsidiaries. As a result of these pledges and liens, if the Company fails to meet its payment or other obligations under any of its secured indebtedness, the lenders under the applicable credit agreement would be entitled to foreclose and liquidate substantially all of the Company's assets. Broadly, cross-default provisions would permit lenders to cause such indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity in the event a default is not cured for a period of time under the terms of one or more financing agreements, or a change in control or a fundamental change occurs.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company was in compliance with all material debt covenants. 
  The Company s defined benefit plans at   December 31, 2015   were underfunded by   $121.0 million  . Pension expense for the Company s defined benefit pension plans for the   nine   fiscal months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $9.3 million   and cash contributions were approximately   $3.9 million  . 
  The Company anticipates being able to meet its obligations as they come due based on historical operating and financing experience and the expected availability of funds under its current credit facilities.  At   September 30, 2016  , maturities of long-term debt during  
  
   57 

     Table of Contents  

the twelve month periods beginning   September 30, 2016   through   October 1, 2021   and thereafter are   $96.1 million  ,   $112.5 million  ,   $10.8 million  ,   $0.8 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively, and   $771.2 million   thereafter.  
  Off Balance Sheet Assets and Obligations 
  The Company has entered into various operating lease agreements related principally to certain administrative, manufacturing and distribution facilities and transportation equipment.  At   September 30, 2016  , future minimum rental payments required under non-cancelable lease agreements during the twelve month periods beginning   September 30, 2016   through   October 1, 2021   and thereafter are   $17.9 million  ,   $11.3 million  ,   $8.0 million  ,   $6.2 million   and   $5.1 million  , respectively, and   $12.7 million   thereafter. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $22.3 million   in letters of credit,   $223.8 million   in various performance bonds and   $77.0 million   in other guarantees.  Other guarantees include bank guarantees and advance payment bonds.  These letters of credit, performance bonds and guarantees are periodically renewed and are generally related to risk associated with self-insurance claims, defined benefit plan obligations, contract performance, quality and other various bank and financing guarantees.  Advance payment bonds are often required by customers when the Company obtains advance payments to secure the production of cable for long-term contracts.  The advance payment bonds provide the customer protection on their deposit in the event that the Company does not perform under the contract. 
  Environmental Matters 
  The Company's expenditures for environmental compliance and remediation amounted to approximately   $2.4 million   and   $1.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   October 2, 2015  , respectively.  In addition, certain General Cable subsidiaries have been named as potentially responsible parties in proceedings that involve environmental remediation.  The Company has accrued   $4.6 million   and   $3.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and at   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for all environmental liabilities.  Environmental matters are further described in Note 18 - Commitments and Contingencies.  While it is difficult to estimate future environmental liabilities, the Company does not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial position as a result of compliance with federal, state, local or foreign environmental laws or regulations or remediation costs. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The Company s significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited annual consolidated financial statements in the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K.  In the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there have been no significant changes to these policies.  The application of these policies requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements.  Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, information that is available to management about current events and actions the Company may take in the future and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  In addition, significant estimates and judgments include allowances for accounts receivable and deferred income taxes; legal, environmental, and asbestos liabilities; inventory costing and valuation; uncertain tax positions; assets and obligations related to pension and other postretirement benefits; intangible and long-lived asset valuations; financial instruments; and revenue recognized under the percentage-of-completion method.  There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates. 
  New Accounting Standards 
  A discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements is described in Note 2 - Accounting Standards, Item 1 - Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of this report, and we incorporate such discussion in this MD A by reference and make it a part hereof.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  The Company is exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and raw material (commodity) prices. To manage risk associated with the volatility of these natural business exposures, the Company enters into interest rate, commodity and foreign currency derivative agreements as well as copper and aluminum forward pricing agreements. The Company does not purchase or sell derivative instruments for trading purposes. The Company does not engage in trading activities involving commodity contracts for which a lack of marketplace quotations would necessitate the use of fair value estimation techniques. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   no   derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO"), as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure  .   A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. 
  In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q an evaluation was performed, as of   September 30, 2016  , under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the CEO and CFO, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on that evaluation, the Company s CEO and CFO concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as such item is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a 15(f) and 15d 15(f), during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

  CFO CONSULTING AGREEMENT 
  THIS CFO CONSULTING AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") is made and effective as of August 3, 2016 (the "Effective Date"), by and between General Cable Corporation (the "Company"), and Kreidler Advisory Services LLC ("Consultant"). 
  WHEREAS, the Company desires to retain Consultant to act as the Company's interim principal financial officer (as defined in the rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), and Consultant desires to serve in that capacity; 
  WHEREAS, in that role Consultant will serve as the Company's Interim Chief Financial Officer and will perform all functions related thereto; 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and obligations herein, and other valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties agree as follows: 
  1.               Consulting Services  .   
       (a)      During the term of this Agreement, Consultant will provide the Services (as defined below), as the Company's Interim Chief Financial Officer.  The Services under this Agreement will all be performed by Robert C. Kreidler and may not be delegated to other persons, including other employees of Consultant.  Consultant will provide the Services a minimum of three (3) full business days per week, working at least three (3) business days per work week at the Company's headquarters in Highland Heights, KY, or occasionally at such other locations designated by Company as business needs may dictate.  Consultant's exact schedule and the days on which he works will be mutually agreed upon by him and the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ).

Consultant shall exercise reasonable skill and care in providing the Services hereunder, and shall perform the Services in a professional manner, consistent with industry standards.  
       (b)       If and to the extent requested by the Company s CEO or Board of Directors, following the termination of this Agreement, Consultant will provide such assistance and certifications as may be requested or necessary in order to enable the Company to make timely filing of its next succeeding quarterly or annual report on Form 10-Q or 10-K, respectively, required to be filed by the Company following the termination of this Agreement.  To the extent that Consultant is requested to provide such assistance and certifications, Consultant shall be compensated at the same rate as for the Services as described herein, pro-rated based on the time spent in so doing, and for purposes of this Agreement, such additional assistance and services shall be deemed to be part of the Services hereunder.

  (a)      During the term of this Agreement, the Company shall pay Consultant a fee of $25,000 for each full week that Consultant provides Services. Payments for Services shall be made to Consultant on a bi-weekly basis within  

one week after the receipt of an invoice from the Consultant.  With regard to any partial weeks, Consultant shall be paid a pro-rata fee based on a 24-hour work week. 
  (b)      During the term of this Agreement, Consultant shall bill and the Company shall reimburse the Consultant for all reasonable and approved out-of-pocket expenses which are incurred in connection with the performance of the Services hereunder, including, but not limited to, commuting and housing costs each week, consistent with the Company s expense reimbursement policy. 
  (c)      The Consultant is solely responsible for the payment of all income, social security, employment-related, or other taxes incurred as a result of the performance of the Services by Consultant under this Agreement and for all obligations, reports, and timely notifications relating to such taxes. The Company shall have no obligation to pay or withhold any sums for such taxes. 
  3.      Term   Termination  .     This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue until terminated as set forth below.  
       (a)        Termination for Convenience  .  Consultant may terminate this Agreement at any time for any or for no reason by giving the Company thirty (30) days' prior written notice of termination; the Company may terminate this Agreement at any time for any or for no reason by giving Consultant five (5) days  prior written notice of termination. 
       (b)        Termination for Cause  .  The Company may immediately terminate Consultant s engagement for Cause upon written notice of termination to Consultant, with the particular Cause being specified in such notice.

  4.      Work Product  .  All Work Product (defined below) shall be work made for hire by Consultant and owned by the Company.   If any of the Work Product may not, by operation of law or otherwise, be considered work made for hire by Consultant for the Company, or if ownership of all right, title, and interest to the legal rights therein shall not otherwise vest exclusively in the Company, Consultant hereby assigns to the Company, and upon the future creation thereof automatically assign to the Company, without further consideration, the ownership of all Work Product.  The Company shall have the right to obtain and hold in its own name copyrights, patents, registrations, and any other protection available in the Work Product.  Consultant agrees to perform, during or after termination of Consultant s engagement, such further acts as may be necessary or desirable to transfer, perfect, and defend the Company s ownership of the Work Product as requested by the Company.   For purposes of this letter,  Work Product  means the data, materials, formulas, research, documentation, computer programs, communication systems, audio systems, system designs, inventions (whether or not patentable), and all works of authorship, including all worldwide rights therein under patent, copyright, trade secret, confidential information, moral rights and other property rights, created or developed in whole or in part by Consultant, while engaged by the Company and its affiliates, within the scope of Consultant s engagement or that otherwise relates in any manner to the business or projected business of the Company and its affiliates. 
  5.      Confidentiality/ Non-Disparagement/ Non-Solicitation/ Non-Competition/ Company Policies.    
    (a)      The Consultant acknowledges that during the engagement he will have access to and become acquainted with various confidential or proprietary information, including pending or potential transactions, financial information concerning the Company, its business plans, personnel and strategies, trade secrets, inventions, innovations, processes, information, records and specifications owned or licensed by the Company and/or used by the Company in connection with the operation of its business including, without limitation, the Company s business and product processes, methods, customer lists, accounts and procedures. The Consultant agrees that Consultant will not disclose any of the aforesaid confidential or proprietary information, directly or indirectly, or use any of them in any manner, either during the term of this Agreement or at any time thereafter, except as required in the course of this engagement with the Company.  To the extent permitted by law and subject to Section 10 below, upon receipt of any subpoena,  
  
   2 

court order, or other legal process compelling the disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, Consultant agrees to give prompt written notice to the Company so as to permit the Company to protect its interests in confidentiality to the fullest extent possible.  All files, records, documents, blueprints, specifications, information, letters, notes, media lists, original artwork/creative, notebooks, and similar items relating to the business of the Company, whether prepared by the Consultant or otherwise coming into Consultant s possession, shall remain the exclusive property of the Company.  Consultant shall not retain any copies of the foregoing without the Company s prior written permission. Upon the termination of this Agreement, or whenever requested by the Company, Consultant shall immediately deliver to the Company all such files, records, documents, specifications, information, and other items in Consultant s possession or under Consultant s control.   
  (b)    Consultant agrees that for so long as Consultant is engaged by the Company or any of its affiliates hereunder and for a period of three years after the date Consultant ceases to be engaged by the Company and its affiliates for any reason, Consultant will not disparage the Company or its officers, directors, or affiliates in any way, or through any medium. Consultant agrees to provide full cooperation and assistance in assisting the Company to investigate such statements if the Company reasonably believes that Consultant is the source of any such statements.  The foregoing shall not apply to statutorily privileged statements made to governmental or law enforcement agencies.  
  (c)    Consultant agrees that for so long as Consultant is engaged by the Company or any of its affiliates hereunder and for a period of 12 months after the date Consultant ceases to be engaged by the Company and its affiliates for any reason, neither Consultant nor any company or other entity controlled by Consultant (whether currently existing or hereafter acquired or formed) shall, directly or indirectly, in any capacity, (i) solicit or induce, or attempt to solicit or induce, any person who accepts employment with the Company and its affiliates to leave the employ of the Company or any of its affiliates for any reason whatsoever, or (ii) hire or employ any person who accepts employment with the Company and its affiliates. 
  (d)    Consultant agrees that for so long as Consultant is engaged by the Company or any of its affiliates hereunder, neither Consultant nor any company or other entity controlled by Consultant (whether currently existing or hereafter acquired or formed) shall, directly or indirectly, in any capacity, engage in any employment or business activity for a company that competes with the business of the Company and its affiliates, in any country in which the Company or any of its affiliates does business.  Consultant agrees that, given the nature of the business of the Company and its affiliates and Consultant s position, the foregoing geographic scope is appropriate and reasonable. 
  (e)    Consultant agrees that Consultant will comply with the Company s Code of Ethics and Business Conduct and Insider Trading Policy, and Consultant will comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations in the performance of the Services. 
  6.         Conflicts of Interest.     The Consultant represents that Consultant is free to enter into this Agreement and that this engagement does not violate the terms of any agreement between the Consultant and any third party. Further, the Consultant, in rendering Consultant s duties, shall not utilize any invention, discovery, development, improvement, innovation, or trade secret in which Consultant does not have a proprietary interest.  
  7.      Indemnification and D O Insurance.     The Company agrees to defend, indemnify (including, without limitation, by providing for the advancement of expenses and reasonable attorneys  fees) and hold harmless Consultant for any and all acts taken or omitted to be taken by Consultant hereunder (except for bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct) as if Consultant was an officer of the Company to the extent provided in the charter and bylaws of the Company in accordance with the same terms, conditions, limitations, standards, duties, rights and obligations as are applicable to an officer. The provisions of this Section shall survive any termination of this Agreement. 
  8.      Independent Consultant  .   This Agreement shall not render Consultant an employee, partner, agent of, or joint venturer with the Company for any purpose. Consultant is and will remain an independent contractor in his relationship to the Company. The Company shall not be responsible for withholding taxes with respect to the Consultant s compensation hereunder.  Consultant shall have no claim against the Company hereunder or otherwise for vacation pay, sick leave, retirement benefits, social security, worker s compensation, health or disability benefits, unemployment insurance benefits, or employee benefits of any kind.

9.      Remedies  . Consultant acknowledges that breach of the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 would result in irreparable injury and permanent damage to the Company and its affiliates, which prohibitions or restrictions Consultant acknowledges are both reasonable and necessary under the circumstances, singularly and in the aggregate, to protect the interests of the Company and its affiliates.  Consultant recognizes and agrees that the ascertainment of damages in the event of a breach of Sections 4 and 5 would be difficult, and that money damages alone would be an inadequate remedy for the injuries and damages that would be suffered by the Company and its affiliates from breach by Consultant.  Consultant therefore agrees: (i) that, in the event of a breach of Sections 4 or 5,  the Company, in addition to and without limiting any of the remedies or rights that it may have at law or in equity or pursuant to this Agreement, shall have the right to injunctive relief or other similar remedy to specifically enforce the provisions hereof; and (ii) to waive and not to (A) assert any defense to the effect that the Company has an adequate remedy at law with respect to any such breach, (B) require that the Company submit proof of the economic value of any trade secret, or (C) require that the Company post a bond or any other security.  Nothing contained herein shall preclude the Company from seeking monetary damages of any kind, including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and other expenses, in a court of law.  Consultant and the Company agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Campbell County, KY for all matters arising under this Agreement.   
  10.      Reports to Government Entities  . Nothing in this Agreement shall restrict or prohibit Consultant from initiating communications directly with, responding to any inquiries from, providing testimony before, providing confidential information to, reporting possible violations of law or regulation to, or from filing a claim or assisting with an investigation directly with a self-regulatory authority or a government agency or entity, including the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the Department of Labor, the National Labor Relations Board, the Department of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Congress, and any agency Inspector General (collectively, the  Regulators ), or from making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of state or federal law or regulation.  Please take notice that federal law provides criminal and civil immunity to federal and state claims for trade secret misappropriation to individuals who disclose a trade secret to their attorney, a court, or a government official in certain, confidential circumstances that are set forth at 18 U.S.C.    1833(b)(1) and 1833(b)(2), related to the reporting or investigation of a suspected violation of the law, or in connection with a lawsuit for retaliation for reporting a suspected violation of the law.  Consultant does not need the prior authorization of the Company to engage in such communications with the Regulators, respond to such inquiries from the Regulators, provide confidential information or documents to the Regulators, or make any such reports or disclosures to the Regulators.  Consultant is not required to notify the Company that Consultant has engaged in such communications with the Regulators. 
  11.      Successors and Assigns.    All of the provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, if any, successors, and permitted assigns. 
  12.      Choice of Law.   The laws of the state of Kentucky shall govern the validity of this Agreement, the construction of its terms and the interpretation of the rights and duties of the parties hereto.   
  13.      Arbitration  . Except as provided in Section 9, any controversies arising out of the terms of this Agreement or its interpretation shall be settled in Campbell County, KY in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association, and the judgment upon award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.   
  14.      Headings  . Section headings are not to be considered a part of this Agreement and are not intended to be a full and accurate description of the contents hereof. 
  15.      Waiver  . Waiver by one party hereto of breach of any provision of this Agreement by the other shall not operate or be construed as a continuing waiver. 
  16.      Assignment  .   The Consultant shall not assign any of his rights under this Agreement, or delegate the performance of any of his duties hereunder, without the prior written consent of the Company. 
  17.      Notices  . Any and all notices, demands, or other communications required or desired to be given hereunder by any party shall be in writing and shall be validly given or made to another party if personally served, or if deposited
