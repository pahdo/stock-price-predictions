BIOLARGO, INC.   
   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
   (Unaudited)   
   FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015   

Note 1. Business and Organization    
     
     Outlook      
     
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of our business. As reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had a net loss of $5,796,831, and cash used in operations of $2,799,096, for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, and at September 30, 2016, we had working capital of $1,041,864, current assets of $1,873,107, and an accumulated stockholders  deficit of $89,680,852. The foregoing factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Ultimately, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to attract significant new sources of capital, attain a reasonable threshold of operating efficiencies and achieve profitable operations by licensing or otherwise commercializing products incorporating our technologies. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.   
     
  We have been, and anticipate that we will continue to be, limited in terms of our capital resources. Our total cash balance was $1,731,946 at September 30, 2016. We had revenues of $215,249 in the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, which amount was not sufficient to fund our operations. We generally have not had enough cash or sources of capital to pay our accounts payable and expenses as they arise, and have relied on the issuance of stock options and common stock, as well as extended payment terms with our vendors, to continue to operate. We will be required to raise substantial additional capital to expand our operations, including without limitation, hiring additional personnel, additional scientific and third-party testing, costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals and filing additional patent applications to protect our intellectual property, and possible strategic acquisitions or alliances, as well as to meet our liabilities as they become due for the next 12 months.     
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had $5,447,876 in principal amounts due on various debt obligations (see Note 4). Of that amount, $4,834,305 is due on notes convertible into shares of our common stock at our option on their maturity dates on June 1, 2018, $283,571 is convertible into shares of our common stock at our option on their maturity dates on September 17, 2019, and $280,000, maturing July 8, 2017, is convertible by the holder at any time. We also had $50,000 principal amount outstanding due on a line of credit that is payable December 1, 2017. Interest continues to accrue on each of these notes. Additionally, we had $290,076 of accounts payable and accrued expenses (see Note 7).     
     
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for interim financial information and pursuant to Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for annual financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Annual Report on   Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on March 30, 2016.  
     
  We operate six wholly-owned subsidiaries: BioLargo Life Technologies, Inc., organized under the laws of the State of California in 2006, Odor-No-More, Inc., organized under the laws of the State of California in 2009, BioLargo Water USA, Inc., organized under the laws of the State of California in 2013, BioLargo Water, Inc., organized under the laws of Canada in 2014, BioLargo Maritime Solutions, Inc. organized under the laws of the State of California in 2016, and BioLargo Development Corp., organized under the laws of the State of California in 2016. Additionally, we are majority owner of Clyra Medical Technologies, Inc., organized under the laws of the State of California in 2012.

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
     
     Principles of Consolidation     
     
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  
         
     Use of Estimates     
     
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the period reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates are used when accounting for stock-based compensation and financing transactions, uncollectible accounts receivable, asset impairment and amortization, and taxes, among others.  
     
  The methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying these most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results of our financial statements.    
        
     Share-based Payments     
         
  All share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values.  
     
  For stock issued to consultants and other non-employees for services, we record the expense based on the fair market value of the securities as of the date of the stock issuance. The issuance of fully vested stock warrants or options to non-employees are valued at the time of issuance utilizing the Black Scholes calculation and the amount is charged to expense. The issuance of stock warrants or options to non-employees that vest over time are revalued each reporting period until vested to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the warrants or options vest, they are valued on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the then current value on the date of vesting.  
     
     Non-Cash Transactions     
     
  We have established a policy relative to the methodology to determine the value assigned to each intangible we acquire, and/or services or products received for non-cash consideration of our common stock. The value is based on the market price of our common stock issued as consideration, at the date of the agreement of each transaction or when the service is rendered or product is received.  
     
     Foreign Currency     
     
  The Company has designated the functional currency of Biolargo Water, Inc., our Canadian subsidiary, to be the Canadian dollar. Therefore, translation gains and losses resulting from differences in exchange rates are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  
     
     Revenue Recognition     
     
  Revenues are recognized as risk and title to products transfers to the customer (which generally occurs at the time shipment is made), the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We also may generate revenues from royalties and license fees from our intellectual property. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee.

Government Grants     
     
  We have been awarded grants from the Canadian National Research Institute   Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP) and the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). The government grants received are considered other income and are included in our consolidated statements of operations. We received our first grant in 2015 and have been awarded 30 grants totaling approximately $1,100,000. Some of the funds from these grants are given directly to third parties (such as the University of Alberta) to support research on our technology. The grants have terms generally ranging between six and eighteen months and support a majority, but not all of the related research budget costs. This cooperative research allows us to utilize (i) a depth of resources and talent to accomplish highly skilled work, (ii) financial aid to support research and development costs, (iii) independent and credible validation of our technical claims.   
      
  The grants provide for (i) recurring monthly amounts and (ii) reimbursement of costs for research talent for which we invoice to request payment and (iii) ancillary cost reimbursement for research talent travel related costs. All awarded grants have specific requirements on how the money is spent, typically to employ researchers. None of the funds may be used for general administrative expenses or overhead in the United States. These grants have substantially increased our level of research and development activities in Canada. We continue to apply for Canadian government and agency grants to fund research and development activities. Not all of our grant applications have been awarded, and no assurance can be made that any pending grant application, or any future grant applications, will be awarded.  
     
     Earnings (Loss) Per Share      
     
  We report basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share ( EPS ) for common and common share equivalents. Basic EPS is computed by dividing reported earnings by the weighted average shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by adding to the weighted average shares the dilutive effect if stock options and warrants were exercised into common stock. For the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, the denominator in the diluted EPS computation is the same as the denominator for basic EPS due to the anti-dilutive effect of the warrants and stock options on the Company s net loss.     
     
     Recent Accounting Pronouncements     
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  "Leases (Topic 842),"  which will require lessees to recognize almost all leases on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. For income statement purposes, the FASB retained a dual model, requiring leases to be classified as either operating or finance. Classification will be based on criteria that are largely similar to those applied in current lease accounting, but without explicit bright lines. Lessor accounting is similar to the current model, but updated to align with certain changes to the lessee model and the new revenue recognition standard. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the potential impact this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . The amendments in this update change existing guidance related to accounting for employee share-based payments affecting the income tax consequences of awards, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard.  
     
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing . The update provides guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing:  

1.   
 
  Identifying Performance Obligations:     

a.   
 
  When identifying performance obligations, whether it is necessary to assess whether promised goods or services are performance obligations if they are immaterial in the context of the contract.     

b.   
 
  Determining whether promised goods and services are separately identifiable (that is, distinct within the context of the contract)     

c.   
 
  Determining whether shipping and handling activities are a promised service in a contract or are activities to fulfill an entity s other promises in the contract.     

2.   
 
  Licensing:     

a.   
 
  Determining whether the nature of an entity s promise in granting a license is to provide a right to access the entity s intellectual property, which is satisfied over time and for which revenue is recognized over time, or to provide a right to use the entity s intellectual property, which is satisfied at a point in time and for which revenue is recognized at a point in time.     

b.   
 
  The scope and applicability of the guidance about when to recognize revenue for sales-based or usage-based royalties promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property     

c.   
 
  Distinguishing contractual provisions that require an entity to transfer additional licenses (that is, rights to use or access intellectual property) to a customer from contractual provisions that define the 2 attributes of a promised license (for example, restrictions of time, geographical region, or use).     

7

The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606. . The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard.  

Note 3. Deposits   
     
     Royalty Revenue     
     
  In 2012, we executed a joint venture agreement with Peter Holdings Pty. Ltd., the principal developer of the Isan System, whereby we jointly purchased the intellectual property associated with the Isan System, and agreed to share any royalties from any licensing revenue generated from the Isan System on an equal 50/50 basis.   
     
  In February 2014, we received a deposit of $100,000 from InsulTech Manufacturing, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company d/b/a Clarion Water ( Clarion Water ) towards a worldwide, exclusive license of the Isan System. On August 12, 2014, we entered into a license agreement with Clarion Water in which we granted an exclusive license to commercialize the Isan System for a term expiring the latter of 10 years or upon the expiration of the licensed patents. The license agreement provides that the $100,000 deposit is non-refundable, and is to be credited to future payments of royalties or sublicense fees due under the license agreement. The agreement further provides for a 10% royalty of licensee s  net sales revenue , and 40% of sublicensing fees. Licensee is required to make minimum payments beginning July 1, 2016, of $50,000 per quarter to maintain exclusivity and as of July 1, 2016, the Licensee is not making this payment and has relinquished exclusivity rights. The intellectual property subject to the license agreement includes all intellectual property related to the Isan System, including all patents, trademarks, proprietary knowledge, and other similar know-how or rights relating to or arising out of the Isan System or the patents related to the Isan System. The agreement contains other terms and conditions typically found in intellectual property license agreements. Clarion Water s work to commercialize the Isan System continues. (See Part I, Item 2,  Our Business   Clarion Water .)  
     
  We are obligated to share any revenues under the agreement on an equal basis with Peter Holdings Pty. Ltd. On July 1, 2016, per the terms of the agreement the $100,000 deposit received in 2014 was recorded to Royalty revenue, offset by the $45,000 share paid to Peter Holdings Pty. Ltd.

Note 4. Debt Obligations   
     
  The following table summarizes our debt obligations outstanding as of the dates indicated:  

For the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded $247,310 and $564,383 of interest expense and for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded $1,087,578 and $1,972,428 of interest expense related to the amortization of the discount on our convertible notes payable and interest expense related to our outstanding convertible promissory notes and line of credit.  

2015 Unit Offering        
     
  On January 15, 2015, we commenced a private securities offering of  units , each Unit consisting of a convertible promissory note and Series A stock purchase warrant ( 2015 Unit Offering ), which was closed on September 16, 2016. The price and availability of the Units were set forth in five  Pricing Supplements  issued from time-to-time. Each note issued is convertible into the Company s common stock at the Unit price set forth in the particular pricing supplement, and matures June 1, 2018. Because more than $3,000,000 was invested, we are obligated to register the common shares underlying the notes and warrants ( Shares ) with the Securities and Exchange Commission.     
     
  Interest due will be paid quarterly in arrears in cash or shares of common stock; all interest due thus far has been paid in shares of common stock. If paid by the issuance of common stock, interest is paid at a conversion price equal to the average closing price of the Company s common stock over the 20 trading days prior to the interest payment due date. The principal amount of the note may be paid by the issuance of shares of common stock, or cash, upon maturity at the Company s election. When paid in shares, the number of shares to be issued shall be calculated by dividing the principal amount invested by the Unit price, as it is established at the time of the original investment by the applicable Pricing Supplement. The notes may be converted at any time by the investor, at maturity by the Company, or by the Company prior to maturity, so long as all of the following conditions are met: (i) the Shares issued as payment are registered with the SEC, (ii) the Company s common stock closes for ten consecutive trading days at or above three times the Unit price.   
     
  Each investor, for no additional consideration, received a Series A stock purchase warrant. (See Note 6).  
  Each Series A warrant allows for the purchase of the number of common shares equal to the investment amount divided by the Unit price, (e.g., one warrant share for each share of common stock which the investor is eligible to receive through conversion of his original convertible note) and, the warrant will have an exercise price as set forth in the Pricing Supplement. Each Series A warrant expires June 1, 2020. The Company may  call  the Series A warrant, requiring the investor to exercise the warrant within 30 days or forever lose the rights to do so, only if the following conditions have been met: (i) the underlying Shares are registered with the SEC, and (ii) the Company s common stock closes for ten consecutive trading days at or above two times the exercise price.  
     
  In total, we issued five pricing supplements setting forth the conversion price of the note, as well as the warrant price, as follows (numbers in table reflect total investments for each pricing supplement since inception of offering through the termination of the offering):

During the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015, we received $857,000 and $1,635,000, respectively, of aggregate investments in the 2015 Unit Offering, and during the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, we received $1,405,000 and $1,940,000 respectively. A subscription for an investment in the amount of $200,000 was received and accepted prior to the close of the offering. Funds for the investment was not received until after September 30, 2016. Although the investment is included in the totals in the above table, the cash for the investment is not reflected on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. Multiple investors have chosen to convert their promissory notes into common stock (see Note 5,  Common Stock ).  
     
     One-Year Convertible Notes     
        
  On July 8, 2016,   we received $250,000 and issued convertible promissory notes (convertible at $0.45 per share) with a maturity date of July 8, 2017 to two accredited investors  in the aggregate principal amount of $280,000. Interest is charged upon issuance at 3% per annum. We also issued to the investors  stock purchase warrants to purchase an aggregate 400,000 shares exercisable at $0.65 per share, which expire five years from the date of grant. We are required to include the shares underlying the warrants in any subsequent registration statement (piggy back registration rights). Additionally, the exercise price of the stock purchase warrant may be adjusted downward in the event we sell our common stock or issue warrants at a lower price, other than through our 2015 Unit Offering. Thus, the warrants are recorded as a derivative liability on our balance sheet. The fair value of these warrants totaled $101,770 and was recorded as a derivative liability at issuance. On September 30, 2016 we again calculated the fair value of the warrants, resulting in a derivative liability of $303,880. The $202,110 was recorded as a change in fair value of a derivative liability.  
     
     Line of Credit     
         
  On June 6, 2016, we received $300,000 pursuant to a line of credit, accruing interest at a rate of 18% per annum, for which we have pledged our inventory and accounts receivable as collateral. The line of credit may be repaid following nine-months from the date of issuance or at the maturity date December 1, 2017.   
     
  Each investor, for no additional consideration, received a warrant to purchase our common stock. (See Note 6). The warrant allows for the purchase of the number of common shares equal to the investment amount. (e.g., one warrant share for each dollar invested)  .  
           
  On September 17, 2016, investors holding $250,000 of the line of credit converted their line of credit plus accrued interest of $33,571 into convertible promissory notes totaling $283,571 on the same terms and notes issued in the 2015 Unit Offering, convertible at $0.55 per share, with the exception that these newly issued notes mature September 17, 2019, rather than June 1, 2018. Additionally, the investors received a Series A stock purchase warrant to purchase 515,583 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.70 per share. (See Note 6).  
     
     December/January Notes     
     
  In January 2015, we received $133,000 and issued unsecured convertible promissory notes each with a one-year maturity date, which accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum. Each noteholder, for no additional consideration, received a stock purchase warrant exercisable at $0.30 per share, which expires January 2018. (See Note 6).  
        
  The funds received as part of our December/January Notes totaled $333,000. During the nine-month period ended December 31, 2015, these investors converted their investments into convertible promissory notes on the same terms and notes issued in the 2015 Unit Offering, convertible at $0.25 per share, maturing June 1, 2018. Additionally, the investors received a Series A stock purchase warrant to purchase 1,909,301 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.40 per share. (See Note 6).

Note 5. Stockholders  Equity    
     
     Preferred Stock      
     
  Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock, from time to time, on such terms and conditions as they shall determine. As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016 there were no outstanding shares of our preferred stock.   
     
     Common Stock      
     
  During the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we issued 1,252,339 and 1,776,664 shares of common stock in lieu of cash for salaries to officers, fees for service provided by consultants and to settle our accrued interest liability, resulting in a weighted-average grant date fair value of $530,737 and $702,743, respectively, which is recorded in selling general and administrative expense and interest expense  .  
     
  During the three-months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 1,341,301 shares of common stock per the request of noteholders  to convert the principal balance and interest due on promissory notes totaling $352,566.   There were no shares issued related to our 2015 Unit Offering during the nine-months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
  During the three-months ended September 30, 2016, we issued 1,150,000 shares of our common stock and in exchange we received proceeds totaling $355,000 from the exercise of stock purchase warrants.   There were no shares issued for the exercise of warrants during 2015.  
     
     Share-Based Compensation     
     
  During the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we recorded an aggregate $1,638,706 and $645,808 in selling general and administrative expense related to the issuance of stock options. We issued options through our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan and outside of our 2007 Equity Incentive Plan.  
     
     2007 Equity Incentive Plan      
     
  On August 7, 2007, and as amended April 29, 2011, our Board of Directors adopted the BioLargo, Inc. 2007 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2007 Plan ) as a means of providing our directors, key employees and consultants additional incentive to provide services. Both stock options and stock grants may be made under this plan. The Board s Compensation Committee administers this plan. The plan allows grants of common shares or options to purchase common shares. As plan administrator, the Compensation Committee has sole discretion to set the price of the options. The Compensation Committee may at any time amend or terminate the plan. The term of the options may be up to 10 years.  
     
  On June 20, 2016, we recorded the issuance of options to purchase an aggregate 40,000 shares of our common stock to the non-employee members of our Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the 2007 Equity Plan which calls for an annual automatic issuance. The exercise price of $0.45 equals the price of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value of these options totaled $18,000 and was recorded as selling, general and administrative expense.  
     
  On March 21, 2016, our Board of Directors extended by five years the expiration of options to purchase 307,777 shares of our common stock issued to our Board of Directors and vendors in March 2011. The options were originally issued in exchange for unpaid obligations and now expire on March 21, 2021. The weighted-average fair value of the options resulted in additional $119,971 of selling, general and administrative expenses.    
     
  On September 30, 2015, our Charles K. Dargan, II agreed to extend his engagement agreement dated February 1, 2008 (the  Engagement Agreement , which had been previously extended multiple times), pursuant to which Mr. Dargan has been serving as our Chief Financial Officer. The Engagement Extension Agreement dated as of September 30, 2015 (the  Engagement Extension Agreement ) provides for an additional term to expire September 30, 2016 (the  Extended Term ), is retroactively effective to February 1, 2015, and an extension is currently being negotiated. During the Extended Term, Mr. Dargan shall be compensated through the issuance of an option to purchase 300,000 shares of the Company s common stock that vest over the term of the engagement with 120,000 shares vested as of September 30, 2015, and the remaining shares to vest 15,000 monthly, provided that the Engagement Extension Agreement with Mr. Dargan has not been terminated prior to each vesting date. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we recorded $68,400 and $76,950 of selling, general and administrative expense.

On August 4, 2015, our board of directors extended by five years the expiration of options to purchase an aggregate 1,772,581 shares of our common stock issued to consultants, vendors and employees in August 2010. The options were originally issued in exchange for accrued and unpaid amounts owed to the individuals, at an exercise price of $0.30 and now expire August 4, 2020. Fair value of the option totaled $620,403 of additional selling, general and administrative expenses.  
     
  On June 24, 2015, we recorded the issuance of options to purchase an aggregate 40,000 shares of our common stock to the non-employee members of our Board of Directors, pursuant to the terms of the 2007 Equity Plan which calls for an annual automatic issuance. The exercise price of $0.38 equals the price of our common stock on the grant date. The fair value of these options totaled $15,200 and was recorded as selling, general and administrative expense.  
     
  On June 24, 2015, our board of directors extended by five years the expiration of an option to purchase 200,000 shares of our common stock issued to our Chief Science Officer in February 2010. The option was issued in exchange for unpaid salary obligation at an exercise price of $0.575 and now expires February 5, 2020. Fair value of the option totaled $68,000 of additional selling, general and administrative expenses.  
     
  On April 20, 2015, we issued an option to purchase 700,000 shares of our common stock to a consultant. The option vests ratably over two years, expires ten years from the date of issuance, and is exercisable at $0.40 per share. The price of our common stock on the grant date was $0.34 per share. The fair value of this option totaled $238,000 and is being expensed as selling, general and administrative expense over the vesting period. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we recorded $49,550 and $79,280 of selling, general and administrative expense. This contract ended August 2016 and the remaining unvested 262,500 options were cancelled.  
     
  Activity for our stock options under the 2007 Plan for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 is as follows:   

12

Options issued Outside of the 2007 Equity Incentive Plan     
     
  During the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, we issued options to purchase 906,973 shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging between $0.33   $0.76 per share to vendors and to our members of our board of directors, in lieu of 266,504 in accrued and unpaid fees. The weighted-average fair value of these options totaled $329,607 and is recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses.  
     
  During the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, we issued options to purchase 1,893,434 shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging between $0.33   $0.36 per share to vendors and to our members of our board of directors, in lieu of $398,150 in accrued and unpaid fees. The weighted-average fair value of these options totaled $808,615 and is recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses.  
     
  The grant-date fair value of the previously issued options that vested during the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 was $77,028 and $39,100, respectively.   
     
  Activity of our stock options issued outside of the 2007 Plan for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 is as follows:  

We recognize compensation expense for stock option awards on a straight-line basis over the applicable service period of the award, which is the vesting period. Share-based compensation expense is based on the grant date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model. The following methodology and assumptions were used to calculate share based compensation for the nine-months ended September 30:   

Expected price volatility is the measure by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the expected term of an option. Expected volatility is derived from the historical daily change in the market price of our common stock, as we believe that historical volatility is the best indicator of future volatility.   

13

The risk-free interest rate used in the Black-Scholes calculation is based on the prevailing U.S Treasury yield as determined by the U.S. Federal Reserve. We have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.   
     
  Historically, we have not had significant forfeitures of unvested stock options granted to employees and Directors. A significant number of our stock option grants are fully vested at issuance or have short vesting provisions. Therefore, we have estimated the forfeiture rate of our outstanding stock options as zero.  

Note 6. Warrants        
     
     Series A Warrants     
     
  During the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, we issued warrants to purchase up to an aggregate 4,455,413 shares of our common stock. Of this amount, warrants to purchase an aggregate 2,719,048 shares were issued at an exercise price of $0.45 per share, and warrant to purchase an aggregate 1,736,365 shares were issued at an exercise price of $0.70 per share. These warrants were issued to investors in our 2015 Unit Offering (see Note 4), as commissions to licensed brokers in conjunction therewith, and to other investors who converted their investors into notes on the same terms as the 2015 Unit Offering and Series A warrants. All Series A Warrants expire June 1, 2020. The relative fair value of these warrants resulted in $1,940,000 recorded as a discount on our convertible notes on our consolidated balance sheets in the periods presented.  
     
  Pursuant to the terms of our 2015 Unit Offering, during the nine-months ended September 30, 2015, we issued Series A warrants to purchase up to an aggregate 6,734,580 shares of our common stock. Of that amount, warrants to purchase an aggregate 6,448,866 shares were issued at an exercise price of $0.40 per share, and a warrant to purchase 285,714 shares was issued at an exercise price of $0.45 per share. These warrants were issued to investors and as commissions, and expire June 1, 2020. The fair value of the warrants and the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature resulted in an aggregate $1,635,000 discount on the convertible notes payable.  
     
     Warrants Issued Concurrently with Line of Credit     
     
  During the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate 300,000 shares of our common stock. These warrants are exercisable at $0.35 per share and expire in June 2021.     The relative fair value of warrants issued resulted in $237,405 discount on the letter of credit.  
     
   Pursuant to the terms of our line of credit, five line of credit holders exchanged their line of credit and accrued interest for notes and warrants on the terms offered in our 2015 Unit Offering totaling $283,571 (see Notes 4 and 5). With the exchange, these note holders received additional warrants to purchase an aggregate 515,583 of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.70 which expire June 1, 2018. The fair value of the warrants and the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature resulted in an aggregate $283,571 recorded as a discount on convertible notes payable.  
     
     Warrants Issued Concurrently with One Year Convertible Note        
     
  During the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate 400,000 shares of our common stock. These warrants are initially exercisable at $0.65 per share and expire July 8, 2021.     The fair value of warrants issued resulted in $101,770 discount on the one year convertible note. Additionally, the exercise price of the stock purchase warrant may be adjusted downward in the event we sell our common stock or issue warrants at a lower price, other than through our 2015 Unit Offering.  
     
     Warrants Issued Concurrently with December/January Notes     
     
  During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015, we issued warrants to purchase an aggregate 266,000 shares of our common stock to holders of our December/January notes (see Note 5). These warrants are exercisable at $0.30 per share and expire January 2020. The fair value of warrants totaled $133,000 and was recorded as interest expense.  

14

We have certain warrants outstanding to purchase our common stock, at various prices, as summarized in the following tables:  

The fair value of each award grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The determination of expense of warrants issued for services or settlement also uses the option-pricing model. The principal assumptions we used in applying this model were as follows for the nine-months ended September 30:  

The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S Treasury yields in effect at the time of grant. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock.  

Note 7. Accounts Payable and Accrued Expenses    
     
  Accounts payable and accrued expenses included the following:  

The payroll tax liability is our estimate of payroll taxes due on the past services of independent contractors. We are currently attempting to reduce the liability to approximately $5,000 through the IRS Voluntary Classification Settlement Program.  
     
  On September 27, 2016, the board approved a $120,000 bonus for our CTO and CEO, each will receive $60,000. As of September 30, 2016, $100,000 of this bonus remains to be paid.

Note 8. Noncontrolling Interest   
       
    Clyra    
     
  In May 2012, we formed a subsidiary for the purpose of marketing and selling medical products containing our technology, Clyra Medical Technology, Inc. ( Clyra ). Until December 17, 2012, this subsidiary was wholly-owned, with 7,500 shares issued to BioLargo, Inc. On December 17, 2012, Clyra issued 1,500 shares of Clyra common stock to a three member management team, one-third of which vested immediately, and the remaining over time. The shares granted to the three executives are restricted from transfer until a sale of the company, whether by means of a sale of its stock or substantially all of its assets, or otherwise by agreement of Clyra, BioLargo and the executives.  
     
  On December 30, 2015, Clyra sold 9,830 shares of its Series A Preferred Stock ( Preferred Shares ) to Sanatio Capital, LLC ( Sanatio ) for $750,000. This sale was made in reliance on the exemption from registration contained in Section 4(2) of the Securities Exchange Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder as not involving a public offering of securities. As a result of the sale, Sanatio owns 40% of Clyra s issued and outstanding shares, BioLargo owns 54%, and the remainder is owned by management.  
     
  As set forth in Clyra s Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Preferred Shares accrue an annual dividend of 8% for a period of five years. Although the dividends begin to accrue immediately, Clyra has no obligation to declare a dividend until a product of the company has received a premarket approval by the United States Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ), or for which a premarket notification pursuant to form 510(k) has been submitted and for which the FDA has given written clearance to market the product in the United States (either,  FDA Approval ). After FDA Approval, annually on December 20, and unless prohibited by California law governing distributions to shareholders, Clyra is required to declare and pay any accruing dividends to holders of Preferred Shares then accrued but unpaid. As the declaration and payment of such dividends is contingent on an uncertain future event, no liability has been recorded for the dividends. The accumulated and undeclared dividend balance as of September 30, 2016 is $45,000.   
     
  Holders of Preferred Shares are entitled to preferential payments in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the company, in an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends. After such preference, any remaining assets are distributed pro-rata between holders of Clyra common stock and Preferred Shares as if the Preferred Shares had converted to Clyra common stock. Holders of Preferred Shares may convert the shares to Clyra common stock initially on a one-to-one basis. The conversion formula is subject to change in the event Clyra sells stock at a lower price than the price paid by Sanatio.  
     
  In addition to the foregoing, Clyra entered into a consulting agreement with Beach House Consulting, LLC, through which Jack B. Strommen will be providing consulting services to the company. Mr. Strommen is the founder of Beach House Consulting, LLC. Mr. Strommen will be assisting the company in its sales and marketing activities once it has FDA Approval on a product, at which point the agreement provides that Mr. Strommen is to receive $23,438 per month for a period of four years. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not presented any products to the FDA for FDA Approval.  
     
  Clyra has yet to generate revenues. Clyra s operations for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, resulted in a net loss of $151,333 and $415,380, respectively.  
     
    Biolargo Maritime Solutions    
       
  The Company has an additional subsidiary, Biolargo Maritime Solutions, whereby if certain factors are met, a noncontrolling equity interest in this subsidiary has been pledged to its management.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.   
     
   Our Business   
     
  We make life better delivering sustainable technology-based products that help solve some of the most widespread problems threatening the world's supply of water, food, agriculture, healthcare and energy. We create and refine intellectual property that forms a foundation from which to build and create break-through products and technology for licensure to commercial partners. Our products harness the power of iodine    Nature's Best Solution    to eliminate contaminants that threaten our water, our health and our quality of life.  
     
  We  invent, patent, prove and partner    to create best-of-class products and technology for commercialization as we build value for our shareholders and deliver benefits to our world.   
     
    Invent   Three Platform Technologies    
     
  We feature three patent protected platform technologies with diverse product opportunities across multiple industries   the AOS (Advanced Oxidation System), CupriDyne, and Isan. Each features the use of the all-natural iodine molecule. While they all use iodine, they are quite different in terms of the methods by which they exploit the use of iodine, the form and composition of iodine used, and therefore their function and value proposition can be quite different for each commercial application.   
     
    BioLargo s AOS (Advanced Oxidation System)    
     
  The AOS is our invention that combines iodine, water filter materials and electricity within a water treatment device. Our AOS generates extremely high oxidation potential within the device to achieve extremely high rates of disinfection to eliminate infectious biological pathogens like  S  almonella   enterica ,  L  isteria   monocytogenes  and  Escherichia coli,  as well as a model virus Bacteriophage T4. It is also able to oxidize and break-down, or otherwise eliminate, soluble organic contaminants like acids, solvents, sulfur compounds, oil and gas by-products, and pharmaceutical by-products commonly found in a wide variety of contaminated water sources. The AOS  extremely high oxidation potential, generated using extremely low levels of energy is the key.  
     
  The term  oxidation potential  refers to the measure of the performance by which an oxidant is able to  break down  a material through removing electrons, and sometimes by the addition of oxygen. Two commonly understood examples of oxidation are: the rusting of a shipyard anchor by salty air, and the breakdown and conversion of wood into ash by fire and oxygen. The key to our AOS is its ability to generate extremely high oxidation potential in a continuous flow device that attacks contaminants in water flowing through it. The extremely high oxidation potential enables the AOS to achieve disinfection performance results that some researchers at the University of Alberta refer to as     unprecedented    . Aside from its measurably superior disinfection rates, the AOS Filter also boasts substantially lower power consumption rates than competing advanced water treatment technologies such as UV, electro-chlorination, or ozonation. For some applications, it is this value proposition that sets the AOS technology above other water treatment options, as the AOS may allow safe and reliable water treatment for a fraction of the cost of its competitors, and may even enable advanced water treatment in applications where it would have otherwise been prohibitively costly. Our AOS embodies a break-through in science which led to BioLargo's co-founding of an ongoing research chair whose goal is to solve the contaminated water issues associated with the Canadian Oil Sands at the University of Alberta Department of Engineering in conjunction with the top five oil companies in Canada, the regional water district, and various environmental agencies of the Canadian government. Our work is continually expanding into a number of commercial applications with a key focus on food processing, agriculture, and oil and gas. We are also at the early stages of pursuing opportunities in the maritime industry. We are evaluating new opportunities in the storm drain recapture / recycling, and drinking water. Our AOS is an award-winning invention that is supported by science and engineering financial support and grants from various federal and provincial funding agencies in Canada. Financial support is expanding concurrently with ongoing work to commercially develop the latest AOS designs. We believe the AOS has an important and substantial commercial opportunity in every segment of the water treatment industry.   
     
  Following extensive validation testing and refinement of the basic operating system, we have begun a commercial prototype development project, the next step leading to a product ready for commercial markets. The project is being executed in collaboration with technical personnel at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT)'s Center for Sensors and Systems Integration and with NAIT's Applied Bio/Nanotechnology Industrial Research Chair. Bolstered by financial support provided by the Alberta Innovates nanoPDP program, this project is focused on the development of a first-generation prototype system that incorporates a sensor platform to monitor various water parameters through online real-time data acquisition. The first  Alpha  prototype of the AOS was delivered at our annual technical symposium this past August. This Alpha AOS system enables further scale up and testing in industrial settings and work has commenced to develop a  Beta  unit for first stage commercial trials. Once this Beta prototype development phase is complete, we intend to focus on producing multiple commercial ready pilot units for testing with various interested industrial clients and on securing regulatory approvals where required.

Our AOS is being developed as a flexible modular system to allow for a wide variety of sizes, configurations and functional uses to be deployed to meet a wide variety of unique and special requirements of customers across a wide range of industries.   
     
    CupriDyne  Technology    
     
  Our CupriDyne technology is used to efficiently deliver iodine in various products. It can be delivered in any physical form, and can be combined with other ingredients such as fragrances in our odor control products, and surfactants in our stain removal and odor control products. Additional ingredients can often be added without sacrificing its practical and safe functions as well its oxidation potential  . Our product designs include liquids, sprays, gels, powders, coatings and absorbents.   
     
  Safety and efficacy are key for CupriDyne. Each of our product designs delivers iodine safely, and precisely, to achieve effective odor control, stain-removal, or surface washing, and in some applications at high doses, broad-spectrum disinfection. CupriDyne s primary ingredients, as well as reaction by-products, are  generally recognized as safe  (G.R.A.S) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as food additives in their basic forms. CupriDyne s commercial product opportunities are diverse and we have an extensive menu of product designs in various stages of commercialization and licensure development, discussed in detail below in the  Commercial, Household and Personal Care Products  section. We specialize in delivering iodine, nature s broadest spectrum and most potent disinfectant, odor eliminator, oxidizer, catalyst, and essential nutrient, in safe, environmentally friendly, non-staining, non-toxic and effective product designs.  
     
  CupriDyne is unique. The iodine most of us are familiar with, sold in pharmacies and used by hospitals, has severe limitations   it is considered toxic, causes staining, and contains a limited dose of the active oxidizing ingredient. Our CupriDyne technology, on the other hand, directly addresses many of these shortcomings. It delivers iodine s oxidizing ingredient ( free iodine ) with precision, ranging from very small doses up to very large doses with more than 30 times the performance of traditional chlorine. We can deliver iodine that is both non-toxic and non-staining, thus extending its usefulness well beyond historical product applications.   
     
  Our CupriDyne technology is flexible, allowing product designs to incorporate varying dosing levels. Some product designs focus on odor, and do not act as "disinfectants". Some product designs do, and would require regulatory approval to make such claims.  
     
    Isan System    
     
  The Isan System is a reliable and efficient automated iodine dosing system. It is the winner of a Top 50 Water Technology Award by the Artemis Project and a Dupont Innovation Award. Its precise dosing combined with a straight-forward  set-it-and-forget-it  automated computer controlled system are the keys to its success. The system features controlled measuring, flow rate, dosing and iodine extraction/removal technology as well as an automatic tracking system that precisely delivers iodine in calibrated doses into a water steam or container of water. The Isan system has been proven to substantially reduce the incidence of fungal growth, spoilage, microorganisms and pathogens in water and on food. The system is capable of functioning at the high flow rates commensurate with industrial disinfection needs.   
     
  First developed in Australia, the Isan system was initially registered with the APVMA (Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority) and FSANZ (Food Standards Australia and New Zealand) in Australia and New Zealand. The system has meaningful applications and commercial value in any industry that can benefit from precise and effective dosing of iodine in water, such as: agriculture, food production and processing, manufacturing, industrial water processes, and irrigation supply.

Patent - an Expanding Intellectual Property Estate    
     
  We have 16 patents issued and multiple pending. We believe these patents provide a foundation from which to continue building our patent portfolio and we have reasonable basis upon which to rely on our patent protections in the field of art in which we practice  . We also rely on trade secrets and technical know-how to establish and maintain additional protection of our intellectual property. As our capital resources permit, we expect to expand our patent protection as we continue to refine our inventions as well as make new discoveries. See the detailed discussion below of our patent portfolio.  
     
    Prove - a Continual Process    
     
  We have invested time and money in a wide array of third party testing, side-by-side comparisons and third party verifications to support our most important technical claims.

    Partner   a Smart Strategic Decision     
     
  We seek to develop commercial partnerships with other companies who will partner with us and pay us for a negotiated contractual right to use our intellectual property (patents, formulas, designs, claims, know-how, secrets), in order to expand their business for their own commercial purposes. In those instances, we seek a reasonable deposit, a minimum commitment to volume, some territorial rights, and a percentage of sales for a mutually agreeable term and territory. We believe this licensing model will prove successful and meaningful for our company.   
     
  We have chosen to focus on business opportunities that we believe have some combination of the following attributes: a compelling commercial advantage, our products out-perform competing products, market segments in which we have the talent and resources or opportunity to succeed in executing our business plans; and uses where we can identify a compelling cost savings or value offering to increase market share.   
     
  We choose to pursue a licensing strategy for its obvious and well-understood high margins, potential for explosive revenue potential and capital conserving features. While this business model can also be highly dependent upon macro-economic factors like the relative stability of the national and international economy as well as cyclical nature of business, politics and climate for innovation and competing technical advances, we believe this is the most appropriate strategy for our company. We have learned from difficult real-life experiences. When our commercial licensing partners are under financial pressure from macro-economic and political circumstances, including reorganizations, recapitalization, or consolidation, they hold on to capital and are less likely to take any risk for new product offerings. Timing is critically important. Companies facing circumstances beyond their management s control are less likely to embrace any risk of innovation. Therefore, our time delays have negatively impacted our company by causing us to invest more capital, do more work, and advance our technology with nominal cash flow to support our work. However, while these delays have occurred and they were difficult, we have been able to maintain our operations, advance our scientific assets, build on our proven claims, refine our designs and we have continued to build a portfolio of both products and technology that we believe will ultimately enjoy meaningful commercial success.   
     
  While we have waited out many of the uncertainties of the macro-economic marketplace, we have advanced our commercial purposes and made investments in various aspects of product design, marketing and distribution, but only at an early stage and small level. In those instances, we consider these efforts to be a prelude to an ultimate licensing strategy. This strategy has been slower than we prefer. However, it has created a substantial level of diversification and breadth of potential revenue streams that we believe can and will generate meaningful revenues as they find traction in the marketplace. As we improve our access to capital, strengthen our balance sheet and can begin to generate meaningful cash flow, we believe those commercial opportunities will generate revenue for years to come as our products find their way into the marketplace.  
     
  In many situations, our potential licensing partners would prefer that we advance products all the way through proof of claim, manufacturing, market acceptance, well-established distribution and commercial success. While this is obvious, can be intriguing, and the relative benefits that would accrue to our valuation are clear, the risks of failure are equally high and this strategy would require substantially more capital than we have been able to secure during what many believe has been one of the most economically uncertain times in modern history. Therefore, we have chosen to invest our time and resources where we find leverage to move forward, knowing that our technical claims are proven, they are patented and that each product design has a high probability of success to find a partner and generate meaningful returns on our invested capital as our targeted licensing partners seek to deploy capital assets and begin taking advantage of our offering for their own commercial advancements.  
     
  Although our technology has commercial applications within many industries, we are focusing our efforts in four areas: water treatment; industrial odor control applications; commercial, household and personal care products ( CHAPP  and  advanced wound care.   

22

Within these broad categories, we also narrow our product focus to exploit opportunities that we believe are of high-value to potential customers and that present commercially significant opportunities.  
     
  We have a number of examples of strategic alliance or partnering initiatives whereby we are advancing both our science, our patents, our proof of claims, field trials and our commercial opportunities. There are a number of noteworthy examples:   
     
    The University of Alberta    
     
  We are engaged in a cooperative research relationship with the University of Alberta and its researchers in Edmonton, Canada. The offices and lab of our Canadian subsidiary, BioLargo Water, Inc., and our staff researchers, are located within the University of Alberta research center at Agri-Food Discovery Place. We are able to utilize the extensive resources of the University and its researchers on a contract for hire basis as needed. We work closely with the Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Science at the University of Alberta and its Department of Engineering, and partner with University professors on government and industry sponsored financial awards and grants to support our ongoing research and development as we refine the AOS in preparation of commercial pilots and commercial designs. Generally, the financial awards take on two common themes: first, science and engineering grants in which the University of Alberta is the primary recipient and contracting party with the grant agency to support work on and around our technology; and second, direct grants in which our Canadian subsidiary is the contracting party to support ongoing science and engineering to advance our AOS towards commercialization, sometimes supporting the work of PhD students at the University. In both cases, the financial awards support much, but not all, of the research budget and related costs. Our research arrangement with the University has three high value propositions for BioLargo: (i) a depth of resources and talent to accomplish highly skilled work, (ii) financial aid to support research and development costs, and (iii) independent and credible validation of our technical claims.  
     
    Clarion Water    
     
  On August 18, 2014, we entered into a manufacturing and distribution license agreement for our Isan  system with Clarion Water, a new operating division of InsulTech Manufacturing, LLC (www.insultech.com), the latter of which has over 20 years of commercial success around the globe representing hundreds of millions in sales of technical products to Fortune 100 companies.  
     
  Owned in equal parts by BioLargo, Inc. and Peter Holdings, Ltd. through a joint venture agreement, the Isan system leverages the power of iodine to provide the world s most effective disinfection dosing systems. It has been referred to as one of the most important technical advancements in food safety in the past 20 years. It won a  top 50 water company award  by the Artemis Project in 2010 and a DuPont Innovation Award for its excellence in science and innovation in 2004.  
     
  The Isan system delivers iodine as a powerful, broad-spectrum biocide that is a logical replacement for chlorine in many applications.  Through its automated and precise dosing system, the Isan system can help increase the quality and shelf life of fruits, vegetables, and other produce, is effective against a host of bacteria and fungi, and helps producers conform to increasingly stringent food safety regulations such as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), which addresses food safety through the analysis and control of raw material hazards.  
     
  The Isan system has been validated through early stage commercialization and comprehensive testing conducted in Australia and New Zealand. Clarion intends to leverage this early work and focus initial commercialization efforts on the vast opportunities for the technology in improving plant quality and shelf life as well as explore additional opportunities for use in select industrial applications.   
     
  Per the terms of our original license agreement, Clarion received the exclusive global manufacturing and distribution rights to the Isan system and use of all historical data to support its commercial focus. Clarion agreed to pay BioLargo royalties on revenue equal to 10% paid quarterly in arrears. As we jointly own the Isan System with Peter Holdings, Ltd., all royalties are shared equally with Peter Holdings. There are no minimum royalty payments for the first two years, but at year three (beginning July 1, 2016), to maintain exclusive rights, the minimum royalties are $50,000 per quarter, at year four $75,000 per quarter, and at year five and onward $100,000 per quarter. The intellectual property subject to the license agreement includes all intellectual property related to the Isan System, including all patents, trademarks, proprietary knowledge, and other similar know-how or rights relating to or arising out of the Isan System or the patents related to the Isan System. The agreement contains other terms and conditions typically found in intellectual property license agreements.   

23

BioLargo received a royalty advance of $100,000 upon execution of a letter of intent in February of 2014. Of this advance, $45,000 was paid to Peter Holdings under our joint venture agreement. BioLargo retains certain marketing rights to help develop clients for Clarion.  
     
  Since licensing the technology from BioLargo in August 2014, Clarion has completed a comprehensive technical and engineering update to the Isan System, featuring a new automated touch screen user interface, enhanced security, enhanced control features for increased monitoring and sensing, and adding automated functionality providing users unmatched flexibility, reliability and control over this state-of-the-art disinfectant delivery system, and begun commercial trials. In 2016, it received its first U.S. Environmental Protection Agency approval, for use of Isan generated iodine,  BioMax A , as it is delivered in poultry drinking water. Clarion has begun the process of expanding the approved uses under its EPA registration.   
     
  Clarion continues to pursue commercial opportunities for the Isan system. They have recently identified two distributors to work with directly to establish sales and customer trials. BioLargo and Peter Holdings have agreed to cooperate as Clarion more narrowly and precisely determines its commercial focus. Clarion has further offered to serve as a manufacturer of the Isan system for business opportunities that may develop for BioLargo in the future. While it narrows its commercial focus, Clarion has determined not to make further minimum payments under the license agreement and is operating on a non-exclusive basis. This election does not affect Clarion s obligation to pay royalties on sales.   
     
     Downeast Logistics     
     
  In late 2013, we entered into a cooperative selling and distribution agreement with Downeast Logistics, a certified  Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business  (SDVOSB), as our distribution partner to facilitate our first order to the US Government. Downeast has been instrumental in developing ongoing sales to the United States Military. We have six products with National Stocking Numbers.   
     
  In March 2016 two of our product lines (consisting of 9 SKUs) of Nature s Best Science products were awarded a five-year U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) supply contract, under schedule 65IIA for medical equipment and supplies. The award opens up access to these products through  GSA Advantage , the online shopping and ordering system that provides government agencies access to thousands of contractors and millions of supplies (products) and services. We intend to apply for inclusion of additional existing and future products into GSA Advantage, including our industrial odor control product, CupriDyne Clean.  
     
  Downeast Logistics has operated for more than thirteen years, and will continue to offer our products through multiple channels of the US Government. Its designation as a SDVOSB places Downeast Logistics within a group of highly sought after vendors to the US government. Odor-No-More has registered, and is in the process of registering, itself as well as its products with several procurement agencies of the US Government.   
     
     Industrial Odor Control - CupriDyne Clean        
     
  Late last year, we were invited by a number of potential customers to design a product for the industrial odor control industry segment and to begin trials for an odor control product in large-scale operations. As a result of these efforts, we have branded a product  CupriDyne Clean , a non-staining and colorless blend of micronutrients designed for odor control. CupriDyne Clean has proven extremely effective at oxidizing volatile organic compounds (gases), while maintaining its low cost, safety and easy to use features. It is dispensed through atomization systems, portable sprayers and water trucks. CupriDyne Clean is highly effective at eliminating odorous gases, and is safe for use on a host of surfaces including the air, soils, metals, concrete and asphalt, docks, floors, walls, feed and water receptacles, waste receptacles, tanks, bins, liners and dumpsters. It can be delivered with or without fragrances since fragrances are not required for it to achieve odor elimination. The product is available in liquids and powders offered in various sizes for industrial uses and is ideal for waste transfer stations, composting facilities, landfill operations, sewage plants and lift stations, food processing plants and animal enclosures. In principle, any operations that must contend with gaseous odors generated from organic matter and decay, including the natural release of VOCs from this decay, can benefit by using CupriDyne Clean. Existing and prospective customers, as well as experts from these markets, tell us that effective odor control for these prospective customer groups is among the top on a list of priorities in their daily operations and their commitment to serve their local communities where they operate.      

24

Our sales and marketing activities of CupriDyne Clean are increasing. We continue to further develop and refine our free trial program, attend industry conferences, join trade associations, advertise, and recruit leaders from these industries to help us refine, focus and break through to commercial success. In May 2016, we secured our first orders for CupriDyne Clean for the use at a Southern California waste handling facility. We now have multiple customers and continue to expand our free trial program and develop new agents and distributor relationships to expand sales. The response from our trial work with potential customers tell us that the product works better than any product they have used and is cost effective. They all indicate a desire to purchase and use the product. As exciting and validating as these trials are, we are still required to navigate what can sometimes be a time consuming and laborious task to bring trial customers into a final completed purchase order. While we have enjoyed early success, there is much work under way to finalize a number of prospective customers including some of the largest multi-national customer targets and municipalities. These efforts are time consuming and continuing. We are confident that this product will continue to win customers.   
     
     Multinationals and Mid-Level Industry Participants     
     
  We held our first technical symposium in August 2015 where we had more than 30 attendees representing industry, academia and funding agencies. We held a second technical symposium in August of 2016 to showcase the refinements to the technology, data showing efficacy, our  Alpha  AOS filter, and our first commercial prototype being designed and assembled by the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology. We have entered into technical non-disclosure agreements multi-national and regional companies to evaluate our AOS and discuss potential strategic alliances. Many of these companies continue to monitor our technical progress and have expressed interest in the technology and potential strategic alliances as we finalize our commercially ready design. The claims we have put forth are well received.  The focus of discussions in most cases has moved from efficacy, which is accepted, to a business case discussion relative to capital and time to market and the potential return on investment. While these discussions are ongoing we continue to advance our science and proven claims. We are highly encouraged that AOS has an important role in commerce.  
     
     Commercial, Household and Personal Care Products     
     
  CHAPP includes broad product categories and many opportunities for the application of our technologies. It is defined by the ability to utilize similar, if not identical, consumption products in multiple market segments. Detergents, single use absorbents, wipes, products that provide odor or infection control, and stain removal all fall within this category. Packaging ranges from consumer sizes of a few ounces to bulk packaging for commercial or industrial use. We are currently marketing products in this category under four brands   Odor-No-More, Nature s Best Solution, Deodorall, and NBS.   
     
  We are continuing our efforts to generate  private label  clients. We are continuing to fulfill small orders for various products that we produced under a third party s private brand. We are meeting with new potential customers for private label opportunities. We have had discussions with potential strategic alliance partners to provide large scale manufacturing and distribution should we secure orders for the private label business opportunities, and can revisit those relationships as opportunities present themselves. We have a few opportunities that could expand to become large customers for our company. Success in these markets is highly dependent upon the willingness of the potential partners to invest in product support to continue marketing and expanding customer awareness.   
     
  Our sales in the CHAPP product category are nominal. Product development, sales, and marketing require significant financial resources that we currently have elected to invest elsewhere while, also, limiting our risk in these highly competitive and commodity markets.. As such, our progress in this area has been slower than we had hoped. We are marketing the technology for licensure to established companies in this industry segment, as the opportunities present themselves through our various independent agents and our key industry contacts, and we are continuing to expand our proof of claims and product designs for various odor and moisture control applications.

Advanced Wound Care   Clyra Medical Technologies Subsidiary     
     
  In 2012 we formed a subsidiary Clyra Medical Technologies, Inc. ( Clyra ) to commercialize our technology in the medical products industry, with an initial focus on advanced wound care. Our advanced wound care products combine broad-spectrum antimicrobial capabilities with iodine s natural and well-understood metabolic pathway to promote healing. Our products are highly differentiated by the gentle nature in which they can perform. We believe these benefits, along with its non-staining feature and reduced product costs as compared with other antimicrobials, give our products a competitive advantage in the marketplace.  
     
  In December 2015, we completed a financing transaction through which $750,000 was invested into Clyra in exchange for preferred stock comprising 40% of the total issued and outstanding shares. The investor committed to fund a $5,000,000 operating line of credit once Clyra s initial products receive FDA Approval.   
     
  With new funding in place, Clyra re-initiated product development and testing for its wound gel and wound treatment products with experts and well established contract manufacturing companies from industry. It intends to apply for FDA 510(k) approval for these two products to be sold into the advanced wound care industry as soon as product development is complete. While no assurances can be made about the ultimate success any FDA applications once filed, given the forward-looking nature of such events, Clyra has retained and engaged a team of experts in the area to guide it through the process.  Given the timing of the FDA process, and the requirement for approval before product can be sold, we do not anticipate product sales until 2017. To date we have successfully formulated a number of product designs that we believe can meet the tests required for FDA approval and are working to conclude those technical validations now. In the interim, we will continue to refine our products, their roll out, marketing, and distribution plans. Where possible, we are continuing to expand patent coverage for the products in development. We are also evaluating potential product designs where our current product designs can be used or slightly modified/ enhanced to create new products for new medial related markets like dental, veterinary medicine, over the counter applications and the like.   
     
     BioLargo Maritime Solutions, Inc.      
     
  We formed BioLargo Maritime Solutions, Inc. to organize and evaluate business opportunities in and around the maritime industry for our technologies, including our AOS. We intend to move forward as we are actively developing key relationships with people, service organizations, suppliers and trade groups that serve this industry. We will need to organize a strategy and additional resources, including capital and proper staffing to pursue business opportunities in and around the maritime industry that would incorporate BioLargo technologies. This subsidiary is not yet operational.  
           
   Results of Operations Comparison of the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
     
     Revenue     
        
  Our revenue from product sales totaled $107,321 and $160,249 in the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $43,335 and $72,821 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. In calendar year 2016, our revenues have increased each quarter, from $13,942 in first quarter, to $38,986 in second quarter, to $107,321 in the third quarter. These increases are due to an increase in the volume of sales of, primarily, our Specimen Transport Solidifier pouches and Suction Canister Solidifiers to the U.S. Defense Logistics Agency, our CupriDyne Clean industrial odor control product to the waste management industry, and our Odor-No-More branded animal bedding additive to horse stables and equine products retailers.   
   
  While we are highly encouraged about the increases in the volume of sales of our odor control products, as well as feedback from our customers and potential customers, we are not yet able to forecast future sales of any single product or product category on a quarterly basis, especially in the short term. As we complete more successful customer trials and selling history over time, we believe that sales of our CupriDyne Clean products in particular, will expand and become more predictable, as will our selling experience with all of our odor control products. Therefore, until we have more sales history and experience in these markets, we will not be able to predict future sales revenue, and we may experience quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and volatility in the rate of increase and consistency of sales.   
        
  During the three-months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded as Royalty revenue a portion ($55,000) of the $100,000 deposit received (in 2014) from the license of our ISAN system. The $100,000 deposit was offset by $45,000 paid to Peter Holdings Pty. Ltd. (see Part II, Item 2, "Clarion Water").  

26

Other Income        
     
  During the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, income received from Canadian grant agencies increased $10,349 and $55,397 over the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015. Since January 2015, we have received approximately $210,000 in direct grant funds. Our wholly owned Canadian subsidiary has been awarded a total of 30 research grants, primarily from the Canadian National Research Institute   Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC-IRAP) and the National Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC). The government grants received are considered reimbursement grants related to costs we incur and therefore are included as Other Income on our income statement. The total value of grants awarded from inception through November 14, 2016 is approximately $1,100,000 Canadian dollars. Of that amount, we will receive approximately $380,000 in total, and are required to dedicate approximately $290,000 in cash support. The remainder of grant funds will be paid directly to third parties. We continue to apply for grants to support our research and development activities in Canada, and expect grant income to continue.     
     
     Cost of Goods Sold     
     
  Our cost of goods sold includes costs of raw materials, contract manufacturing, and proportions of salaries and expenses related to the sales and marketing efforts of our products. Because we have not achieved a meaningful product revenue base, and our number of products is increasing, the inclusion of the fixed costs related to the product development and manufacturing increases our cost of goods disproportionately, resulting in high percentage fluctuations.  
     
     Selling, General and Administrative Expense      
        
  Our Selling, General and Administrative ("SG A") expenses include both cash and non-cash expenses. Our total SG A decreased by $466,027 (32%) and $31,349 (1%) in the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same periods in 2015. The decrease is due primarily to a non-cash expense incurred in 2015 associated with the extension of the expiration dates of stock options issued in 2011.   
        
  The largest components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 were:   

Research and Development      
     
  Research and development expenses increased $186,359 (115%) and $562,166 (120%) for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015. For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, we spent over $1,000,000 on our research and development activities. In December 2015, $750,000 was invested into our subsidiary Clyra Medical Technologies for the purpose of concluding the development of its advanced wound care products. The increase in research and development expenses is a result of increased activity at Clyra due to this investment, and increased activities at our research facility at the University of Alberta due in part to an increase in grant funding.  
        
     Interest expense      
     
  Interest expense increased $840,268 and $1,408,045 for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015. Our interest expense increased significantly because of the increase in outstanding promissory notes and the amortization of the discount on the warrants issued in our 2015 Unit Offering. At the start of 2015, we had only $250,000 in outstanding promissory notes. This number increased by almost $3,000,000 during 2015 and as of the date of this report we have more than $5,000,000 in convertible notes payable on which we are paying interest.   

27

Net Loss      
     
  Net loss for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,484,103 and $5,796,831, a loss of $0.03 and $0.07 per share, compared to a net loss for the three and nine-months ended September 30, 2015 of $1,823,252 and $3,818,338, a loss of $0.02 and $0.05 per share. The increase in net loss is primarily due to the increase in interest expense related to the amortization of the discount recorded on our convertible notes payable and an increase in research and development expenses.   
        
   Liquidity and Capital Resources    
     
  We have been, and anticipate that we will continue to be, limited in terms of our capital resources. Until we are successful in commercializing products or negotiating and securing payments for licensing rights of our technologies, we expect to continue to have operating losses. Cash totaled $1,731,946 at September 30, 2016. We had working capital of $1,041,864 as of September 30, 2016, compared with working capital of $266,086   as of September 30, 2015. During the nine-months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, we used cash flow from operating activities of $1,340,139 and $2,799,096, respectively. The significant increase in cash expended was in large part due to increased research and development activity, and our ability to pay our employees, consultants and vendors in cash, rather than stock, as a result of our increased capital on hand.   
     
  The differences from period-to-period in our net cash used in operating activities are dependent on our cash position during the period. If we have sufficient cash reserves from financing activities, we typically pay employees and vendors a larger portion in cash. This was the case in the nine-months ended September 30, 2016. Otherwise, we issue common stock or options to purchase common stock to compensate employees and vendors the remainder of what they are owed. We do so at the end of the quarter. When we issue options, we do so pursuant to a plan adopted by our board of directors that allows us to set a price based on the trading price of our common stock. The options we issue have a fair value greater than the cash owed, and that fact increases our non-cash expense.  
     
  We generally have not had enough cash or sources of capital to fully fund operations or accounts payable and expenses as they arise. The short-term demands on our liquidity consist of our obligations to pay our employees, consultants, and for other ongoing operational obligations, including research and development activities in Canada and in our medical subsidiary. In the past, because we had limited capital available, we have paid only a portion of these obligations in cash, and the remainder by the issuance of common stock or options pursuant to the accounts payable conversion plan approved by our board of directors. We will be required to raise substantial additional capital to expand our operations, including without limitation, hiring additional personnel, additional scientific and third-party testing, costs associated with obtaining regulatory approvals and filing additional patent applications to protect our intellectual property, and possible strategic acquisitions or alliances, as well as to meet our liabilities as they become due for the next 12 months. We have been, and will continue to be, required to financially support the operations our subsidiaries, none of which are operating at a positive cash flow. Only one subsidiary, Clyra, has financing in place to fund operations for the remainder of the year.   
     
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of our business. As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, we had a net loss of $5,796,831 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, and an accumulated stockholders  deficit of $89,680,852 as of September 30, 2016. The foregoing factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Ultimately, our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to attract significant new sources of capital, attain a reasonable threshold of operating efficiencies and achieve profitable operations by licensing or otherwise commercializing products incorporating our technologies. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had $5,447,876 in principal amounts due on various debt obligations (see Note 4). Of that amount, $4,834,305 is due on notes convertible into shares of our common stock at our option on their maturity dates on June 1, 2018, $283,571 is convertible into shares of our common stock at our option on their maturity dates on September 17, 2019, and $280,000, maturing July 8, 2017, is convertible by the holder at any time. We also had $50,000 principal amount outstanding due on a line of credit that is payable December 1, 2017. Interest continues to accrue on each of these notes. Additionally, we had $290,076 of accounts payable and accrued expenses (see Note 7).  

28

We are continuing to explore numerous alternatives for our current and longer-term financial requirements, including additional raises of capital from investors in the form of convertible debt or equity. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any additional capital. No commitments are in place as of the date of the filing of this report for any such additional financings.   
     
  It is also unlikely that we will be able to qualify for bank or other financial institutional debt financing until such time as our operations are considerably more advanced and we are able to demonstrate the financial strength to provide confidence for a lender, which we do not currently believe is likely to occur for at least the next 12 months or more.   
     
  If we are unable to raise sufficient capital, we may be required to curtail some of our operations, including efforts to develop, test, market, evaluate and license our BioLargo technology. If we were forced to curtail aspects of our operations, there could be a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  
     
   Critical Accounting Policies     
     
  Our unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the   United States of America. Preparation of these statements requires management to make judgments and estimates. Some accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in these financial statements. A summary of significant accounting policies and a description of accounting policies that are considered critical may be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Critical Accounting Estimates sections. In addition, refer to Note 2 to the consolidated interim financial statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.  
     
  The methods, estimates and judgments the Company uses in applying these most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results of the Company reports in its financial statements.   
     
  It the Company s policy to expense share based payments as of the date of grant in accordance with Auditing Standard Codification Topic 718  Share-Based Payment.  Application of this pronouncement requires significant judgment regarding the assumptions used in the selected option pricing model, including stock price volatility and employee exercise behavior. Most of these inputs are either highly dependent on the current economic environment at the date of grant or forward-looking expectations projected over the expected term of the award. As a result, the actual impact of adoption on future earnings could differ significantly from our current estimate.

Item 4.    
 
   Controls and Procedures       
     
  We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of the end of the period covered by this Report.   
     
  Our procedures have been designed to ensure that the information relating to our company, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that as of the evaluation date our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.   
     
  It should be noted that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.  
     
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 4.1   
     
   SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT

In connection with any transfer of Securities other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or Rule 144 (as defined below), to the Company or to an affiliate of the applicable Investor, the Company may require the transferor thereof to provide to the Company an opinion of counsel selected by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration of such transferred Securities under the 1933 Act. Each Investor understands that the Securities, except as set forth below, may bear any legends as required by applicable state securities or  Blue Sky  laws in addition to a restrictive legend in substantially the following form (and a stop-transfer order may be placed against transfer of such stock certificates):   
     
  [NEITHER THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE [CONVERTIBLE] [EXERCISABLE] HAVE BEEN][THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN] REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE HOLDER (IF REQUESTED BY THE COMPANY), IN A FORM REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD OR ELIGIBLE TO BE SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.  
     
  The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its transfer agent to remove the legend set forth above and to issue a certificate without such legend to the holder of the Securities upon which it is stamped, or to issue to such holder by electronic delivery at the applicable balance account at the Depository Trust Company (   DTC   ), unless otherwise required by state securities or  blue sky  laws, at such time as (i) such Securities are registered for resale under the 1933 Act, (ii) in connection with a sale, assignment or other transfer, such holder provides the Company with an opinion of counsel, in a form generally acceptable to the Company s legal counsel, to the effect that such sale, assignment or transfer of the Securities may be made without registration under the 1933 Act, or (iii) such holder provides the Company and its legal counsel with reasonable assurance in writing that the Securities can be sold, assigned or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 or Rule 144A. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company agrees that, following the effective date of a registration statement covering the resale of such Securities or at such time as such legend is not required pursuant to this Section 4.4, the Company shall, no later than three Trading Days following the delivery by the Investor to the Company or the Company s transfer agent of a certificate representing the Warrant Shares, as applicable, issued with a restrictive legend (such third Trading Day, the    Legend Removal Date   ), either: (A) issue and deliver (or cause to be issued and delivered) to such Investor a certificate representing such Warrant Shares that is free from all restrictive and other legends or (B) cause the Company s transfer agent to credit such Investor s or its designee s account at DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (DWAC) system with a number of Common Shares equal to the number of Warrant Shares represented by the certificate so delivered by such Investor. If the Company fails on or prior to the Legend Removal Date to either (i) issue and deliver (or cause to be issued and delivered) to such Investor a certificate representing the Warrant Shares that is free from all restrictive and other legends or (ii) cause the Company s transfer agent to credit the balance account of such Investor or its designee at DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (DWAC) system with a number of Common Shares equal to the number of Warrant Shares represented by the certificate delivered by such Investor pursuant hereto, then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Investor, the Company shall pay in cash to the Investor on each day after the Legend Removal Date that the issuance or credit of such shares is not timely effected an amount equal to 1.0% of the product of (A) the sum of the number of Warrant Shares not issued to such Investor on a timely basis and to which such Investor is entitled and (B) the VWAP for the five Trading Day period immediately preceding the Legend Removal Date. In addition to the foregoing, if the Company fails to so properly deliver such unlegended certificates or so properly credit the account of such Investor or its designee at DTC by the Legend Removal Date, and if on or after the Legend Removal Date such Investor purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) Common Shares to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Investor of Warrant Shares that such Investor anticipated receiving from the Company without any restrictive legend, then the Company shall, within three Trading Days after such Investor s request, pay cash to such Investor in an amount equal to such Investor s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the Common Shares so purchased, at which point the Company s obligation to deliver a certificate or credit such Investor s or its designee s account at DTC for such Warrant Shares shall terminate and such shares shall be cancelled.

No executive officer or other key employee of the Company is, or is now expected to be, in violation of any material term of any employment contract, confidentiality, disclosure or proprietary information agreement, non-competition agreement, or any other contract or agreement or any restrictive covenant, and the continued employment of each such executive officer or other key employee (as the case may be) does not subject the Company to any liability with respect to any of the foregoing matters. The Company is in compliance with all federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations respecting labor, employment and employment practices and benefits, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, except where failure to be in compliance would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

The execution, delivery and performance by the Investor of this Agreement and the consummation by the Investor of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (i) result in a violation of the organizational documents of the Investor or (ii) conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, any agreement, indenture or instrument to which the Investor is a party, or (iii) result in a violation of any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree (including federal and state securities or  Blue Sky  laws) applicable to the Investor, except in the case of clause (ii) above, for such conflicts, defaults or rights which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Investor to perform its obligations hereunder.

The payments to which the Investor shall be entitled pursuant to this Section 8 are referred to herein as    Rule 144       Failure Payments  .

  3.      CONVERSION OF NOTE .     This Note shall be convertible into shares of the Company's Common Stock, on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3.  
     
  a.      Conversion Right . Subject to the provisions of Section 3(c), at any time or from time to time, the Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding and unpaid Conversion Amount (as defined below) into fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 3(b), at the Conversion Price (as defined below). The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Conversion Amount pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall be equal to the quotient of dividing the Conversion Amount by the Conversion Price. The Company shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock upon any conversion. If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any and all transfer agent fees, legal fees, costs and any other fees or costs that may be incurred or charged in connection with the issuance of shares of the Company s Common Stock to the Holder arising out of or relating to the conversion of this Note up to a maximum of five thousand dollars ($5,000); this amount does not include legal fees incurred by Holder.  

25

(a)     " Conversion Amount " means the portion of the Original Principal Amount and Interest to be converted, plus any penalties, redeemed or otherwise with respect to which this determination is being made.  
     
  (b)     " Conversion Price " shall equal $0.45; subject to adjustment herein.      

b.      Mechanics of Conversion .  
     
  (a)      Optional Conversion . To convert any Conversion Amount into shares of Common Stock on any date (a " Conversion Date "), the Holder shall (A) transmit by email, facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., New York, NY Time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit A  (the " Conversion Notice ") to the Company. On or before the third Business Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the " Share Delivery Date "), the Company shall (A) if legends are not required to be placed on certificates of Common Stock pursuant to the then existing provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 ( Rule 144 ) and provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depository Trust Company's (" DTC ") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system or (B) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled which certificates shall not bear any restrictive legends unless required pursuant the Rule 144. If this Note is physically surrendered for conversion and the outstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of this Note and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Note representing the outstanding Principal not converted. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock upon the transmission of a Conversion Notice.  
     
  (b)      Company's Failure to Timely Convert . If within three (3) Trading Days after the Company's receipt of the facsimile or email copy of a Conversion Notice together with documentation satisfactory to the Transfer Agent that the shares are eligible for such electronic issuance, the Company shall fail to issue and deliver to Holder via  DWAC/FAST  electronic transfer the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon such holder's conversion of any Conversion Amount (a " Conversion Failure "), the Outstanding Amount of the Note shall increase by $2,000 per day until the Company issues and delivers a certificate to the Holder or credit the Holder's balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon such holder's conversion of any Conversion Amount (under Holder s and Company s expectation that any damages will tack back to the Issuance Date).  Company will not be subject to any penalties once its transfer agent processes the shares to the DWAC system.  If the Company fails to deliver shares in accordance with the timeframe stated in this Section, resulting in a Conversion Failure, the Holder, at any time prior to selling all of those shares, may rescind any portion, in whole or in part, of that particular conversion attributable to the unsold shares and have the rescinded conversion amount returned to the Outstanding Balance with the rescinded conversion shares returned to the Company (under Holder s and Company s expectations that any returned conversion amounts will tack back to the original date of the Note).  

26

(c)      DWAC/FAST Eligibility.      If the Company fails for any reason (other than for compliance with applicable law) to deliver to the Holder the Shares by DWAC/FAST electronic transfer (such as by delivering a physical stock certificate) within fifteen (15) days, or if there is a Conversion Failure as defined in Section 3(b)(ii), and if the Holder incurs a Market Price Loss (defined below), then at any time subsequent to incurring the loss the Holder may provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Market Price Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole by paying the Market Price Loss in cash immediately:  
     
  Market Price Loss = [(High trade price for the period between the day of conversion and the day the shares clear in the Holder s brokerage account) x (Number of shares receivable from the conversion)]   [(Net Sales price realized by Holder) x (Number of shares receivable from the conversion)].  
     
  (d)      DTC Eligibility   Sub-Penny.  If the Company fails to maintain its status as DTC/DWAC Eligible according to common stipulations of the Depository Trust Company ( DTC/DWAC Eligible ) for any reason, or, if the Conversion Price is less than $0.01, the Principal Amount of the Note shall increase by ten thousand dollars ($10,000) (under Holder s and Company s expectation that any Principal Amount increase will tack back to the Issuance Date). In addition, the Conversion Price shall be redefined to equal 50% of the lowest trade occurring during the twenty-five (25) consecutive Trading Days immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date on which the Holder elects to convert all or part of this Note, subject to adjustment as provided in this Note.  
     
  (e)      Book-Entry . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of any portion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Company unless (A) the full Conversion Amount represented by this Note is being converted or (B) the Holder has provided the Company with prior written notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of this Note upon physical surrender of this Note. The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Principal and Interest converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon conversion.  
     
  c.      Limitations on Conversions or Trading .  
     
  (a)      Beneficial Ownership . If at any time after the Closing, the Buyer shall or would receive shares of Common Stock in payment of interest or principal under Note, upon conversion of the Note, under the Warrant, or upon exercise of the Warrant, so that the Buyer would, together with other shares of Common Stock held by it or its Affiliates, own or beneficially own by virtue of such action or receipt of additional shares of Common Stock a number of shares exceeding 4.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date (the   Maximum Percentage  ), the Company shall not be obligated and shall not issue to the Buyer shares of Common Stock which would exceed the Maximum Percentage, but only until such time as the Maximum Percentage would no longer be exceeded by any such receipt of shares of Common Stock by the Buyer. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, the Buyer may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Buyer and its Affiliates. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 5.13 to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 5.13 or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.  The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall apply to a successor holder of the Note and Warrant.  

27

d.      Other Provisions .  
     
  (a)      Share Reservation.       The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized Common Stock a number of shares equal to at least 3 (three) times the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding amounts under this Note and within 3 (three) Business Days following the receipt by the Company of a Holder's notice that such minimum number of Underlying Shares is not so reserved, the Company shall promptly reserve a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to comply with such requirement.  The Company will at all times reserve at least 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock for conversion.  
     
  (b)      Prepayment.      At any time following the Issuance Date, the Company shall have the option, upon 10 business days  notice to Holder, to pre-pay the entire remaining outstanding principal amount of this Note in cash.   
     
  (c)      Terms of Future Financings.  So long as this Note is outstanding, upon any issuance by the Company of any convertible promissory note at a conversion rate more favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that was not similarly provided to the Holder in this Note, then the Company shall notify the Holder of such additional or more favorable term. In such event, Holder may convert the current outstanding amount due under this Note into an investment on the same terms offered to the other investor. To the extent such investor simultaneously received a stock purchase warrant (for no additional consideration), Holder may also exchange the Warrant for a warrant on the terms issued to the investor. The types of terms contained in another security that may be more favorable to the holder of such security include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion discounts, conversion look-back periods, interest rates, original issue discounts, stock sale price, private placement price per share, and warrant coverage.   

28

(d)     All calculations under this Section 3 shall be rounded up to the nearest $0.00001 or whole share.  
     
  (e)     Nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue actual damages or declare an Event of Default pursuant to Section 2 herein for the Company's failure to deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon conversion within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief, in each case without the need to post a bond or provide other security. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law.   
     
  4.       Section 3(a)(10) Transaction   . So long as this Note is outstanding, the Company shall not enter into any transaction or arrangement structured in accordance with, based upon, or related or pursuant to, in whole or in part, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act (a  3(a)(10) Transaction ). In the event that the Company does enter into, or makes any issuance of Common Stock related to a 3(a)(10) Transaction while this note is outstanding, a liquidated damages charge of 25% of the outstanding principal balance of this Note, but not less than $25,000, will be assessed and will become immediately due and payable to the Holder at its election in the form of cash payment or addition to the balance of this Note.   
     
  5.      REISSUANCE OF THIS NOTE .  
     
  a.      Assignability.  The Company may not assign this Note. This Note will be binding upon the Company and its successors and will inure to the benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns and may be assigned by the Holder to anyone of its choosing without Company s approval.   
     
  b.      Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Note . Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Note, and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any indemnification undertaking by the Holder to the Company in customary form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation of this Note, the Company shall execute and deliver to the Holder a new Note representing the outstanding Principal.

Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, the Buyer may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 4.99% as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Buyer and its Affiliates. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 5.13 to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 5.13 or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.  The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall apply to a successor holder of the Note and Warrant.  
     
  3.      Mutilation or Loss of Warrant . Upon receipt by the Company of evidence satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) receipt of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and (in the case of mutilation) upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company will execute and deliver to the Holder a new Warrant of like tenor and date and any such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant shall thereupon become void.  
     
  4.      Rights of the Holder . The Holder shall not, by virtue of this Warrant alone, be entitled to any rights of a stockholder in the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of the Holder with respect to or arising under this Warrant are limited to those expressed in this Warrant and are not enforceable against the Company except to the extent set forth herein.  
     
  5.      Certain Adjustments .  
     
  5.1.      Capital Adjustments . If the Company shall at any time prior to the expiration of this Warrant subdivide the Common Stock, by split-up or stock split, or otherwise, or combine its Common Stock, or issue additional shares of its Common Stock as a dividend, the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall forthwith be automatically increased proportionately in the case of a subdivision, split or stock dividend, or proportionately decreased in the case of a combination. Appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the Exercise Price, Market Price (in the event of a cashless exercise), and other applicable amounts, but the aggregate purchase price payable for the total number of Warrant Shares purchasable under this Warrant (as adjusted) shall remain the same. Any adjustment under this Section 5.1 shall become effective automatically at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective, or as of the record date of such dividend, or in the event that no record date is fixed, upon the making of such dividend.  
     
  5.2.      Reclassification, Reorganization and Consolidation . In case of any reclassification, capital reorganization, or change in the capital stock of the Company (other than as a result of a subdivision, combination, or stock dividend provided for in Section 5.1 above), then the Company shall make appropriate provision so that the Holder shall have the right at any time prior to the expiration of this Warrant to purchase, at a total price equal to that payable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable in connection with such reclassification, reorganization, or change by a holder of the same number of shares of Common Stock as were purchasable by the Holder immediately prior to such reclassification, reorganization, or change. In any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interest of the Holder so that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable with respect to any shares of stock or other securities and property deliverable upon exercise hereof, and appropriate adjustments shall be made to the purchase price per Warrant Share payable hereunder, provided the aggregate purchase price shall remain the same.  

37

5.3.      Subsequent Equity Sales . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall sell or grant any option to purchase, or sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise dispose of or issue (or announce any offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase) any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, other than in an Exempt Transaction (defined below) entitling any person to acquire shares of Common Stock, at an effective price per share less than the then Exercise Price (such lower price, the   Base Share Price   and such issuances collectively, a   Dilutive Issuance  ) (if the holder of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share which is less than the Exercise Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Exercise Price on such date of the Dilutive Issuance), then the Exercise Price shall be reduced (and only reduced) to equal the Base Share Price and the number of Warrant Shares issuable hereunder shall be increased such that the Aggregate Exercise Price Payable hereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the Exercise Price, shall be equal to the Aggregate Exercise Price Payable prior to such adjustment. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued.   The Company shall notify the Holder in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance of any Common Stock subject to this Section 5.3, indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice the   Dilutive Issuance Notice  ).  For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 5.3, upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, after the date of such Dilutive Issuance the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares based upon the Base Share Price regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Share Price in the Notice of Exercise. An  Exempt Transaction  includes securities issued on the exact same terms as the Company s 2015 Unit Offering (Pricing Supplement No. 4 and subsequent), and options issued to persons providing services to the Company.  Initial  :_______   
     
  6.      Certificate as to Adjustments . In each case of any adjustment or readjustment in the shares of Common Stock issuable on the exercise of this Warrant, the Company at its expense will promptly cause its Chief Financial Officer or other appropriate designee to compute such adjustment or readjustment in accordance with the terms of this Warrant and prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based, including a statement of (a) the consideration received or receivable by the Company for any additional shares of Common Stock issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold, (b) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding or deemed to be outstanding, and (c) the Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock to be received upon exercise of this Warrant, in effect immediately prior to such adjustment or readjustment and as adjusted or readjusted as provided in this Warrant. The Company will forthwith mail a copy of each such certificate to the Holder and any Warrant Agent (as defined below) appointed pursuant to Section 8 hereof. Nothing in this Section 6 shall be deemed to limit any other provision contained herein.  
     
  7.      Transfer to Comply with the Securities Act . This Warrant, and the Warrant Shares, have not been registered under the 1933 Act. This Warrant, the Warrant Shares and any other security issued or issuable upon exercise of this Warrant may only be sold, transferred, pledged or hypothecated (other than to an Affiliate) if (a) there exists an effective registration statement under the 1933 Act relating to such security or (b) the Company has received an opinion of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company that registration is not required under the 1933 Act. Until such time as registration has occurred under the 1933 Act, each certificate for this Warrant, the Warrant Shares and any other security issued or issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall contain a legend, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel for the Company, setting forth the restrictions on transfer contained in this Section 7. Any such transfer shall be accompanied by a transferor assignment substantially in the form attached to this Warrant as  Exhibit B  (the   Transferor Assignment  ), executed by the transferor and the transferee and submitted to the Company. Upon receipt of the duly executed Transferor Assignment, the Company shall register the transferee thereon as the new Holder on the books and records of the Company and such transferee shall be deemed a  registered holder  or  registered assign  for all purposes hereunder, and shall have all the rights of the Holder.

The Company may, by written notice to the Holder, appoint an agent (a   Warrant Agent  ) for the purpose of issuing shares of Common Stock on the exercise of this Warrant pursuant hereto, exchanging this Warrant pursuant hereto, and replacing this Warrant pursuant hereto, or any of the foregoing, and thereafter any such issuance, exchange or replacement, as the case may be, shall be made at such office by such Warrant Agent.  
     
  9.      Transfer on the Company s Books . Until this Warrant is transferred on the books of the Company, the Company may treat the Holder as the absolute owner hereof for all purposes, notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  
     
  10.      Notices . Any notice required or permitted hereunder shall be given in the manner provided in the subsection titled  Notices  in the Purchase Agreement, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference.  
     
  11.      Supplements and Amendments; Whole Agreement.      This Warrant may be amended or supplemented only by an instrument in writing signed by the parties hereto. This Warrant, together with the Purchase Agreement and all the other Transaction Documents, taken together, contain the full understanding of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and there are no representations, warranties, agreements or understandings with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof other than as expressly contained herein and therein.  
     
  12.      Governing Law . This Warrant shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada, without giving effect to the principles thereof regarding the conflict of laws. The Company and, by accepting this Warrant, the Holder, each irrevocably (a) consent to and expressly submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in San Diego County, California in connection with any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Warrant, (b) agree that all claims in respect of any such dispute or proceeding may only be heard and determined in any such court, (c) expressly submit to the venue of any such court for the purposes hereof, and (d) waive any claim of improper venue and any claim or objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum or any other claim or objection to the bringing of any such proceeding in such jurisdictions or to any claim that such venue of the suit, action or proceeding is improper. The Company and, by accepting this Warrant, the Holder, each hereby irrevocably consent to the service of process of any of the aforementioned courts in any such proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof by reputable overnight courier (e.g., FedEx) or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such party s address as provided for herein, such service to become effective ten (10) calendar days after such mailing.  THE COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS WARRANT OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.   

39

13.      Remedies . The remedies at law of the Holder of this Warrant in the event of any default or threatened default by the Company in the performance of or compliance with any of the terms of this Warrant are not and will not be adequate and, without limiting any other remedies available to the Holder in the Transaction Documents, law or equity, to the fullest extent permitted by law, such terms may be specifically enforced by a decree for the specific performance of any agreement contained herein or by an injunction against a violation of any of the terms hereof or otherwise.  
     
  14.      Counterparts . This Warrant may be executed in any number of counterparts and each of such counterparts shall for all purposes be deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument. Signature delivered via facsimile or email shall be considered original signatures for purposes hereof.  
     
  15.      Descriptive Headings . Descriptive headings of the sections of this Warrant are inserted for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of the provisions hereof.  
     
  16.      Attorney s Fees . In the event of any litigation or dispute arising from this Warrant, the parties agree that the party who is awarded the most money shall be deemed the prevailing party for all purposes and shall therefore be entitled to an additional award of the full amount of the attorneys  fees and expenses paid by said prevailing party in connection with the litigation and/or dispute without reduction or apportionment based upon the individual claims or defenses giving rise to the fees and expenses.  Nothing herein shall restrict or impair a court s power to award fees and expenses for frivolous or bad faith pleading.  
     
  17.      Severability . Whenever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such provision shall be modified to achieve the objective of the parties to the fullest extent permitted and such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of this Warrant or the validity or enforceability of this Warrant in any other jurisdiction.

If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. The Company shall pay any and all transfer agent fees, legal fees, costs and any other fees or costs that may be incurred or charged in connection with the issuance of shares of the Company s Common Stock to the Holder arising out of or relating to the conversion of this Note up to a maximum of five thousand dollars ($5,000); this amount does not include legal fees incurred by Holder.

  (ii)     " Conversion Price " shall equal $0.45; subject to adjustment herein.   

3

(b)      Mechanics of Conversion .  
     
  (i)      Optional Conversion . To convert any Conversion Amount into shares of Common Stock on any date (a " Conversion Date "), the Holder shall (A) transmit by email, facsimile (or otherwise deliver), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., New York, NY Time, on such date, a copy of an executed notice of conversion in the form attached hereto as  Exhibit A  (the " Conversion Notice ") to the Company. On or before the third Business Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice (the " Share Delivery     Date "), the Company shall (A) if legends are not required to be placed on certificates of Common Stock pursuant to the then existing provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933 ( Rule 144 ) and provided that the Transfer Agent is participating in the Depository Trust Company's (" DTC ") Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, credit such aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled to the Holder's or its designee's balance account with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission system or (B) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in the DTC Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program, issue and deliver to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled which certificates shall not bear any restrictive legends unless required pursuant the Rule 144. If this Note is physically surrendered for conversion and the outstanding Principal of this Note is greater than the Principal portion of the Conversion Amount being converted, then the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, as soon as practicable and in no event later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of this Note and at its own expense, issue and deliver to the holder a new Note representing the outstanding Principal not converted. The Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock upon the transmission of a Conversion Notice.  
     
  (ii)      Company's Failure to Timely Convert . If within three (3) Trading Days after the Company's receipt of the facsimile or email copy of a Conversion Notice together with documentation satisfactory to the Transfer Agent that the shares are eligible for such electronic issuance, the Company shall fail to issue and deliver to Holder via  DWAC/FAST  electronic transfer the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon such holder's conversion of any Conversion Amount (a " Conversion Failure "), the Outstanding Amount of the Note shall increase by $2,000 per day until the Company issues and delivers a certificate to the Holder or credit the Holder's balance account with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder is entitled upon such holder's conversion of any Conversion Amount (under Holder s and Company s expectation that any damages will tack back to the Issuance Date).  Company will not be subject to any penalties once its transfer agent processes the shares to the DWAC system.  If the Company fails to deliver shares in accordance with the timeframe stated in this Section, resulting in a Conversion Failure, the Holder, at any time prior to selling all of those shares, may rescind any portion, in whole or in part, of that particular conversion attributable to the unsold shares and have the rescinded conversion amount returned to the Outstanding Balance with the rescinded conversion shares returned to the Company (under Holder s and Company s expectations that any returned conversion amounts will tack back to the original date of the Note).

Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, the Buyer may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Buyer and its Affiliates. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 5.13 to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 5.13 or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation.  The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall apply to a successor holder of the Note and Warrant.  

5

(d)      Other Provisions .  
     
  (i)      Share Reservation.       The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized Common Stock a number of shares equal to at least 3 (three) times the full number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of all outstanding amounts under this Note and within 3 (three) Business Days following the receipt by the Company of a Holder's notice that such minimum number of Underlying Shares is not so reserved, the Company shall promptly reserve a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to comply with such requirement.  The Company will at all times reserve at least 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock for conversion.  
     
  (ii)      Prepayment.      At any time following the Issuance Date, the Company shall have the option, upon 10 business days  notice to Holder, to pre-pay the entire remaining outstanding principal amount of this Note in cash.   
     
  (iii)      Terms of Future Financings.  So long as this Note is outstanding, upon any issuance by the Company of any convertible promissory note at a conversion rate more favorable to the holder of such security or with a term in favor of the holder of such security that was not similarly provided to the Holder in this Note, then the Company shall notify the Holder of such additional or more favorable term. In such event, Holder may convert the current outstanding amount due under this Note into an investment on the same terms offered to the other investor. To the extent such investor simultaneously received a stock purchase warrant (for no additional consideration), Holder may also exchange the Warrant for a warrant on the terms issued to the investor. The types of terms contained in another security that may be more favorable to the holder of such security include, but are not limited to, terms addressing conversion discounts, conversion look-back periods, interest rates, original issue discounts, stock sale price, private placement price per share, and warrant coverage.   
     
  (iv)     All calculations under this Section 3 shall be rounded up to the nearest $0.00001 or whole share.  

6

(v)     Nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue actual damages or declare an Event of Default pursuant to Section 2 herein for the Company's failure to deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon conversion within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief, in each case without the need to post a bond or provide other security. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law.   
     
  (4)       Section 3(a)(10) Transaction   . So long as this Note is outstanding, the Company shall not enter into any transaction or arrangement structured in accordance with, based upon, or related or pursuant to, in whole or in part, Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act (a  3(a)(10) Transaction ). In the event that the Company does enter into, or makes any issuance of Common Stock related to a 3(a)(10) Transaction while this note is outstanding, a liquidated damages charge of 25% of the outstanding principal balance of this Note, but not less than $25,000, will be assessed and will become immediately due and payable to the Holder at its election in the form of cash payment or addition to the balance of this Note.   
     
  (5)      REISSUANCE OF THIS NOTE .  
     
  (a)      Assignability.  The Company may not assign this Note.

This Warrant is being issued pursuant to the terms of that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated July 8, 2016, to which the Company and the Holder are parties (as the same may be amended from time to time, the   Purchase Agreement  ).    
     
  Unless otherwise indicated herein, capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Purchase Agreement.

  X =  Y (A-B)   
        A  
     
  Where    X =     the number of Warrant Shares to be issued to Holder.  
     
  Y =      the number of Warrant Shares that the Holder elects to purchase under this Warrant (at the date of such calculation).  
     
  A =     the Market Price (at the date of such calculation).  
     
  B =     Exercise Price (as adjusted to the date of such calculation).  
     
  For the purposes of this Warrant, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

    Common Stock Equivalents   shall mean any stock or securities (convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable) for shares of Common Stock, not including the Company s employee stock ownership plan.  
     
    Deemed Issuance   means a requested conversion under the Note that is not honored by the Company.   
     
    Exercise   Price   shall   mean sixty-five cents ($0.65) per share of Common Stock, subject to adjustments herein.  
     
    Market Price   shall mean the Closing Price for the Common Stock on the Trading Day that is (i) five Trading Days prior to the Exercise Date or (ii) the Issue Date, whichever is greater.

  (c)     If the Notice of Exercise form elects a  cash  exercise (or if the cashless exercise referred to in the immediately preceding subsection (b) is not available in accordance with the terms hereof), the Exercise Price per share of Common Stock for the Warrant Shares shall be payable, at the election of the Holder, in cash or by certified or official bank check or by wire transfer in accordance with instructions provided by the Company at the request of the Holder.  
     
  (d)     Upon the appropriate payment to the Company, if any, of the Exercise Price for the Warrant Shares, together with the surrender of this Warrant (if required), the Company shall promptly, but in no case later than the date that is three (3) Trading Days following the date the Exercise Price is paid to the Company (or with respect to a  cashless exercise,  the date that is three (3) Trading Days following the Exercise Date) (the   Delivery Date  ), provided that the Company remains DTC/DWAC Eligible (as defined in the Note) are then satisfied, deliver or cause the Company s Transfer Agent to deliver the applicable Warrant Shares electronically via the Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian (  DWAC  ) system to the account designated by the Holder on the Notice of Exercise.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Company has not met its obligation to deliver Warrant Shares by the Delivery Date unless the Transfer Agent has posted the shares for DWAC pickup and the Holder or its broker, as applicable, has been notified of this availability, or if the DWAC Eligible Conditions are not then satisfied, has actually received the certificate representing the applicable Warrant Shares no later than the close of business on the relevant Delivery Date pursuant to the terms set forth above.

The Company shall pay any late charges incurred under this subsection in immediately available funds upon demand;  provided, however , that, at the option of the Holder (without notice to the Company), such amount owed may be added to the principal amount of the Note. Furthermore, in addition to any other remedies which may be available to the Holder, in the event that the Company fails for any reason to effect delivery of the Warrant Shares as required under subsection (d) immediately above, the Holder may revoke all or part of the relevant Warrant exercise by delivery of a notice to such effect to the Company, whereupon the Company and the Holder shall each be restored to their respective positions immediately prior to the exercise of the relevant portion of this Warrant, except that the late charge described above shall be payable through the date notice of revocation or rescission is given to the Company.   
     
  (f)     The Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of the Warrant Shares issuable to it in accordance with the provisions of this Section 2.1 on the Exercise Date.

If at any time after the Closing, the Buyer shall or would receive shares of Common Stock in payment of interest or principal under Note, upon conversion of the Note, under the Warrant, or upon exercise of the Warrant, so that the Buyer would, together with other shares of Common Stock held by it or its Affiliates, own or beneficially own by virtue of such action or receipt of additional shares of Common Stock a number of shares exceeding 4.99% of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such date (the   Maximum Percentage  ), the Company shall not be obligated and shall not issue to the Buyer shares of Common Stock which would exceed the Maximum Percentage, but only until such time as the Maximum Percentage would no longer be exceeded by any such receipt of shares of Common Stock by the Buyer. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, the Buyer may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage to any other percentage not in excess of 4.99% as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to the Buyer and its Affiliates.

The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be waived and shall apply to a successor holder of the Note and Warrant.

Upon receipt by the Company of evidence satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant, and (in the case of loss, theft or destruction) receipt of reasonably satisfactory indemnification, and (in the case of mutilation) upon surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the Company will execute and deliver to the Holder a new Warrant of like tenor and date and any such lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated Warrant shall thereupon become void.  
     
  4.      Rights of the Holder . The Holder shall not, by virtue of this Warrant alone, be entitled to any rights of a stockholder in the Company, either at law or in equity, and the rights of the Holder with respect to or arising under this Warrant are limited to those expressed in this Warrant and are not enforceable against the Company except to the extent set forth herein.  
     
  5.      Certain Adjustments .  
     
  5.1.      Capital Adjustments . If the Company shall at any time prior to the expiration of this Warrant subdivide the Common Stock, by split-up or stock split, or otherwise, or combine its Common Stock, or issue additional shares of its Common Stock as a dividend, the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall forthwith be automatically increased proportionately in the case of a subdivision, split or stock dividend, or proportionately decreased in the case of a combination. Appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the Exercise Price, Market Price (in the event of a cashless exercise), and other applicable amounts, but the aggregate purchase price payable for the total number of Warrant Shares purchasable under this Warrant (as adjusted) shall remain the same. Any adjustment under this Section 5.1 shall become effective automatically at the close of business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective, or as of the record date of such dividend, or in the event that no record date is fixed, upon the making of such dividend.  
     
  5.2.      Reclassification, Reorganization and Consolidation . In case of any reclassification, capital reorganization, or change in the capital stock of the Company (other than as a result of a subdivision, combination, or stock dividend provided for in Section 5.1 above), then the Company shall make appropriate provision so that the Holder shall have the right at any time prior to the expiration of this Warrant to purchase, at a total price equal to that payable upon the exercise of this Warrant, the kind and amount of shares of stock and other securities and property receivable in connection with such reclassification, reorganization, or change by a holder of the same number of shares of Common Stock as were purchasable by the Holder immediately prior to such reclassification, reorganization, or change. In any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interest of the Holder so that the provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable with respect to any shares of stock or other securities and property deliverable upon exercise hereof, and appropriate adjustments shall be made to the purchase price per Warrant Share payable hereunder, provided the aggregate purchase price shall remain the same.

5.3.      Subsequent Equity Sales . If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall sell or grant any option to purchase, or sell or grant any right to reprice, or otherwise dispose of or issue (or announce any offer, sale, grant or any option to purchase) any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, other than in an Exempt Transaction (defined below) entitling any person to acquire shares of Common Stock, at an effective price per share less than the then Exercise Price (such lower price, the   Base Share Price   and such issuances collectively, a   Dilutive Issuance  ) (if the holder of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share which is less than the Exercise Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Exercise Price on such date of the Dilutive Issuance), then the Exercise Price shall be reduced (and only reduced) to equal the Base Share Price and the number of Warrant Shares issuable hereunder shall be increased such that the Aggregate Exercise Price Payable hereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the Exercise Price, shall be equal to the Aggregate Exercise Price Payable prior to such adjustment. Such adjustment shall be made whenever such Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents are issued.   The Company shall notify the Holder in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance of any Common Stock subject to this Section 5.3, indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice the   Dilutive Issuance Notice  ).  For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 5.3, upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, after the date of such Dilutive Issuance the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Warrant Shares based upon the Base Share Price regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Share Price in the Notice of Exercise. An  Exempt Transaction  includes securities issued on the exact same terms as the Company s 2015 Unit Offering (Pricing Supplement No. 4 and subsequent), and options issued to persons providing services to the Company.  Initial  :_______   
     
  6.      Certificate as to Adjustments .
