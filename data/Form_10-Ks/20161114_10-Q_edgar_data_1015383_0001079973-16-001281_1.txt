(Unaudited)

1.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Interim Financial Information:     The interim financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as promulgated in Item 210 of Regulation S-X.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("US GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial position as of September 30, 2016, results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been made.  The results for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year.  The accompanying financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K.

Basis of Presentation:     Retrospettiva, Inc. (the "Company") was organized under the laws of the State of California in November, 1990 to manufacture and import textile products, including both finished garments and fabrics.  The Company's manufacturing facilities and warehouses were located primarily in Europe.  The Company ceased operations in 2001 and was inactive from 2002 until commencement of the development stage.  On August 2, 2004, the Company was terminated, by administrative action of the State of California as a result of non-filing of required documents with the State of California.  Effective February 15, 2007, the Company reinstated its charter.

Effective October 11, 2006 (commencement of the development stage) efforts commenced to revive the Company.  Legal counsel was hired to address litigation involving the Company and activities were undertaken to prepare and file delinquent tax and financial reports.  Furthermore, a financial judgment against the Company dating back to 2002 was addressed and a final settlement was reached in October 2007.  The Company filed various delinquent reports to become current in its reporting obligations to the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and various taxing authorities.

The Company intends to evaluate structure and complete a merger with, or acquisition of, prospects consisting of private companies, partnerships or sole proprietorships.  The Company may seek to acquire a controlling interest in such entities in contemplation of later completing an acquisition.

Development Stage Company:     Based on the Company's business plan, it is a development stage company since planned principle operations have not yet commenced.  Accordingly, the Company presents its financial statements in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that apply to developing enterprises.  As a development stage enterprise, the Company discloses its retained earnings (or deficit accumulated) during the development stage and the cumulative statements of operations and cash flows from commencement of development stage to the current balance sheet date.  The development stage began on October 11, 2006, when management commenced its efforts to revive the Company.

6 

Per Share Amounts:      Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted earnings (loss) per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if potentially dilutive securities are converted into common shares.  Potentially dilutive securities, such as stock options and warrants, are excluded from the calculation when their inclusion would be anti-dilutive, such as periods when a net loss is reported or when the exercise price of the instrument exceeds the fair market value.  During 2016 and 2015, the Company has not issued any potentially dilutive securities.

Use of Estimates:     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain.  Estimates that are critical to the accompanying financial statements include the identification and valuation of assets and liabilities, valuation of deferred tax assets, and the likelihood of loss contingencies.  Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Estimates and assumptions are revised periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period it is determined to be necessary.  Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards.   The Company evaluates the pronouncements of various authoritative accounting organizations, primarily the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"), the SEC, and the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF"), to determine the impact of new pronouncements on US GAAP and the impact on the Company.

Accounting Standards Codification  - In September 2009, FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") as the single source of authoritative US GAAP to be applied by nongovernmental entities.  Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative US GAAP for SEC registrants.  The ASC is a new structure which took existing accounting pronouncements and organized them by accounting topic.  The ASC did not change current US GAAP, but was intended to simplify user access to all authoritative US GAAP by providing all the relevant literature related to a particular topic in one place.  All previously existing accounting standards were superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the ASC is considered non-authoritative.  New accounting standards issued subsequent to September 30, 2009, will be communicated by the FASB through Accounting Standards Updates (ASU's).  The ASC was effective during the period ended September 30, 2009.  Adoption of the ASC did not have an impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

The Company has recently adopted the following new accounting standards:

Subsequent Events  - In May 2009, the ASC guidance for subsequent events was updated to establish accounting and reporting standards for events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued.  The guidance was amended in February 2010.  The update sets forth: (i) the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements, (ii) the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet in its financial statements, and (iii) the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements.  The amended ASU was effective immediately and its adoption had no impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

7 

Fair Value Measurements    In January 2010, ASU 2010-6 amended existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurements by adding required disclosures about items transferring into and out of levels 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy; adding separate disclosures about purchase, sales, issuances, and settlements relative to level 3 measurements; and clarifying, among other things, the existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation. The ASU was adopted during the period ended September 30, 2010, and its adoption had no impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Consolidations    ASU 2009-17 revises the consolidation guidance for variable-interest entities. The modifications include the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable-interest entity, and changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable-interest entity. The ASU was adopted during the period ended September 30, 2010, and its adoption had no impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards Updates.      The following accounting standards updates were recently issued and have not yet been adopted by the Company.  These standards are currently under review to determine their impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

ASU No. 2010-11 was issued in March 2010, and clarifies that the transfer of credit risk that is only in the form of subordination of one financial instrument to another is an embedded derivative feature that should not be subject to potential bifurcation and separate accounting.  This ASU will be effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after September 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted.

ASU No. 2010-13 was issued in April 2010, and will clarify the classification of an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying security trades.  This ASU will be effective for the first fiscal quarter beginning after December 15, 2010, with early adoption permitted.

There were various other accounting standards updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or were applicable only to specific industries.  None of these additional recent updates are expected to have a material impact on the Company's financial position, operations, or cash flows.

2.     Going Concern

The Company's financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of obligations in the normal course of business.  However, the Company has no business operations and has negative working capital and has a total stockholders' deficit.  These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.

In view of these matters, continuation as a going concern is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn is dependent upon the Company's ability to meet its financial requirements, raise additional capital, and the success of its future operations.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments to the amount and classification of assets and liabilities that may be necessary should the Company not continue as a going concern.

Management has opted to file the Company's periodic financial reports with the SEC and then to raise funds through a private placement.  Management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern.

3.     Related Party Transactions

Effective July 2, 2007, the Company entered into a note payable agreement with a stockholder that provides for borrowings up to the principal amount of $64,871.  The note is uncollateralized and bears interest at an annual rate of 8%.  The original due date of September 30, 2008 has been modified, and the current terms of the note require it to be repaid upon demand.  The Company issued 945,987 shares of its common stock as additional consideration for the note payable.  As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the note payable was $64,871.

Effective November 14, 2007, the Company entered into a revolving convertible loan agreement with the President and a stockholder.  The agreement provides for borrowings up to the principal amount of $133,333.  The note is due on demand, is uncollateralized, bears interest at an annual rate of 8%, and is convertible into restricted common stock at $0.10 per share.  The Company issued 10,000,000 shares of its common stock as additional consideration for the note payable.  As of September 30, 2016, outstanding borrowings under the agreement totaled $133,395, including $-0- borrowed during 2016.

The Company accrued interest expense of $ 11,907 on the two notes payable during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

In addition to funds advanced under the borrowing arrangements described above, The Company's President previously advanced funds to the Company so that it could meet its financial obligations.  As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate amounts advanced, including amounts advanced and repayments during previous periods, were $6,934.  These advances are due on demand, uncollateralized and bear no interest.

The Company uses the offices of its President for its minimal office facility needs for no additional consideration.  No provision for these costs has been provided since it has been determined that they are immaterial.

4.     Income Taxes

Deferred income taxes arise from temporary timing differences in the recognition of income and expenses for financial reporting and tax purposes.  The Company's deferred tax assets consist entirely of the benefit from net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards.  The net operating loss carryforwards, if not used, will expire in various years through 2034, and are severely restricted as per the Internal Revenue code if there is a change in ownership.  The Company's deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance due to the uncertainty of the realization of the net operating loss carryforwards.  Net operating loss carryforwards may be further limited by other provisions of the tax laws.

The Company's deferred tax assets, valuation allowance, and change in valuation allowance are as follows:

Income taxes at the statutory rate are reconciled to the Company's reported income tax expense (benefit) as follows:

The Company also paid franchise taxes and related fees totaling $900 in 2012 for taxes for the State of California.  At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had accrued franchise taxes and related fees payable to the State of California totaling $ 3,775. and $2,975, respectively.

5.     Other Matters

On July 22, 2010, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with NewGen BioPharma Corporation ("NewGen").  NewGen is a start-up, early stage biopharmaceutical company that plans to develop and market therapeutic products that will generally be reformulations of existing active pharmaceutical ingredients.  Completion of the transaction contemplated by the Agreement was subject to a number of contractual closing conditions.  Those conditions were not satisfied and the Agreement was terminated.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis or Plan of Operation

Overview

The following discussion updates our plan of operation for the next twelve months. It also analyzes our financial condition at September 30, 2016 and compares it to our financial condition at September 30, 2015. Finally, the discussion summarizes the results of our operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and compares those results to the corresponding periods ended September 30, 2015.  This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, including footnotes, and the discussion and analysis included in our Form 10-K.

Plan of Operation

Retrospettiva, Inc. (the "Company") was organized under the laws of the State of California in November, 1990.  Prior to 2002, our business was to manufacture and import textile products, including both finished garments and fabrics.  Our manufacturing facilities and inventories were primarily located in Europe.  On July 2, 2001, we announced that the civil war in Macedonia rendered it impossible to continue operations.  We ceased operating and liquidated all of our assets.

On August 2, 2004, the Company was terminated, by administrative action of the State of California as a result of non-filing of required documents with the State of California.  Effective February 15, 2007, the Company reinstated its charter.

We have updated our affairs and become current in our various reporting obligations.  We intend to combine the Company with another entity in a merger, acquisition, or similar transaction and are seeking potential candidates.  Our plan is to evaluate prospects, structure a transaction, and ultimately combine with another entity.

On July 22, 2010, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with NewGen BioPharma Corporation ("NewGen").  NewGen is a start-up, early stage biopharmaceutical company that plans to develop and market therapeutic products that will generally be reformulations of existing active pharmaceutical ingredients.  Completion of the transaction contemplated by the Agreement was subject to a number of contractual closing conditions.  Those conditions were not satisfied and the Agreement was terminated.

We are unable, at this time, to predict when, if ever, our objectives will be achieved.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficit of $(331,343).  We had no current assets of $ -0- and current liabilities of $ 331,343.  This represents a $ 12,528 increase in the deficit from the working capital deficit of $(318,815) at December 31, 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our working capital deficit increased because of costs incurred to revive our business and to meet the ongoing reporting requirements for a public company.  These costs were funded by an increase in Additional paid in capital this quarter.

We will need additional funding to achieve our ultimate goals.  We do not believe we are a candidate for conventional debt financing and in the past we have relied on loans and advances from stockholders to fund our operations; however we have no guarantee that our stockholders will be willing and able to fund all of our future financing needs.

11 

We entered into a note payable agreement with one of our stockholders effective July 2, 2007.  The note provides for borrowings up to the principal amount of $64,871, is uncollateralized, and bears interest at an annual rate of 8%.  The original due date of September 30, 2008 has been modified, and the current terms of the note require it to be repaid upon demand.  We issued 945,987 shares of our common stock as additional consideration for the loan agreement.

On November 14, 2007, we entered into a loan agreement with our President and a stockholder.  The principal maximum amount that can be borrowed is $133,333.  The note is due on demand, is uncollateralized, bears interest at 8% per annum, and is convertible into restricted common stock at $0.10 per share.  We issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock as additional consideration for the note payable.  As of September 30, 2016, we had borrowed $133,395 under this arrangement and the amount available for future borrowings was $-62.

Our President previously advanced funds to us to meet our working capital needs.  As of September 30, 2016, we owe our President $6,934 for advances which are uncollateralized, non-interest bearing and due on demand.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred other obligations and liabilities which are reflected in the accompanying balance sheet as accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Net cash used in operating activities was $(3,993) during the nine months of 2016 compared to cash used of (1,520) during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  For both periods, all of our cash needs were funding changes in the balance sheet items such as accounts payable and accrued interest and expenses.

Results of Operations   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 ,  we recorded a net loss of $(5,234), or $nil per share, compared to a loss for the corresponding period of  201 5   of $(5,140) or $nil per share.  In neither period did we report any revenue.

We are considered a development stage company for accounting purposes, since we are working to revive the Company and to implement our plan of operations.  We are unable to predict with any degree of accuracy when this classification will change.  We expect to incur losses until such time, if ever, we begin generating revenue from operations.

Operating expenses increased to $1,236 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $942 for 2015, a difference of $294.  Accounting and auditing fees increased by $351 during 2016 while investor relations expenses decreased by ($57). Generally, the costs we incur are for meeting current reporting requirements for a public company.  During the recent three months of 2016, we incurred interest expense of $3,998 related to the notes payable to stockholders, compared to $3,998 incurred in 2015 or no change. This is because the Principle amount has not changes since November 2013.

Results of Operations   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of $(16,521), or $nil per share, compared to a loss for the corresponding period of 2015 of $(15,199) or $nil per share.  In neither period did we report any revenue.

Operating expenses increased to $ 4,214 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2,736 for 2015, a difference of $(1,478).  Accounting and auditing fees increased by $501 during 2016 while investor relations expenses increased by $977. Generally, the costs we incur are for meeting current reporting requirements for a public company.  During the most recent nine months of 2016, we incurred interest expense of $11,907 related to the notes payable to stockholders, compared to $11,863 incurred in 2015 or a small change related to leap year. This is because the Principle amount has not changes since November 2013.

Forward-Looking Statements

This Form 10-Q contains or incorporates by reference "forward-looking statements," as that term is used in federal securities laws, about our financial condition, results of operations and business.  These statements include, among others:

12 

- statements concerning the benefits that we expect will result from our business activities and results of business development that we contemplate or have completed, such as increased revenues; and

We caution you not to put undue reliance on these statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.  Further, the information contained in this document or incorporated herein by reference is a statement of our present intention and is based on present facts and assumptions, and may change at any time and without notice, based on changes in such facts or assumptions.

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

The important factors that could prevent us from achieving our stated goals and objectives include, but are not limited to, those set forth in our annual report on Form 10-K, other reports filed with the SEC and the following:

The worldwide economic situation;

Any change in interest rates or inflation;

The willingness and ability of third parties to honor their contractual commitments;

Our ability to raise additional capital, as it may be affected by current conditions in the stock market and competition for risk capital;

Environmental and other regulations, as the same presently exist and may hereafter be amended.

We undertake no responsibility or obligation to update publicly these forward-looking statements, but may do so in the future in written or oral statements.  Investors should take note of any future statements made by or on our behalf.

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures

(a)  We maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  As of September 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.

(b)              Changes in Internal Controls.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.
