  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements 

NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  General  
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all information or footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring items, necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements have been made. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures for the Company previously filed with the SEC in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  Operating results for the period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
  When we refer to the  Company,   we,   our,  or  us  in this Report, we mean IBERIABANK Corporation and subsidiaries (consolidated). When we refer to the  Parent,  we mean IBERIABANK Corporation. See the Glossary of Acronyms at the end of this Report for terms used throughout this Report. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The Company s consolidated financial statements include all entities in which the Company has a controlling financial interest under either the voting interest or variable interest model. The assessment of whether or not the Company has a controlling interest (i.e., the primary beneficiary) in a variable interest entity ("VIE") is performed on an on-going basis. All equity investments in non-consolidated VIEs are included in "other assets" in the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The Company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with non-consolidated VIEs was approximately   $130 million   and   $160 million   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company's maximum exposure to loss was equivalent to the carrying value of its investments and any related outstanding loans to the non-consolidated VIEs. 
  Investments in entities that are not consolidated are accounted for under either the equity, cost, or proportional amortization method of accounting. Investments for which the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financing decisions of the entity are accounted for under the equity method. Investments for which the Company does not hold such ability are accounted for under the cost method. Investments in qualified affordable housing projects, which meet certain criteria, are accounted for under the proportional amortization method.  
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries, IBERIABANK; Lenders Title Company; IBERIA Capital Partners, LLC; 1887 Leasing, LLC; IBERIA Asset Management, Inc.; 840 Denning, LLC; and IBERIA CDE, LLC. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
  Nature of Operations  
  The Company offers commercial and retail banking products and services to customers throughout locations in   seven   states through IBERIABANK. The Company also operates mortgage production offices in   10   states through IMC and offers a full line of title insurance and closing services throughout Arkansas and Louisiana through LTC and its subsidiaries. ICP provides equity research, institutional sales and trading, and corporate finance services throughout the energy industry. 1887 Leasing, LLC owns an aircraft used by management of the Company. IAM provides wealth management and trust services for commercial and private banking clients. CDE is engaged in the purchase of tax credits. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications did not have a material net impact on previously reported consolidated net income, shareholders  equity or cash flows. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are susceptible to significant change in the near term are the allowance for credit losses, valuation of and accounting for acquired loans, goodwill and other intangibles, income taxes, and fair value estimates. 

7 

Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  Most of the Company s business activity is with customers located within the states of Louisiana, Florida, Arkansas, Alabama, Texas, Tennessee and Georgia. The Company s lending activity is concentrated in its market areas in those states. The Company has emphasized originations of commercial loans and private banking loans, defined as loans to larger consumer clients. Concentrations in commercial real estate have increased as a result of the Company's recent acquisitions of CRE-focused banks.  Repayments on loans are expected to come from cash flows of the borrower and/or guarantor. Losses on secured loans are limited by the value of the collateral upon default of the borrowers and guarantor support. The Company does not have any significant concentrations to any one industry or customer.  

NOTE 2   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  ASU No. 2016-02  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842).   The most significant amendment to existing GAAP is the recognition of lease assets (i.e., right of use assets) and liabilities on the balance sheet for leases that are classified as operating leases by lessees. The lessor model remains similar to the current accounting model in existing GAAP. Additional amendments include, but are not limited to, the elimination of leveraged leases; modification to the definition of a lease; amendments on sale and leaseback transactions  ;   and disclosure of additional quantitative and qualitative information. 
  ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach.  
  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements, including whether to adopt any practical expedients or policy elections from this ASU. The Company is not expecting to early adopt the ASU. 
  ASU No. 2016-08, No. 2016-10, and No. 2016-12 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , to improve implementation guidance on principal versus agency considerations within Topic 606.  
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , to improve implementation guidance on identifying performance obligations and licensing aspects of Topic 606.  
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  , to provide clarification on certain targeted aspects of Topic 606.  
  The amendments in ASU No. 2016-08, No. 2016-10, and No. 2016-12 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that annual reporting period. The amendments will be applied through the election of one of two retrospective methods. 
  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASUs on the Company s consolidated financial statements. The Company is not expecting to early adopt the ASUs. 
  ASU No. 2016-09 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   The amendments will require recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies associated with awards which vest or settle within income tax expense or benefit in the statement of comprehensive income, with the tax effects treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. The ASU further requires entities to recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. This will eliminate the current APIC pool concept. 
  The amendments will also allow an accounting policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur, permit an entity to withhold up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdictions while still qualifying for equity classification, and change the classification of certain cash flows associated with stock compensation. 
  
   8 

ASU 2016-09 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The transition method for implementing each amendment varies. 
  The Company expects to elect an accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur upon adoption. Based on the Company's current stock valuation, it does not anticipate a significant impact to the Company's consolidated financial statements at adoption. 
  ASU No. 2016-13 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments -     Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The amendments introduce an impairment model that is based on expected credit losses ( ECL ), rather than incurred losses, to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments (e.g., loans and held-to-maturity securities), including certain off-balance sheet financial instruments (e.g., loan commitments). The ECL should consider historical information, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments, over the contractual term. Financial instruments with similar risk characteristics may be grouped together when estimating the ECL. 
  The ASU also amends the current AFS security impairment model for debt securities. The new model will require an estimate of ECL when the fair value is below the amortized cost of the asset through the use of an allowance to record estimated credit losses (and subsequent recoveries). Non-credit related losses will continue to be recognized through OCI. 
  In addition, the amendments provide for a simplified accounting model for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since their origination. The initial estimate of expected credit losses would be recognized through an ALL with an offset (i.e., increase) to the cost basis of the related financial asset at acquisition.  
  ASU 2016-13 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods. The amendments will be applied through a modified-retrospective approach, resulting in a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which OTTI had been recognized before the effective date. Amounts previously recognized in AOCI as of the date of adoption that relate to improvements in cash flows expected to be collected should continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the asset. Recoveries of amounts previously written off relating to improvements in cash flows after the date of adoption should be recorded in earnings when received. 
  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  ASU No. 2016-15 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , in order to reduce current diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  
  ASU 2016-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. 
  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on the Company s consolidated statement of cash flows. 

NOTE 3  ACQUISITION ACTIVITY 
  During 2015, the Company expanded its presence in Florida and Georgia through acquisitions of Florida Bank Group, Inc. on February 28, 2015, Old Florida Bancshares, Inc. on March 31, 2015, and Georgia Commerce Bancshares, Inc. on May 31, 2015. Further information on these acquisitions can be found in Note 3, Acquisition Activity, in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method in accordance with ASC Topic 805,   Business Combinations  . Accordingly, for each transaction, the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. In conjunction with the adoption of ASU 2015-16, upon receipt of final fair value estimates during the measurement period, which must be within   one   year of the acquisition dates, the Company records any adjustments to the preliminary fair value estimates in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company finalized the purchase price allocations related to the Florida Bank Group and Old  
  
   9 

Florida acquisitions.  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation related to the Georgia Commerce acquisition.  The year-to-date impact of these adjustments was a   $2.3 million   increase to goodwill, with an offsetting decrease to net deferred tax assets.

NOTE 4   INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
  The amortized cost and fair values of investment securities, with gross unrealized gains and losses, consist of the following: 

Securities with carrying values of    $1.3 billion   and   $1.4 billion   were pledged to secure public deposits and other borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  
   14 

Information pertaining to securities with gross unrealized losses, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position, is as follows:       

The Company assessed the nature of the losses in its portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   to determine if there are losses that should be deemed other-than-temporary. In its analysis of these securities, management considered numerous factors to determine whether there were instances where the amortized cost basis of the debt securities would not be fully recoverable, including, but not limited to: 

The length of time and extent to which the estimated fair value of the securities was less than their amortized cost, 
                
    Whether adverse conditions were present in the operations, geographic area, or industry of the issuer, 
                
    The payment structure of the security, including scheduled interest and principal payments, the issuer s failure to make scheduled payments, if any, and the likelihood of failure to make scheduled payments in the future, 
                
    Changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, and 
                
    Subsequent recoveries or additional declines in fair value after the balance sheet date. 
     
   15 

Management believes it has considered these factors, as well as all relevant information available, when determining the expected future cash flows of the securities in question. In each instance, management has determined the cost basis of the securities would be fully recoverable. Management also has the intent to hold debt securities until their maturity or anticipated recovery if the security is classified as available for sale. In addition, management does not believe the Company will be required to sell debt securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis of the security. As a result of the Company s analysis, no declines in the estimated fair value of the Company s investment securities were deemed to be other-than-temporary at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   73   debt securities had unrealized losses of   0.55%   of the securities  amortized cost basis. At   December 31, 2015  ,   252   debt securities had unrealized losses of   1.10%   of the securities  amortized cost basis. The unrealized losses for each of the securities related to market interest rate changes and not credit concerns of the issuers. Additional information on securities that have been in a continuous loss position for over twelve months at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is presented in the following table. 

The Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae securities are rated AA+ by Standard   Poor's and Aaa by Moody s. 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities by maturity at   September 30, 2016   are shown in the following table. Securities are classified according to their contractual maturities without consideration of principal amortization, potential prepayments or call options. Accordingly, actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities. Weighted average yields are calculated on the basis of the yield to maturity based on the amortized cost of each security.

NOTE 5   LOANS  
  Loans consist of the following, segregated into legacy and acquired loans, for the periods indicated: 

Since 2009, the Company has acquired certain assets and liabilities of   six   failed banks. Substantially all of the loans and foreclosed real estate that were acquired through these transactions were covered by loss share agreements between the FDIC and IBERIABANK, which afforded IBERIABANK loss protection. Covered loans, which are included in acquired loans in the tables above, were   $202.2 million   and   $229.2 million   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, of which   $169.0 million   and   $191.7 million  , respectively, were residential mortgage and home equity loans. Refer to Note 7 for additional information regarding the Company s loss sharing agreements. 
    
  Net deferred loan origination fees were   $20.9 million   and   $18.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. In addition to loans issued in the normal course of business, the Company considers overdrafts on customer deposit accounts to be loans and reclassifies these overdrafts as loans in its consolidated balance sheets. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , overdrafts of   $3.8 million   and   $5.1 million  , respectively, have been reclassified to loans. 
    
  Loans with carrying values of   $4.3 billion   and $  3.9 billion   were pledged as collateral for borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  
   18 

Aging Analysis 
  The following tables provide an analysis of the aging of loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Due to the difference in accounting for acquired loans, the tables below further segregate the Company s loans between loans originated by the Company ( legacy loans ) and acquired loans.  

19 

(1)   
    Past due information presents acquired loans at the gross loan balance, prior to application of discounts. 
               (2)   
    Past due loan amounts exclude acquired impaired loans, even if contractually past due or if the Company does not expect to receive payment in full, as the Company is currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.  

20 

Loans Acquired 
  As discussed in Note 3, during   2015  , the Company acquired loans with fair values of $  0.3 billion   from Florida Bank Group,   $1.1 billion   from Old Florida and   $0.8 billion   from Georgia Commerce. Of the total   $2.2 billion   of loans acquired,   $2.1 billion   were determined to have no evidence of deteriorated credit quality and are accounted for under ASC Topics 310-10 and 310-20. The remaining   $57.8 million   were determined to exhibit deteriorated credit quality since origination under ASC 310-30. The tables below show the balances acquired during 2015 for these   two   subsections of the portfolio as of the acquisition date.

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
  Information about the Company s troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ) at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented in the following tables. Modifications of loans that are accounted for within a pool under ASC Topic 310-30, which include covered loans, as well as certain acquired loans are excluded as TDRs. Accordingly, such modifications do not result in the removal of those loans from the pool, even if the modification of those loans would otherwise be considered a TDR. As a result, all covered and certain acquired loans that would otherwise meet the criteria for classification as a TDR are excluded from the tables below. 
    
  TDRs totaling   $218.6 million   and $  48.6 million   occurred during the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, through modification of the original loan terms. The following table provides information on how the TDRs were modified during the nine months ended September 30: 

(1)    Other concessions may include covenant waivers, forgiveness of principal or interest associated with a customer bankruptcy, or a combination of any of the above concessions. 
    
  Of the   $218.6 million   of TDRs occurring during the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $94.3 million   are on accrual status and   $124.3 million   are on non-accrual status.  Of the   $48.6 million   of TDRs occurring during the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2015  ,   $21.8 million   were on accrual status and   $26.8 million   were on non-accrual status at September 30, 2015.   
    
  The following table presents the end of period balance for loans modified in a TDR during the nine-month periods ended September 30:

Information detailing TDRs which defaulted during the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , and were modified in the previous twelve months (i.e., the twelve months prior to the default) is presented in the following table. The Company has defined a default as any loan with a loan payment that is currently past due greater than   30 days  , or was past due greater than   30 days   at any point during the previous twelve months, or since the date of modification, whichever is shorter.

Portfolio Segment Risk Factors 
  Commercial real estate loans include loans to commercial customers for long-term financing of land and buildings or for land development or construction of a building. These loans are repaid through revenues from operations of the businesses, rents of properties and refinances. Commercial and industrial loans represent loans to commercial customers to finance general working capital needs, equipment purchases and other projects where repayment is derived from cash flows resulting from business operations. The Company originates commercial business loans on a secured and, to a lesser extent, unsecured basis. 
  Residential mortgage loans consist of loans to consumers to finance a primary residence. The vast majority of the residential mortgage loan portfolio is comprised of one-to-four family mortgage loans secured by properties located in the Company's market areas and originated under terms and documentation that permit sale in the secondary market. 
  Consumer loans are offered by the Company in order to provide a full range of retail financial services to its customers and include home equity, credit card and other direct consumer installment loans. The Company originates substantially all of its consumer loans in its primary market areas. Loans in the consumer segment are sensitive to unemployment and other key consumer economic measures. 
  Credit Quality 
  The Company utilizes an asset risk classification system in accordance with guidelines established by the Federal Reserve Board as part of its efforts to monitor commercial asset quality. "Special mention" loans are defined as loans where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower cause management to have some doubt as to the ability of these borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in future disclosures of these loans as non-performing. For assets with identified credit issues, the Company has two primary classifications for problem assets: "substandard" and "doubtful". 
  Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of the substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full satisfaction of the loan balance outstanding questionable, which makes probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions, and values higher. Loans classified as "Pass" do not meet the criteria set forth for special mention, substandard, or doubtful classification and are not considered criticized. Asset risk classifications are determined at origination or acquisition and reviewed on an ongoing basis. Risk classifications are changed if, in the opinion of management, the risk profile of the customer has changed since the last review of the loan relationship. 
  The Company s investment in loans by credit quality indicator is presented in the following tables. The tables below further segregate the Company s loans between loans that were originated by the Company (legacy loans) and acquired loans. Loan premiums/discounts in the tables below represent the adjustment of non-covered acquired loans to fair value at the acquisition date, as adjusted for income accretion and changes in cash flow estimates in subsequent periods. Asset risk classifications for commercial loans reflect the classification as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . Credit quality information in the tables below includes loans acquired at the gross loan balance, prior to the application of premiums/discounts, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Loan delinquency is the primary credit quality indicator that the Company utilizes to monitor consumer asset quality. 

27 

28 

Legacy Impaired Loans 
  Information on the Company s investment in legacy impaired loans, which include all TDRs and all other non-accrual loans, is presented in the following tables as of and for the periods indicated. Legacy non-accrual mortgage and consumer loans, and commercial loans below the Company's specific threshold, are included for purposes of this disclosure although such loans are generally not evaluated or measured individually for impairment for purposes of determining the allowance for loan losses.  

29 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company was not committed to lend a material amount of additional funds to any customer whose loan was classified as impaired or as a troubled debt restructuring. 

NOTE 7   LOSS SHARING AGREEMENTS AND FDIC LOSS SHARE RECEIVABLES 
  Loss Sharing Agreements 
  Since 2009,  the Company has acquired certain assets and liabilities of   six   failed banks. Substantially all of the loans and foreclosed real estate acquired through these transactions are subject to loss share agreements between the FDIC and IBERIABANK, which afford IBERIABANK loss protection. 
  During the reimbursable loss periods, the FDIC will cover   80%   of covered loan and foreclosed real estate losses up to certain thresholds for the   six   acquisitions, and   95%   of losses that exceed contractual thresholds for   three   acquisitions. The reimbursable loss periods, excluding single family residential assets, ended in 2014 for   three   acquisitions, ended during 2015 for   one   acquisition and ended during the third quarter of 2016 for   two   acquisitions.  The reimbursable loss period for single family residential assets will end in 2019 for   three   acquisitions, in 2020 for   one   acquisition, and in 2021 for   two   acquisitions. To the extent that loss share coverage ends prior to triggering events on covered assets that would enable the Company to collect these amounts from the FDIC, future impairments may be required. 
  In addition, all covered assets, excluding single family residential assets, have a   three   year recovery period, which begins upon expiration of the reimbursable loss period. During the recovery periods, the Company must reimburse the FDIC for its share of any recovered losses, net of certain expenses, consistent with the covered loss reimbursement rates in effect during the recovery periods. 
  
   30 

FDIC loss share receivables 
  The Company recorded indemnification assets in the form of FDIC loss share receivables as of the acquisition date of each of the   six   banks covered by loss share agreements. At acquisition, the indemnification assets represented the fair value of the expected cash flows to be received from the FDIC under the loss share agreements. Subsequent to acquisition, the FDIC loss share receivables are updated to reflect changes in actual and expected amounts collectible, adjusted for amortization. 
  The following is a summary of the year-to-date activity for the FDIC loss share receivables: 

FDIC loss share receivables collectibility assessment 
  The Company assesses the FDIC loss share receivables for collectibility on a quarterly basis. Based on the collectibility analysis completed as of September 30, 2016, the Company concluded that the   $24.4 million   FDIC loss share receivable is fully collectible as of September 30, 2016. 

NOTE 8   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
  Goodwill 
  Changes to the carrying amount of goodwill by reporting unit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the year ended   December 31, 2015   are provided in the following table. 

The goodwill adjustments during the first nine months of   2016   are the result of updates to preliminary fair value estimates related to the 2015 acquisitions of Florida Bank Group, Old Florida, and Georgia Commerce, during the respective measurement periods. See Note 3 for further information on these acquisitions. 
  The Company performed the required annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2015. The Company s annual impairment test did not indicate impairment in any of the Company s reporting units as of the testing date. Following the testing date, management evaluated the events and changes that could indicate that goodwill might be impaired and concluded that subsequent interim tests were not necessary. The Company is currently in the process of performing its annual impairment test as of October 1, 2016. 
  
   31 

Mortgage Servicing Rights 
  Mortgage servicing rights are recorded at the lower of cost or market value in  other assets  on the Company's consolidated balance sheets and amortized over the remaining servicing life of the loans, with consideration given to prepayment assumptions. Mortgage servicing rights had the following carrying values as of the periods indicated: 

Title Plant 
  The Company held title plant assets recorded in "other assets" on the Company's consolidated balance sheets totaling   $6.7 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . No events or changes in circumstances occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to suggest the carrying value of the title plant was not recoverable. 
  Intangible assets subject to amortization 
  Definite-lived intangible assets had the following carrying values included in  other assets  on the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of the periods indicated: 

NOTE 9  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND OTHER HEDGING ACTIVITIES 
  The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, exposures related to liquidity and credit risk, and to facilitate customer transactions. The primary types of derivatives used by the Company include interest rate swap agreements, foreign exchange contracts, interest rate lock commitments, forward sales commitments, and written and purchased options. All derivative instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as "other assets" or "other liabilities" at fair value, as required by ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  .  
  For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss related to the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings or when the hedge is terminated. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately. In applying hedge accounting for derivatives, the Company establishes and documents a method for assessing the effectiveness of the hedging derivative and a measurement approach for determining the ineffective aspect of the hedge upon the inception of the hedge. The Company has designated interest rate swaps in a cash flow hedge to convert forecasted variable interest payments to a fixed rate on its junior subordinated debt and has concluded that the forecasted transactions are probable of occurring. 
  For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments, changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recognized in earnings immediately. 
  
   32 

Information pertaining to outstanding derivative instruments is as follows: 

33 

The Company is party to collateral agreements with certain derivative counterparties. Such agreements require that the Company maintain collateral based on the fair values of individual derivative transactions. In the event of default by the Company, the counterparty would be entitled to the collateral. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company was required to post   $58.0 million   and   $20.1 million  , respectively, in cash, which is included in "interest-bearing deposits in banks", or securities as collateral for its derivative transactions, on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not anticipate additional assets will be required to be posted as collateral, nor does it believe additional assets would be required to settle its derivative instruments immediately if contingent features were triggered at   September 30, 2016  . The Company s master netting agreements represent written, legally enforceable bilateral agreements that (1) create a single legal obligation for all individual transactions covered by the master agreement and (2) in the event of default, provide the non-defaulting counterparty the right to accelerate, terminate, and close-out on a net basis all transactions under the agreement and to promptly liquidate or set-off collateral posted by the defaulting counterparty. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Company does not offset fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral against recognized fair value amounts of derivatives executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement.  
  The following table reconciles the gross amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets to the net amounts that would result in the event of offset.   

            (1)   
    Consists of cash collateral recorded at cost, which approximates fair value, and investment securities.

(1)   
    Consists of cash collateral recorded at cost, which approximates fair value, and investment securities. 
     During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company has not reclassified into earnings any gain or loss as a result of the discontinuance of cash flow hedges because it was probable the original forecasted transaction would not occur by the end of the originally specified term. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not expect to reclassify any amount from accumulated other comprehensive income into interest income over the next twelve months for derivatives that will be settled. 
  
   35 

At   September 30, 2016   and 2015, and for the   three and nine   months then ended, information pertaining to the effect of the hedging instruments on the consolidated financial statements is as follows:

NOTE 10  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, CAPITAL RATIOS AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS 
  The Company and IBERIABANK are subject to various regulatory capital frameworks administered by federal and state agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and IBERIABANK, as applicable, must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
  On January 1, 2015, the Company and IBERIABANK became subject to revised capital adequacy standards as implemented by new final rules approved by the U.S. banking regulatory agencies, including the FRB, to address relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. Certain provisions of the new rules will be phased in from that date to January 1, 2019.  
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company was subject to an additional 25% phase out of its trust preferred securities from Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital. As a result,   100%   of the Company's trust preferred securities are excluded from Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital at   September 30, 2016  . Additionally, the Company and IBERIABANK's Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital were impacted at   September 30, 2016   by an additional 20% phase out of certain intangible assets above the   December 31, 2015   phase out percentage.  
  Management believes that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company and IBERIABANK met all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized IBERIABANK as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action (the prompt corrective action requirements are not applicable to the Company) existing at the time of notification. To be categorized as well capitalized, an institution must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the following table. There are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed that categorization.  
  The Company s and IBERIABANK s actual capital amounts and ratios as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented in the following table.  

37 

Beginning January 1, 2016, minimum CET1, Tier 1 Risk-Based Capital, and Total Risk-Based Capital ratios are subject to a capital conservation buffer of   0.625%  . This capital conservation buffer will increase in subsequent years by   0.625%   annually until it is fully phased in on January 1, 2019 at   2.50%  . At   September 30, 2016  , the capital conservation buffers of the Company and IBERIABANK were   4.49%   and   3.44%  , respectively.   
    
  On May 9, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of   2,300,000   depositary shares (the  Depositary Shares ), each representing a   1/400th   ownership interest in a share of the Company s   6.60%   Fixed-to-Floating Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, par value   $1.00   per share, ( Series C Preferred Stock ), with a liquidation preference of   $10,000   per share of Series C Preferred Stock (equivalent to   $25   per depositary share), which represents   $57,500,000   in aggregate liquidation preference.  
  Dividends will accrue and be payable on the Series C preferred stock, subject to declaration by the Company s board of directors, from the date of issuance to, but excluding May 1, 2026, at a rate of   6.60%   per annum, payable quarterly, in arrears, and from and including May 1, 2026, dividends will accrue and be payable at a floating rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus a spread of   492   basis points, payable quarterly, in arrears.  The Company may redeem the Series C preferred stock at its option, subject to regulatory approval, as described in the Prospectus. 
  On May 4, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to   950,000   shares of IBERIABANK Corporation's outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases under this program will be made from time to time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing of these repurchases will depend on market conditions and other requirements. The Company anticipates the share repurchase program will extend over a   2  -year time frame, or earlier if the shares have been repurchased. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased   202,506   common shares at a weighted average price of   $57.61   per common share. The Company did not repurchase any common shares during the third quarter of 2016. 

NOTE 11   EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Share-based payment awards that entitle holders to receive non-forfeitable dividends before vesting are considered participating securities that are included in the calculation of earnings per share using the two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula under which earnings per share is calculated for common stock and participating securities according to dividends declared and participating rights in undistributed earnings. Under this method, all earnings, distributed and undistributed, are allocated to common shares and participating securities based on their respective rights to receive dividends. 
  
   38 

The following table presents the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the periods indicated. 

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , the calculations for basic shares outstanding exclude the weighted average shares owned by the Recognition and Retention Plan ( RRP ) of   434,468  , and   616,307  , respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, basic shares outstanding exclude   456,921   and   606,621   shares owned by the RRP, respectively. 
  The effects from the assumed exercises of   73,882   and   82,310   stock options were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively, because such amounts would have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per common share. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, the effects from the assumed exercise of   268,257   and   79,690   stock options, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because such amounts would have had an antidilutive effect on earnings per common share. 

NOTE 12   SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION 
  The Company has various types of share-based compensation plans that permit the granting of awards in the form of stock options, restricted stock, restricted share units, phantom stock and performance units. These plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which selects persons eligible to receive awards and determines the terms, conditions and other provisions of the awards. At   September 30, 2016  , awards of   2,468,506   shares could be made under approved incentive compensation plans. 

39 

Stock option awards 
  The Company issues stock options under various plans to directors, officers and other key employees. The option exercise price cannot be less than the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the date of the option grant and the maximum option term cannot exceed   ten   years. 
  The following table represents the activity related to stock options during the periods indicated: 

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards. The following weighted-average assumptions were used for option awards issued during the following periods: 

The assumptions above are based on multiple factors, including historical stock option exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behaviors, expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of the Company s stock price. 
  The following table represents the compensation expense that is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to stock options for the following periods: 

At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $2.5 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   2.4   years. 
    
  Restricted stock awards 
  The Company issues restricted stock under various plans for certain officers and directors. The restricted stock awards may not be sold or otherwise transferred until certain restrictions have lapsed. The holders of the restricted stock receive dividends and have the right to vote the shares. The compensation expense for these awards is determined based on the market price of the Company s common stock at the date of grant applied to the total number of shares granted and is recognized over the vesting period. As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , unrecognized share-based compensation associated with these awards totaled   $18.3 million   and   $22.2 million  , respectively. 
  
   40 

Restricted share units 
  During the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , the Company issued restricted share units to certain of its executive officers. Restricted share units vest after the end of a   three  -year performance period, based on satisfaction of the market and performance conditions set forth in the restricted share unit agreement. Recipients do not possess voting or investment power over the common stock underlying such units until vesting. The grant date fair value of these restricted share units is the same as the value of the corresponding number of shares of common stock, adjusted for assumptions surrounding the market-based conditions contained in the respective agreements. 
  The following table represents the compensation expense that was included in non-interest expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income related to restricted stock awards and restricted share units for the periods indicated: 

The following table represents unvested restricted stock award and restricted share unit activity for the following periods: 

Phantom stock awards 
  The Company issues phantom stock awards to certain key officers and employees. The awards are subject to a vesting period of   five   to   seven   years and are paid out in cash upon vesting. The amount paid per vesting period is calculated as the number of vested  share equivalents  multiplied by the closing market price of a share of the Company s common stock on the vesting date. Share equivalents are calculated on the date of grant as the total award s dollar value divided by the closing market price of a share of the Company s common stock on the grant date. Award recipients are also entitled to a  dividend equivalent  on each unvested share equivalent held by the award recipient. A dividend equivalent is a dollar amount equal to the cash dividends that the participant would have been entitled to receive if the participant s share equivalents were issued in shares of common stock. Dividend equivalents are reinvested as share equivalents that will vest and be paid out on the same date as the underlying share equivalents on which the dividend equivalents were paid. The number of share equivalents acquired with a dividend equivalent is determined by dividing the aggregate of dividend equivalents paid on the unvested share equivalents by the closing price of a share of the Company s common stock on the dividend payment date. 
  Performance units 
  During   2015  , the Company issued performance units to certain of its executive officers. Performance units are tied to the value of shares of the Company s common stock, are payable in cash, and vest in increments of one-third per year after attainment of one or more performance measures. The value of performance units is the same as the value of the corresponding number of shares of common stock. 
  The following table indicates compensation expense recorded for phantom stock and performance units based on the number of share equivalents vested at September 30 of the periods indicated and the current market price of the Company s stock at that time: 

41 

The following table represents phantom stock award and performance unit activity during the periods indicated: 

(1)   
    Number of share equivalents includes all reinvested dividend equivalents for the periods indicated. 
               (2)   
    Except for share equivalents at the beginning of each period, which are based on the value at that time, and vested share payments, which are based on the cash paid at the time of vesting, the value of share equivalents is calculated based on the market price of the Company s stock at the end of the respective periods. The market price of the Company s stock was   $67.12   and   $58.21   on   September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , respectively. 

NOTE 13   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  Recurring fair value measurements 
  The Company has segregated all financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to estimate the fair value at the measurement date in the tables below. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for a description of how fair value measurements are determined. 

42 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 there were   no   transfers between the Level 1 and Level 2 fair value categories. 
  Non-recurring fair value measurements 
  The Company has segregated all assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis into the most appropriate level within the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to determine the fair value at the measurement date in the tables below. 

The tables above exclude the initial measurement of assets and liabilities that were acquired as part of the acquisitions completed in 2015. These assets and liabilities were recorded at their fair value upon acquisition in accordance with U.S. GAAP and were not re-measured during the periods presented unless specifically required by U.S. GAAP. Acquisition date fair values represent either Level 2 fair value measurements (investment securities, property, equipment, and debt) or Level 3 fair value measurements (loans, OREO, deposits, and core deposit intangible assets). 
  In accordance with the provisions of ASC Topic 310, the Company records certain loans considered impaired at their estimated fair value. A loan is considered impaired if it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Fair value is measured at the estimated fair value of the collateral for collateral-dependent loans. Impaired loans with an unpaid principal balance of   $120.6 million   and   $40.2 million   were recorded at their fair value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These loans include reserves and charge-offs of   $35.2 million   and   $8.5 million   included in the Company's allowance for credit losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  The Company did not record any liabilities at fair value for which measurement of the fair value was made on a non-recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Fair value option 
  The Company has elected the fair value option for certain originated residential mortgage loans held for sale, which allows for a more effective offset of the changes in fair values of the loans and the derivative instruments used to hedge them without the burden of complying with the requirements for hedge accounting. During the third quarter, an immaterial amount of mortgage loans held for sale for which the fair value option was elected were transferred from loans held for sale to loans held for investment. 
  The following table summarizes the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate unpaid principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale measured at fair value: 

43 

Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale is recognized based on contractual rates and is reflected in interest income on loans held for sale in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net gains (losses) resulting from the change in fair value of these loans that were recorded in mortgage income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled (  $1.5 million  ) and   $2.4 million  , respectively, while net gains resulting from the change in fair value of these loans were   $7 thousand   and   $3.7 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The changes in fair value are mostly offset by economic hedging activities, with an immaterial portion of these changes attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk. 

44 

NOTE 14   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  The estimated fair value of a financial instrument is the current amount that would be exchanged between willing parties, other than in a forced liquidation. Fair value is best determined based upon quoted market prices. However, in many instances, there are no quoted market prices for the Company s various financial instruments. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. Accordingly, the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument. ASC Topic 825,   Financial Instruments  , excludes certain financial instruments and all non-financial instruments from its disclosure requirements. Consequently, the aggregate fair value amounts presented may not necessarily represent the underlying fair value of the Company. 
  The carrying amount and estimated fair values, as well as the level within the fair value hierarchy, of the Company s financial instruments are included in the tables below.  See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for a description of how fair value measurements are determined.   

  The fair value estimates presented herein are based upon pertinent information available to management as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  

45 

NOTE 15   BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
  Each of the Company s reportable operating segments serves the specific needs of the Company s customers based on the products and services it offers. The reportable segments are based upon those revenue-producing components for which separate financial information is produced internally and primarily reflect the manner in which resources are allocated and performance is assessed. Further, the reportable operating segments are also determined based on the quantitative thresholds prescribed within ASC Topic 280,   Segment Reporting  , and consideration of the usefulness of the information to the users of the consolidated financial statements.  
  The Company reports the results of its operations through   three   reportable segments: IBERIABANK, IMC, and LTC. The IBERIABANK segment represents the Company s commercial and retail banking functions, including its lending, investment, and deposit activities. IBERIABANK also includes the Company s wealth management, capital markets, and other corporate functions. The IMC segment represents the Company s origination, funding, and subsequent sale of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. The LTC segment represents the Company s title insurance and loan closing services.  
  Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific reportable segment are allocated to segments based on pre-determined methods that reflect utilization. Also, within IBERIABANK are certain reconciling items that translate reportable segment results into consolidated results. The following tables present certain information regarding our operations by reportable segment, including a reconciliation of segment results to reported consolidated results for the periods presented. Reconciling items between segment results and reported results include: 

Elimination of interest income and interest expense representing interest earned by IBERIABANK on interest-bearing checking accounts held by related companies, as well as the elimination of the related deposit balances at the IBERIABANK segment; 
                
    Elimination of investment in subsidiary balances on certain operating segments included in total and average segment assets; and 
                
    Elimination of intercompany due to and due from balances on certain operating segments that are included in total and average segment assets.

NOTE 16   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
  Off-balance sheet commitments 
  In the normal course of business, to meet the financing needs of its customers, the Company is a party to credit related financial instruments, with risk not reflected in the consolidated financial statements. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and commercial letters of credit. Such commitments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The credit policies used for these commitments are consistent with those used for on-balance sheet instruments. The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of non-performance by its customers under such commitments or letters of credit represents the contractual amount of the financial instruments as indicated in the table below. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of guarantees under commercial and standby letters of credit was   $1.7 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively. These  amounts represent the unamortized fees associated with the guarantees and is included in  other liabilities  on the Company's consolidated balance sheets. This fair value will decrease as the existing commercial and standby letters of credit approach their expiration dates. 
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Company had the following financial instruments outstanding and related reserves, whose contract amounts represent credit risk: 

Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to be drawn upon, the total commitment amounts generally represent future cash requirements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral, if any, is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer. 
  Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines, and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers. Many of these types of commitments do not contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. See Note 6 for additional discussion related to the Company s unfunded lending commitments. 
  
   48 

Commercial and standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper issuance, bond financing, and similar transactions. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. When necessary they are collateralized, generally in the form of marketable securities and cash equivalents. 
  Legal proceedings  
  The nature of the business of the Company s banking and other subsidiaries ordinarily results in a certain amount of claims, litigation, investigations, and legal and administrative cases and proceedings, which are considered incidental to the normal conduct of business. Some of these claims are against entities or assets of which the Company is a successor or acquired in business acquisitions and certain of these claims will be covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. The Company has asserted defenses to these litigations and, with respect to such legal proceedings, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating or settling cases according to management s judgment as to what is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. 
  In July of 2016, a subsidiary of IBERIABANK received a subpoena from the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) requesting information on certain previously originated loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration ("FHA") as well as other documents regarding the subsidiary's FHA-related policies and practices.  The Company is cooperating with HUD and is in the process of responding to the subpoena.  Given the current status of the matter, the Company is unable to determine if its submission of the information requested will result in an additional information request by HUD and/or further proceedings by HUD or other government agencies.  
  The Company assesses its liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. Where it is probable that the Company will incur a loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company records a liability in its consolidated financial statements. These legal reserves may be increased or decreased to reflect any relevant developments on a quarterly basis. Where a loss is not probable or the amount of loss is not estimable, the Company does not accrue legal reserves. While the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain, based on information currently available, advice of counsel, and available insurance coverage, the Company s management believes that it has established appropriate legal reserves. Any liabilities arising from pending legal proceedings are not currently expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, or any unasserted claims, if unfavorable, may be material to the Company s consolidated financial position, consolidated results of operations, or consolidated cash flows. 
  As of the date of this filing, the Company believes the amount of losses associated with legal proceedings that it is reasonably possible to incur above amounts already accrued is immaterial.  

NOTE 17 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company may execute transactions with various related parties. These transactions are consummated at terms equivalent to the prevailing market rates and terms at the time.  Examples of such transactions may include lending or deposit arrangements, transfers of financial assets, services for administrative support, and other miscellaneous items. 
  The Company has granted loans to executive officers and directors and their affiliates. These loans, including the related principal additions, principal payments, and unfunded commitments are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. None of the related party loans were classified as non-accrual, past due, troubled debt restructurings, or potential problem loans at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015, with the exception of the loan discussed below. 
  IBERIABANK and several other financial institutions have extended credit (the  Credit Facility ) under a multi-bank syndicated credit facility to a corporation ("the Borrower"). One of the Company s independent directors is the Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Borrower. IBERIABANK holds approximately   six   percent of the total commitments from   twelve   banks under the Credit Facility, which based on the current borrowing base, equates to   $21.6 million   in IBERIABANK commitments. At December 31, 2015, there was   no   outstanding balance to IBERIABANK under the Credit Facility. At September 30, 2016, there was approximately   $20.5 million   outstanding to IBERIABANK under the Credit Facility. Depending on the type of advance, IBERIABANK earns interest on its advances under the Credit Facility at the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) or at a rate equal to the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1/2 of 1%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its  prime rate , or (c)  
  
   49 

LIBOR plus   1.00%  . At September 30, 2016, the outstanding amount due IBERIABANK under the Credit Facility was on non-accrual status. 
  Deposits from related parties held by the Company were immaterial at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

50

  Summary of 2016 Third Quarter Results of Operations 
  Net income available to common shareholders for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $44.5 million, a $2.0 million, or 4.7%, increase compared to $42.5 million for the same period in 2015. The primary drivers of the net $2 million increase included an $8.3 million increase in net interest income, a $2.3 million increase in non-interest income, and a $6.8 million decrease in non-interest expense, offset by a $7.4 million increase in provision expense, a $4.5 million increase in income taxes, and a $3.6 million increase in preferred dividends. The resulting earnings per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2016 were $1.08 compared to $1.03 for the same quarter of 2015.  
  Net interest income was $163.4 million for the third quarter of 2016, an $8.3 million, or 5.4%, increase compared to the same quarter of 2015, primarily driven by an increase in average earning assets and a decrease in average interest-bearing deposits, which helped to offset a decline in yield on loans and investment securities and a three basis point increase in overall funding costs. The net interest spread remained flat at 3.36% for both periods, and the net interest margin on an annualized basis increased three basis points to 3.53%, from 3.50%, when comparing the periods. 
  Non-interest income was $59.8 million in the third quarter of 2016, an increase of $2.3 million, or 4.1%, over the third quarter of 2015.  The period-over-period increase included slight increases in mortgage income, treasury management income, and COLI income partially offset by a slight decrease in title revenue. 
  Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2016 decreased $6.8 million, or 4.7%, to $138.1 million compared to $145.0 million during the same quarter of 2015. The third quarter of 2015 included impairment charges related to branch closures, a higher provision for unfunded lending commitments, and greater occupancy and equipment costs, which contributed to the quarter-over-quarter decrease.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits in 2016. 
    
  The Company's GAAP efficiency ratio was 61.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an improvement over the 68.2% efficiency ratio for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Including the effects of tax benefits related to tax-exempt income, and excluding amortization of intangibles and non-core revenues and expenses, the core tangible efficiency ratio on a tax-equivalent non-GAAP basis was 60.1% for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 64.8% for the third quarter of 2015.  The reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measure is included in Table 18. 
  Provision for loan losses increased $7.4 million, or 146.6%, to $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2015.  The increase is primarily related to the downward migration of energy-related credits, and to a lesser extent, loan growth in the Company's legacy portfolio. Annualized net charge-offs were 27 basis points and seven basis points of average loans during the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Summary of 2016 Year-to-Date Results 
  Net income available to common shareholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $134.6 million, a 36.8% increase compared to $98.4 million for the same period in 2015. Earnings for the first nine months of 2015 were impacted by $24.2 million in pre-tax merger-related expenses resulting from the acquisitions of Florida Bank Group, Old Florida and Georgia Commerce during that period. In addition, organic balance sheet growth and successful cost containment efforts contributed to the increase in net income during the first nine months of 2016.  
  Earnings per diluted common share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $3.26, compared to $2.59 for the same period in 2015. Excluding non-core items, primarily merger-related expenses impacting 2015 results, core earnings per share on a diluted basis (Non-GAAP) were $3.27 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.07 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. See Table 18, Reconciliations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures.

Net interest income was $487.6 million for the first nine months of 2016, a $61.0 million, or 14.3%, increase compared to the same period of 2015. The net interest spread increased six basis points to 3.44%, from 3.38%, and the net interest margin on an annualized basis increased seven basis points to 3.59%, from 3.52%, when comparing the periods. 
  Non-interest income increased $12.7 million, or 7.6%, to $180.6 million during the first nine months of 2016, which included increases in mortgage income, sales of SBA loans, service charges on deposit accounts, client derivatives income and treasury management income.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in broker commissions income from lower ICP revenues and the realized gain on a sale-leaseback transaction that occurred in 2015. 
  Non-interest expense for the first nine months of 2016 was $415.1 million, $16.2 million, or 3.8%, lower than the comparable period of 2015. The primary reason for the decrease is the merger-related expenses incurred on the 2015 acquisitions, as well as a decrease in the provision for unfunded lending commitments and higher gains on sales of former bank properties.  These decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily a result of the Company s acquisition-related growth, and an increase in FDIC insurance premiums, a result of a higher assessment base.  
  Provision expense was $39.3 million, up $20.1 million, or 104.5%, during the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is primarily due to a 239.2% increase in classified legacy commercial assets as of those respective period ends, substantially all of which was energy-related. 
  The Company's effective tax rate is 33.7% year-to-date in 2016, compared to 31.6% for the same period of the prior year.  Compared to 2015, income tax expense has increased due to an increase in pre-tax income, operations in higher state tax rate jurisdictions resulting from the 2015 acquisitions, as well as expired tax credits. 
  Summary of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 
  The Company s total loan portfolio increased $597.1 million, or 4.2%, from year-end 2015 to $14.9 billion at September 30, 2016, which was driven by legacy loan growth of $1.2 billion, partially offset by a decrease of $625.8 million in acquired loans. By loan type, the increase was primarily driven by legacy commercial loan growth of $985.9 million. 
  From an asset quality perspective, total non-performing assets increased $171.4 million, or 187.6%, compared to December 31, 2015.  The regression in asset quality from year-end is a result of loans to customers in the energy industry, which has been impacted by depressed oil and gas prices. Excluding energy-related loans, non-performing assets increased $25.1 million, or 29.8%, from year-end. The Company's total allowance for loan losses increased $9.8 million, or 7.1%, from $138.4 million at December 31, 2015 to $148.2 million at September 30, 2016, and represented approximately 1.0% of total loans at both December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016. 
  Total deposits increased $343.8 million, or 2.1%, to $16.5 billion at September 30, 2016, from $16.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Over the same period, non-interest-bearing deposits increased $435.3 million, or 10.0%, and equated to 29.0% and 26.9% of total deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The increase in deposits from year-end is a result of organic growth across multiple markets, primarily in non-interest bearing deposits. 
    
  Capital ratios as of September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015 were impacted by the phase out of the Company's remaining 25% of trust preferred securities from Tier 1 risk-based capital into Tier 2 capital, and the issuance of preferred stock and repurchase of common shares in May and June 2016, respectively, in addition to normal operations of the Company.  Overall, the Company's Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio increased 20 basis points and the total risk-based capital ratio increased 35 basis points from year-end. The Company met all capital adequacy requirements and IBERIABANK continued to meet the minimum requirements to be considered well-capitalized under regulatory guidelines as of September 30, 2016. 
  Business Outlook 
  The Company's long-term financial goals are as follows: 
             
    Core Return on Average Tangible Common Equity of 13% to 17%; 
                
    Core Tangible Efficiency Ratio of less than 60%; 
                
    Legacy Asset Quality in the top 10% of our peers; 
                
    Double-digit percentage growth in core diluted EPS. 
     The Company continues to face a challenging economic environment; however, remains strategically focused on achieving the long-term financial goals listed above. Concerns over future global economic growth have led to increased demand for safe haven assets and a corresponding contraction in interest rates, which has had a negative impact on the Company's margins.  
  
   53 

However, the Company has organically grown its balance sheet in 2016, which should serve to withstand the headwinds of the current economic uncertainty and potential political instability resulting from the upcoming presidential election. In addition, the Company believes that its market diversification and targeted "risk-off" strategy should continue to limit the impact of sustained low oil and gas prices and the related uncertainty in the energy sector on the Company's consolidated financial results. 
  The Company has been most impacted by the severe downturn in the energy industry that began in 2014. Excess oil supply and weakening global demand have weighed heavily on oil prices, which reached a 12-year low at less than $27 per barrel in January of 2016. While prices have rebounded, concerns over continuing inventory builds, future global economic growth and associated global oil demand, the responsiveness of oil producers, and general economic and geopolitical uncertainty could contribute to future disruptions in oil prices.  The Company experienced a downward migration in energy-related credits as expected over 2016, with 53.2% of the energy-related loan portfolio criticized, and 42.3% classified, at September 30, 2016, compared to 21.6% criticized and 11.6% classified at December 31, 2015. Energy-related non-performing assets were $153.6 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $7.3 million at December 31, 2015.  Energy-related reserves were $29.2 million, or 4.9% of energy-related outstandings as of September 30, 2016, compared to $26.7 million, or 3.9% of energy-related outstandings, at December 31, 2015. The Company remains cautious regarding the effects on its markets most impacted by the oil and gas industry; however, based on the data currently available, and the fact that energy-related loans comprise only 4.0% of total outstanding loans as of September 30, 2016, the Company does not expect a material impact to its future consolidated financial results or condition.  
  The mortgage origination locked pipeline was $282 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $227 million at December 31, 2015 and $283 million at September 30, 2015. Mortgage originations increased 2% year-to-date in 2016 compared to 2015 and volumes sold were up 2% year-over-year.    
  The Company has experienced revenue growth in certain of its fee income businesses during the first nine months of 2016.  Treasury management income has increased $3.2 million, or 31%, year-to-date in 2016 and client derivatives income is up approximately $4.4 million, or 144.7%, year-to-date.  IFS and IWA revenues are stable and essentially flat year-over-year. ICP, the Company's energy investment banking boutique, has faced headwinds, with revenues decreasing 30% year-over-year.  
  Cost control measures contributed to a GAAP efficiency ratio of 61.9% during the current quarter, and the efficiency ratio has decreased steadily over the past year from 68.2% in the third quarter of 2015. The Company's core tangible efficiency ratio on a tax-equivalent basis (Non-GAAP) was 60.1% in the third quarter of 2016. The Company's long-term goal is to sustain an efficiency ratio at or below 60% on a non-GAAP core basis. 
  The Company expects the following results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016: 
              
    Continued downward pressure on net interest margin, assuming no increase in interest rates, as a result of building balance sheet liquidity, the full impact of the recent increase in non-accrual loans, bond portfolio cash flow reinvestment at lower yields than the current portfolio rate, and the repricing of the loan portfolio at lower rates; 
                
    Full year loan loss provision of approximately $50 million;  
                
    Core non-interest expense of approximately $548 million for the full year;  
                
    Reduced income tax expense of approximately $6 million upon filing the 2015 tax return in the fourth quarter of 2016, resulting in an estimated after-tax non-core EPS benefit of approximately 15 cents per common share in the fourth quarter of 2016; and 
      Please see the "Non-GAAP Measures" section and Table 18 for a discussion on the reasons why the Company's management believes that presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding the Company's financial condition and results of operations.

ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following table sets forth selected financial ratios and other relevant data used by management to analyze the Company s performance. 
  TABLE 1   SELECTED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION    

(1)   
    With the exception of end-of-period ratios, all ratios are based on average daily balances during the respective periods. 
               (2)   
    Tangible calculations eliminate the effect of goodwill and acquisition-related intangible assets and the corresponding amortization expense on a tax-effected basis where applicable. See Table 18 for Non-GAAP reconciliations. 
               (3)   
    Interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on earning assets and the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average net earning assets. 
               (4)   
    Fully taxable equivalent (TE) calculations include the tax benefit associated with related income sources that are tax-exempt using a rate of 35%, which approximates the marginal tax rate. 
               (5)   
    The efficiency ratio represents non-interest expense as a percentage of total revenues. Total revenues are the sum of net interest income and non-interest income. 
               (6)   
    Non-performing loans consist of non-accruing loans and loans 90 days or more past due. Non-performing assets consist of non-performing loans and repossessed assets. 
               (7)   
    Acquired non-performing loans exclude acquired impaired loans, even if contractually past due or if the Company does not expect to receive payment in full, as the Company is currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. 
       
  Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin 
    
  Net interest income is the difference between interest realized on earning assets and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities and is also the driver of core earnings. As such, it is subject to constant scrutiny by management. The rate of return and relative risk associated with earning assets are weighed to determine the appropriate mix of earning assets. Additionally, the need for lower cost funding sources is weighed against relationships with clients and future growth opportunities.  
  The following tables set forth the quarter-to-date and year-to-date information regarding (i) the total dollar amount of interest income from earning assets and the resultant average yields; (ii) the total dollar amount of interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant average rates; (iii) net interest income; (iv) net interest spread; and (v) net interest margin.  
  
   55 

Information is based on average daily balances during the indicated periods. Investment security market value adjustments and trade-date accounting adjustments are not considered to be earning assets and, as such, the net effect of these adjustments is included in non-earning assets.

Net interest income was $163.4 million for the third quarter of 2016, an $8.3 million, or 5.4%, increase compared to the same quarter of 2015. The third quarter of 2016 reflects an $809.7 million, or 4.6%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a $177.5 million, or 1.4%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities compared to the third quarter of 2015. The earning asset yield increased three basis points to 3.89% during the third quarter of 2016. The increased interest income from earning asset volume in the third quarter of 2016 was partially offset by $1.5 million of interest reversals on loans moving to non-accrual status and $0.7 million accelerated bond premium amortization on the investment portfolio from higher prepayment speeds. While the FOMC increased rates in December of 2015, the incremental benefit of that rate increase was partially offset by compressing spreads on loan originations. Funding costs increased three basis points to 0.53% compared to the third quarter of 2015. Overall, the net interest spread remained flat at 3.36% for both three-month periods, and the net interest margin on an annualized basis increased three basis points to 3.53%, from 3.50%, when comparing the periods. 
  Net interest income was $487.6 million for the first nine months of 2016, a $61.0 million, or 14.3%, increase compared to the same period of 2015. Year-to-date 2016 results reflect a $1.9 billion, or 11.5%, increase in average earning assets, partially offset by a $912.4 million, or 7.7%, increase in average interest-bearing liabilities compared to the first nine months of 2015. The earning asset yield increased eight basis points to 3.95% during the first nine months of 2016, primarily due to the timing of investment securities purchases at higher yields and sale of lower yielding securities, offset by accelerated bond premium amortization.  In addition, amortization on FDIC loss share receivables, which result in a negative yield for this asset, has decreased 34.3% year-over-year. Funding costs increased two basis points to 0.51% when compared to 2015.  As a result, the net interest spread increased six basis points to 3.44%, from 3.38%, and the net interest margin on an annualized basis increased seven basis points to 3.59%, from 3.52%, when comparing the periods. 
  Average loans made up 79.9% and 79.1% of average earning assets in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 80.2% and 79.5% for the respective nine-month periods. Average loans increased $792.6 million, or 5.7%, when comparing the third quarter of 2016 to the same quarter of 2015, and $1.6 billion, or 12.4%, when comparing the nine months of 2016 to the same period of 2015. The increase in loans was a result of organic growth in the Company's legacy loan portfolio. Investment securities made up 15.3% and 15.2% of average earning assets for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 15.7% and 15.3% for the respective nine-month periods. 
  Average interest-bearing deposits made up 89.0% and 95.2% of average interest-bearing liabilities in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 90.4% and 92.4% for the respective nine-month periods. Average short-term borrowings and long-term debt comprised 11.0% of average interest-bearing liabilities in the third quarter of 2016, compared to 4.8% for the third quarter of 2015, and 9.6% for the first nine months of 2016, compared to 7.6% for the same period of 2015. 
  The following table sets forth information regarding average loan balances and average yields, segregated into the legacy and acquired portfolios, for the periods indicated.  
  TABLE 4   AVERAGE LOAN BALANCE AND YIELDS 

Provision for Loan Losses 
  Provision for loan losses increased $7.4 million, or 146.6%, to $12.5 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2015.  The increase is primarily attributable to the downward migration of energy-related credits as expected, due to general energy sector weakness, and to a lesser extent, growth in legacy loans. 
    
  Provision expense was $39.3 million, up $20.1 million, or 104.5%, during the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015. The increase is partially related to total loan growth of 5.7% from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016, but primarily is due to a significant increase in classified assets, predominantly energy-related legacy commercial loans, as of those respective  
  
   58 

period ends. Classified legacy commercial assets as of September 30, 2016 were $373.1 million, of which $253.6 million were energy-related, compared to classified legacy commercial assets of $110.0 million as of September 30, 2015, of which $41.6 million were energy-related. 
  See the "Asset Quality" section for further discussion on past due loans, non-performing assets, troubled debt restructurings and the allowance for credit losses. 
  Non-interest Income 
  The Company s operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included non-interest income of $59.8 million compared to $57.5 million for the same period of 2015. The $2.3 million, or 4.1%, increase in non-interest income included a $1.2 million, or 5.7%, increase in mortgage income, a $1.1 million, or 96.1%, increase in client derivatives income, a $0.9 million, or 24.5%, increase in treasury management income, as well as a $1.4 million, or 140.7% increase in income from COLI assets (which is more than offset by an increase in salaries and benefits expense within non-interest expense).  These increases were partially offset by a $0.6 million, or 9.4%, decrease in title revenue and a $0.8 million, or 24.0%, decrease in IFS revenues. Also of note, the increase in mortgage income during the current quarter was tempered by a $1.1 million valuation adjustment on a small portfolio of loans moved from held for sale to held for investment. Non-interest income as a percentage of total gross revenue (defined as total interest and dividend income and non-interest income) in the third quarter of 2016 was 24.9% compared to 25.1% of total gross revenue in the third quarter of 2015. 
  Non-interest income increased $12.7 million, or 7.6%, to $180.6 million during the first nine months of 2016, which included increases of $4.4 million, or 144.7%, in client derivatives income, $3.2 million, or 31.1%, in treasury management income, and $3.8 million, or 6.0%, in mortgage income.  These increases, in addition to increased non-interest income related to service charges on deposit accounts and sales of SBA loans, were partially offset by a $2.1 million, or 15.8%, decrease in broker commissions income from lower ICP revenues, and a $2.4 million gain on the sale of fixed assets in 2015, primarily related to the realized gain on a sale-leaseback transaction. 
  Non-interest Expense 
  Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2016 decreased $6.8 million, or 4.7%, compared to the same quarter of 2015.  
  Net occupancy and equipment expense decreased $1.5 million, or 8.1%, compared to the third quarter of 2015 due to decreases in rent and depreciation expenses. Credit and other loan related expense decreased $3.3 million, or 63.2%, from the year-ago quarter as a result of a lower reserve for unfunded lending commitments (although this was more than offset by an increase in provision expense).  Other non-interest expense decreased $3.2 million, or 24.3%, primarily due to a $1.9 million impairment charge taken in the third quarter of 2015 related to branch closures.      Offsetting these     decreases     was an increase in salaries and employee benefits of $2.6 million. 
    
  Non-interest expense for the first nine months of 2016 was $415.1 million, $16.2 million, or 3.8%, lower than the comparable period of 2015. The primary reason for the decrease is the merger-related expenses incurred during the first nine months of 2015 resulting from the Company's three 2015 acquisitions.  Data processing expense and professional services expense decreased $9.8 million, or 35.2%, and $4.4 million, or 23.5%, respectively year-over-year, predominantly due to merger-related expenses. 
  On a year-to-date basis, credit and other loan related expense decreased $6.6 million, or 46.8%, period-over-period primarily as a result of a $4.9 million decrease in the reserve for unfunded lending commitments due to a risk shift from higher-risk energy-related commitments, which have decreased as these lines have funded (in which case the provision for loan losses was increased) or been curtailed, to lower-risk unfunded commitments. Other non-interest expense decreased $3.7 million primarily due to a $3.9 million decrease in net costs of OREO property relating to impairment charges on branch closures taken in 2015, compared to the gains recognized on sales of those former bank properties in 2016. These decreases were offset by an $11.7 million, or 4.9%, increase in salaries and employee benefits expense, primarily a result of the Company s acquisition-related growth.  
  Income Taxes 
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $24.5 million and $20.1 million, respectively, equating to an effective income tax rate of 33.8% and 32.1%, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $72.2 million and $45.5 million, respectively, which resulted in an effective income tax rate of 33.7% for the first nine months of 2016 and 31.6% for the same period of 2015. 
  The difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory federal and state tax rates relates to items that are non-taxable or non-deductible, primarily the effect of tax-exempt income, the non-deductibility of a portion of the amortization recorded on  
  
   59 

acquisition intangibles, and various tax credits. The effective tax rate was negatively impacted in 2016 by the increase in pre-tax income, expiration of new market tax credits, and the post-merger effect of the 2015 acquisitions, which contributed to an increase in the Company's state effective tax rate given the higher statutory tax rates in Florida and Georgia.  

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  Earning Assets 
  Interest income associated with earning assets is the Company s primary source of income. Earning assets are composed of interest-earning or dividend-earning assets, including loans, securities, short-term investments and loans held for sale. As a result of organic growth, earning assets increased $1.2 billion, or 6.7%, since December 31, 2015. 
  The following discussion highlights the Company s major categories of earning assets. 
  Loans 
  The Company had total loans of approximately $14.9 billion at September 30, 2016, an increase of $597.1 million, or 4.2%, from December 31, 2015.  Legacy loans increased $1.2 billion, or 10.9%, to $12.4 billion at September 30, 2016, while acquired loans decreased $625.8 million, or 19.9%, to $2.5 billion at September 30, 2016. The growth in the legacy portfolio included increases in commercial loans of $985.9 million, or 12.1%, consumer loans of $90.9 million, or 3.8%, and mortgage loans of $146.1 million, or 21.0%, over December 31, 2015 balances.  With no additional acquisitions in the first nine months of 2016, the acquired portfolio is decreasing as expected over time as pay-downs and pay-offs occur.  In addition, acquired loans are transferred to the legacy portfolio as they are refinanced, renewed, restructured, or otherwise underwritten to the Company's standards. 
  The major categories of loans outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are presented in the following tables, segregated into legacy and acquired loans. 
  TABLE 5   SUMMARY OF LOANS   

  Loan Portfolio Components 
  The Company s loan to deposit ratio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 90.3% and 88.6%, respectively. The percentage of fixed rate loans to total loans was 43.9% at September 30, 2016 and 47.9% at December 31, 2015. The discussion below highlights activity by major loan type. Overall, the composition of the Company s loan portfolio as of September 30, 2016 is consistent with the composition as of December 31, 2015. 
  Commercial Loans 
  Total commercial loans increased $545.0 million, or 5.3%, to $10.7 billion at September 30, 2016, from $10.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Legacy commercial loan growth during the first nine months of 2016 totaled $985.9 million, a 12.1%  
  
   60 

increase from year-end 2015. The Company continued to attract and retain commercial customers as commercial loans were 72.0% of the total loan portfolio at September 30, 2016, compared to 71.2% at December 31, 2015. Unfunded commitments on commercial loans, including approved loan commitments not yet funded, were $3.9 billion at September 30, 2016, an increase of $346.2 million, or 9.7%, when compared to year-end 2015. 
    
  Commercial real estate loans increased $607.7 million, or 10.0%, during the first nine months of 2016, driven by an increase in legacy commercial real estate loans of $915.4 million, or 20.3%, partially offset by a decrease in acquired commercial real estate loans of $307.7 million, or 19.6%.  At September 30, 2016, commercial real estate loans totaled $6.7 billion, or 44.8% of the total loan portfolio, compared to 42.4% at December 31, 2015.  
  As of September 30, 2016, commercial and industrial loans totaled $3.5 billion, or 23.2% of the total loan portfolio. This represents an $18.4 million, or 0.5%, increase from December 31, 2015. 
  The following table details the Company s commercial loans by state, as defined by market of origination. 
  TABLE 6   COMMERCIAL LOANS BY STATE

Energy-related Loans 
  The Company s loan portfolio includes energy-related loans totaling $599.6 million outstanding at September 30, 2016, or 4.0% of total loans, compared to $680.8 million, or 4.8% of total loans, at December 31, 2015, a decrease of $81.1 million, or 11.9%. At September 30, 2016, E P loans accounted for 50.2% of energy-related loans and 54.2% of energy-related commitments. Midstream companies accounted for 18.5% of energy-related loans and 19.8% of energy commitments, while service company loans totaled 31.3% of energy-related loans and 26.0% of energy commitments. 
  The Company has been impacted by the severe downturn in the energy industry that began in 2014. Excess oil and gas supply and weakening global demand caused a rapid and sustained decline in energy commodity prices.  While oil and gas prices have rebounded, the length of the downturn has left the financial condition of businesses and communities tied to the oil and gas industries unsettled. The Company experienced a downward migration in energy-related credits as expected over 2016, with 53.2% of the energy-related loan portfolio criticized, and 42.3% classified, at September 30, 2016, compared to 21.6% criticized and 11.6% classified at December 31, 2015. Energy-related non-performing assets were $153.6 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $7.3 million at December 31, 2015.  Energy-related reserves were $29.2 million, or 4.9% of energy-related outstandings, as of September 30, 2016, compared to $26.7 million, or 3.9% of energy-related outstandings, at December 31, 2015. The Company charged-off $14.7 million of energy-related loans year-to-date in 2016, and had no energy-related charge-offs in 2015.  
  Mortgage Loans 
  The Company continues to sell the majority of conforming mortgage loan originations in the secondary market rather than assume the interest rate risk associated with these longer term assets. Upon the sale, the Company retains servicing on a limited portion of these loans. Total residential mortgage loans increased $75.2 million, or 6.3%, compared to December 31, 2015, largely due to an increase in private banking clients, as well as transfers of other non-conforming loans from held for sale to held for investment.  
  Consumer Loans 
  The Company offers consumer loans in order to provide a full range of retail financial services to its customers. The Company originates substantially all of its consumer loans in its primary market areas. At September 30, 2016, $2.9 billion, or 19.5%, of the total loan portfolio was comprised of consumer loans, compared to $2.9 billion, or 20.5%, at the end of 2015. Total consumer loans decreased $23.1 million, or 0.8%, from December 31, 2015, primarily due to a $92.3 million decrease in indirect automobile loans, a product that is no longer offered, partially offset by an $85.0 million increase in home equity loans. The majority of the consumer loan portfolio is comprised of home equity loans, which were $2.2 billion of the total $2.9 billion of consumer loans at September 30, 2016. 
  In order to assess the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, the Company considers the current U.S. economic environment and that of its primary market areas. See Note 6, Allowance for Credit Losses, for credit quality factors by loan portfolio segment. 
  Additional information on the Company s consumer loan portfolio is presented in the following tables. For the purposes of Table 8, unscoreable consumer loans have been included in loans with credit scores below 660. Credit scores reflect the Company s most recent information available as of the dates indicated.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale 
  Loans held for sale were $210.9 million at September 30, 2016, $166.2 million at December 31, 2015, and $202.2 million at September 30, 2015. The balances at the respective period-ends are impacted by the volume and timing of origination and sales activity.     Mortgage loan originations totaled $1.92 billion during the first nine months of 2016 and sales totaled $1.86 billion. Similarly, the Company originated $1.88 billion and sold $1.83 billion during the first nine months of 2015. 
  Loans held for sale have primarily been fixed-rate single-family residential mortgage loans under contracts to be sold in the secondary market. In most cases, loans in this category are sold within thirty days of closing. Buyers generally have recourse to return a purchased loan to the Company under limited circumstances. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, for further discussion.  
  Asset Quality 
  The lending activities of the Company are governed by written underwriting standards established by management and approved by the Board Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Commercial risk personnel, in conjunction with senior lending personnel, underwrite the vast majority of commercial business and commercial real estate loans. The Company provides centralized underwriting of substantially all residential mortgage, construction and consumer loans. Established loan origination procedures require appropriate documentation, including financial data and credit reports. For loans secured by real property, the Company generally requires property appraisals, title insurance or a title opinion, hazard insurance, and flood insurance, where appropriate. 
  Loan payment performance is monitored and late charges are generally assessed on past due accounts. Delinquent and problem loans are administered by functional teams of specialized risk officers. Risk ratings on commercial exposures are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted as necessary based on the obligor s risk profile and debt capacity.  Loan Review is responsible for independently assessing and validating risk ratings assigned to commercial exposures through a periodic sampling process.     All other loans are also subject to loan reviews through a similar periodic sampling process. The Company exercises judgment in determining the risk classification of its commercial loans.  
  
   63 

The Company utilizes an asset risk classification system in accordance with guidelines established by the FRB as part of its efforts to monitor commercial asset quality. In connection with their examinations of insured institutions, both federal and state examiners also have the authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, reclassify them. There are three classifications for problem assets:  substandard,   doubtful  and  loss , all of which are considered adverse classifications. Substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the weaknesses are not corrected. Doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full questionable, and there is a high probability of loss based on currently existing facts, conditions and values. An asset classified as loss is considered not collectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the Company is not warranted. Commercial loans with adverse classifications are reviewed by the Board Risk Committee of the Board of Directors periodically.  
  Commercial loans are placed on non-accrual status when any of the following occur: 1) the loan is maintained on a cash basis because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower; 2) collection of the full contractual amount of principal or interest is not expected (even if the loan is currently paying as agreed);  3) when principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more, unless the loan is both well secured and in the process of collection; or 4) the borrower has filed or is likely to file bankruptcy. Factors considered in determining the collection of the full contractual amount of principal or interest include assessment of the borrower s cash flow, valuation of underlying collateral, and the ability and willingness of guarantors to provide credit support.  Certain commercial loans are also placed on non-accrual status when payment is not past due and full payment of principal and interest is expected, but we have doubt about the borrower s ability to comply with existing repayment terms. Consideration will be given to placing a loan on non-accrual due to the deterioration of the debtor s repayment ability, the repayment of the loan becoming totally dependent on the liquidation of collateral, an existing collateral deficiency, the loan being classified as "Doubtful" or "Loss", the client filing, and/or foreclosure being initiated. Regarding all classes within the C I and CRE portfolios, the determination of a borrower s ability to make the required principal and interest payments is based on an examination of the borrower s current financial statements, industry, management capabilities, and other qualitative measures. 
  When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest income ceases and accrued but unpaid interest attributable to the current year is reversed against interest income. Accrued interest receivable attributable to the prior year is recorded as a charge-off to the allowance for credit losses. 
  Real estate acquired by the Company through foreclosure or by deed-in-lieu of foreclosure is classified as OREO, and is recorded at the lesser of the related loan balance (the pro-rata carrying value for acquired loans) or estimated fair value less costs to sell. Closed bank branches are also classified as OREO and recorded at the lower of cost or market value. 
  Under GAAP, certain loan modifications or restructurings are designated as TDRs. In general, the modification or restructuring of a debt constitutes a TDR if the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider under current market conditions. 
  Non-performing Assets 
  The Company defines nonperforming assets as non-accrual loans, accruing loans more than 90 days past due, OREO and foreclosed property. Management continually monitors loans and transfers loans to non-accrual status when warranted. The Company accounts for covered loans, loans formerly covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC, other loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality, as well as all loans acquired with significant discounts that did not exhibit deteriorated credit quality at acquisition, in accordance with ASC Topic 310-30. Collectively, all loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 are referred to as "purchased impaired loans". Application of ASC Topic 310-30 results in significant accounting differences, compared to loans originated or acquired by the Company that are not accounted for under ASC 310-30. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further details.  
  
   64 

The following table sets forth the composition of the Company's non-performing assets, including accruing loans 90 days or more past due and TDRs for the periods indicated. 
  TABLE 9   NON-PERFORMING ASSETS AND TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS  

(1)   
    Non-performing loans and assets include accruing loans 90 days or more past due. 
                 (4)   
    Acquired non-performing loans exclude acquired impaired loans, even if contractually past due or if the Company does not expect to receive payment in full, as the Company is currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans. 
     Legacy non-performing assets totaled $243.6 million at September 30, 2016, an increase of $175.6 million, or 258.0%, compared to December 31, 2015. Including TDRs that are in compliance with their modified terms, total legacy non-performing assets and TDRs increased $250.1 million during the first nine months of 2016. 
  Non-performing legacy loans were 1.87% of total legacy loans at September 30, 2016, 141 basis points higher than at December 31, 2015.  The increase in legacy non-performing assets was due primarily to an increase of $146.5 million in energy-related non-accrual loans. The majority of the increase in energy-related non-accruals is comprised of seven relationships that were deemed criticized in prior periods. 
  Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets have increased since year-end primarily due to the challenges that our energy-related customers have faced as previously discussed. Legacy non-performing assets were 1.33% of total legacy assets at September 30, 2016, 91 basis points higher than at December 31, 2015. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of non-performing legacy loans was 52.09% at September 30, 2016 and 209.41% at December 31, 2015. The Company s allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total legacy loans increased one basis point from 0.96% at December 31, 2015 to 0.97% at September 30, 2016. 
  The Company had gross charge-offs on legacy loans of $28.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Offsetting these charge-offs were recoveries of $3.1 million. As a result, net charge-offs on legacy loans for the first nine  
  
   65 

months of 2016 were $25.4 million, or 0.29% annualized of average loans, as compared to net charge-offs of $7.5 million, or 0.10% annualized, for the first nine months of 2015. 
    
  At September 30, 2016, excluding acquired loans, the Company had $350.3 million of legacy commercial assets classified as substandard, $22.7 million of legacy commercial assets classified as doubtful, and no assets classified as loss. Accordingly, the aggregate of the Company s legacy commercial classified assets was 1.79% of total assets, 2.50% of total loans, and 3.01% of legacy loans. At December 31, 2015, legacy commercial classified assets totaled $144.1 million, or 0.74% of total assets, 1.01% of total loans, and 1.29% of legacy loans. As with non-classified assets, a reserve for credit losses has been recorded for substandard and doubtful loans at September 30, 2016 in accordance with the Company s allowance for credit losses policy. 
  In addition to the problem loans described above, there were $122.5 million of legacy commercial loans classified as special mention at September 30, 2016, which in management s opinion were subject to potential future rating downgrades. Special mention loans are defined as loans where known information about possible credit problems of the borrowers causes management to have some doubt as to the ability of these borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms, which may result in future disclosure of these loans as non-performing. Special mention loans at September 30, 2016 increased $17.7 million, or 16.9%, from December 31, 2015, primarily due to commercial and industrial loans. 
  As noted above, the asset quality of the Company s energy-related loan portfolio has been and may continue to be impacted by low commodity prices. At September 30, 2016, non-accrual energy-related loans totaled $153.6 million, compared to $7.3 million at year-end 2015. Thus far in 2016, the Company has experienced $14.7 million in energy-related charge-offs.  There were no energy-related charge-offs in 2015.  
  The overall balance of the acquired loan portfolio has diminished as loans have paid down, paid off or been transferred to the legacy portfolio.  Acquired non-performing loans increased $3.0 million, or 52.2%, from year-end, and were 0.35% of total acquired loans at September 30, 2016, compared to 0.18% at December 31, 2015. This increase is primarily due to an increase in non-accrual commercial real estate loans. 
  Past Due Loans 
  Past due status is based on the contractual terms of loans. Legacy past due loans (including non-accrual loans) were 2.20% of total loans at September 30, 2016 and 0.65% at December 31, 2015.  At September 30, 2016, total past due acquired loans were 0.46% of total loans, an increase of 12 basis points from December 31, 2015.  Additional information on past due loans is presented in the following table. 
  TABLE 10   PAST DUE LOAN SEGREGATION 

(1)   
    Past due loan amounts exclude acquired impaired loans, even if contractually past due or if the Company does not expect to receive payment in full, as the Company is currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.  

66 

(1)   
    Past due loan amounts exclude acquired impaired loans, even if contractually past due or if the Company does not expect to receive payment in full, as the Company is currently accreting interest income over the expected life of the loans.  
     Total legacy loans past due increased $201.6 million, or 281.3%, from December 31, 2015, which included increases in legacy non-accrual loans of $176.2 million and $21.0 million of loans 30-89 days past due. The increase in legacy non-accrual loans was due primarily to a $146.4 million increase in energy-related non-accrual loans. 
  Total acquired past due loans increased $1.9 million from December 31, 2015 to $12.7 million at September 30, 2016. The change was due to an increase in non-accrual loans of $3.0 million offset by a $1.1 million decrease in loans 30-89 days past due. 
  Allowance for Credit Losses 
  The allowance for credit losses represents management s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent at the balance sheet date. Determination of the allowance for credit losses involves a high degree of complexity and requires significant judgment. Several factors are taken into consideration in the determination of the overall allowance for credit losses. Based on facts and circumstances available, management of the Company believes that the allowance for credit losses was appropriate at September 30, 2016 to cover probable losses in the Company s loan portfolio. However, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary, and the results of operations could be adversely affected, if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used by management in determining the allowance for credit losses. See the  Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   and Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for more information. 
  The allowance for credit losses was $160.2 million at September 30, 2016, or 1.07% of total loans, $7.7 million higher than at December 31, 2015. The allowance for credit losses as a percentage of loans was 1.06% at December 31, 2015. 
  The allowance for credit losses on the legacy portfolio increased $12.9 million, or 12.0%, since December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in legacy non-accrual and classified loans during the first nine months of 2016. Legacy non-accrual and commercial classified loans increased $176.2 million and $229.0 million, respectively, when compared to year-end 2015, primarily due to general energy sector weakness, as previously discussed. 
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses covered non-performing legacy loans 0.5 times and 1.8 times, respectively. Including acquired loans, the allowance for loan losses covered 61.6% and 241.7% of total non-performing loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  At September 30, 2016, the Company had an allowance for credit losses of $39.3 million to reserve for probable losses currently in the acquired loan portfolio that have arisen after the losses estimated at the respective acquisition dates.  
  
   67 

The following table sets forth the activity in the Company s allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated. 
  TABLE 11   SUMMARY OF ACTIVITY IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 

FDIC Loss Share Receivables 
  As part of the FDIC-assisted acquisitions in 2009 and 2010, the Company recorded a receivable from the FDIC, which represented the fair value of the expected reimbursable losses covered by the loss share agreements as of the acquisition dates. The FDIC loss share receivables decreased $15.5 million, or 38.8%, from $39.9 million at December 31, 2015 to $24.4 million at September 30, 2016. The decrease was due to amortization of $12.5 million, submission of reimbursable losses to the FDIC of $1.8 million, and a $1.2 million reversal of the provision for loan losses due to changes in estimated cash flows. See Note 7 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for discussion of the reimbursable loss periods of the loss share agreements. 
  Investment Securities 
  Investment securities increased by $76.9 million, or 2.7%, since December 31, 2015 to $3.0 billion at September 30, 2016. Investment securities approximated 14.3% and 14.9% of total assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Average investment securities were 15.7% of average earning assets in the first nine months of 2016, up from 15.3% for the same period of 2015. 
  All of the Company s mortgage-backed securities were issued by government-sponsored enterprises at September 30, 2016. The Company does not hold any Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock, corporate equity, collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, or structured investment vehicles, nor does it hold any private label collateralized mortgage obligations, sub-prime, Alt-A, or second lien elements in its investment portfolio. At September 30, 2016, the Company s investment portfolio did not contain any securities that are directly backed by subprime or Alt-A mortgages. 
  Funds generated as a result of sales and prepayments are used to fund loan growth and purchase other securities. The Company continues to monitor market conditions and take advantage of market opportunities with appropriate risk and return elements. 
  The Company assesses the nature of the unrealized losses in its investment portfolio at least quarterly to determine if there are losses that are deemed other-than-temporary. Based on its analysis, the Company concluded no declines in the market value of the Company s investment securities were deemed to be other-than-temporary at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Note 4 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements provides further information on the Company s investment securities. 
  Short-term Investments 
  Short-term investments primarily result from excess funds invested overnight in interest-bearing deposit accounts at the FRB and the FHLB of Dallas. These balances fluctuate daily depending on the funding needs of the Company and earn interest at the current FHLB and FRB discount rates. The balance in interest-bearing deposits at other institutions increased $504.8 million, or  
  
   68 

187.9%, from December 31, 2015 to $773.5 million at September 30, 2016. The Company s cash activity is further discussed in the  Liquidity and Other Off-Balance Sheet Activities  section below. 

FUNDING SOURCES 
  Deposits obtained from clients in its primary market areas are the Company s principal source of funds for use in lending and other business purposes. The Company attracts local deposit balances by offering a wide variety of products, competitive interest rates, convenient branch office locations and service hours, and mobile and online banking. Increasing core deposits through the development of client relationships, and acquisitions as opportunities arise, is a continuing focus of the Company. Short-term and long-term borrowings have become an important funding source as the Company has grown. Other funding sources include junior subordinated debt and shareholders  equity. Refer to the  Liquidity and Other Off-Balance Sheet Activities  section below for further discussion of the Company s sources and uses of funding. The following discussion highlights the major changes in the mix of deposits and other funding sources during the first nine months of 2016. 
  Deposits 
  The Company s ability to attract and retain customer deposits is critical to the Company s continued success. Total deposits increased $343.8 million, or 2.1%, to $16.5 billion at September 30, 2016, from $16.2 billion at December 31, 2015. Over the same period, non-interest-bearing deposits increased $435.3 million, or 10.0%, and equated to 29.0% and 26.9% of total deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
    
  The following table sets forth the composition of the Company s deposits as of the dates indicated. 
    
  TABLE 12   DEPOSIT COMPOSITION BY PRODUCT 

Short-term Borrowings 
  The Company may obtain advances from the FHLB of Dallas based upon its ownership of FHLB stock and certain pledges of its real estate loans and investment securities, provided certain standards related to the Company s creditworthiness have been met. These advances are made pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. The level of short-term borrowings can fluctuate significantly on a daily basis depending on funding needs and the source of funds chosen to satisfy those needs. 
  The Company also enters into repurchase agreements to facilitate customer transactions that are accounted for as secured borrowings. These transactions typically involve the receipt of deposits from customers that the Company collateralizes with its investment portfolio and have an average rate of 13.2 basis points.  
  The following table details the average and ending balances of repurchase transactions as of and for the nine months ended September 30: 
  TABLE 13   REPURCHASE TRANSACTIONS 

Total short-term borrowings increased $386.7 million, or 118.4%, from December 31, 2015, to $713.3 million at September 30, 2016, a result of increases of $250.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding and $136.7 million in repurchase agreements. On a quarter-to-date average basis, short-term borrowings increased $470.2 million, or 179.3%, from the third quarter of 2015. The increase in the average outstanding balance was largely due to the increase of FHLB advances during 2016. 
  
   69 

Total short-term borrowings were 3.9% of total liabilities and 51.5% of total borrowings at September 30, 2016, compared to 1.9% and 49.0%, respectively, at December 31, 2015. On a quarter-to-date average basis, short-term borrowings were 4.1% of total liabilities and 51.8% of total borrowings in the third quarter of 2016, compared to 1.5% and 43.3%, respectively, during the same period of 2015. 
  The weighted average rate paid on short-term borrowings was 0.40% and 0.17% during the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Long-term Debt 
    
  Long-term debt increased $332.0 million from December 31, 2015 to $672.4 million at September 30, 2016, due to an increase in FHLB advances during the period. The total change in long-term debt also included a decrease in new market tax credit notes payable associated with the unwind of certain tax credit investments at the end of the third quarter. On a period-end basis, long-term debt was 3.7% and 2.0% of total liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  On average, long-term debt increased to $682.7 million in the third quarter of 2016, $339.7 million, or 99.0%, higher than the third quarter of 2015, as the Company took advantage of favorable rates on FHLB advances to fund loan growth and for other liquidity purposes throughout the year. Average long-term debt was 3.9% of total liabilities during the current quarter, compared to 2.0% during the third quarter of 2015.  
  Long-term debt at September 30, 2016 included $481.6 million in fixed-rate advances from the FHLB of Dallas that cannot be prepaid without incurring substantial penalties. The remaining debt consisted of $120.1 million of the Company s junior subordinated debt and $70.7 million in notes payable on investments in new market tax credit entities. Interest on the junior subordinated debt is payable quarterly and may be deferred at any time at the election of the Company for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods. During any deferral period, the Company is subject to certain restrictions, including being prohibited from declaring dividends to its common and preferred shareholders. The junior subordinated debt is redeemable by the Company, at its option, in whole or in part. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Federal regulations impose minimum regulatory capital requirements on all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC. The FRB imposes similar capital regulations on bank holding companies. Compliance with bank and bank holding company regulatory capital requirements, which include leverage and risk-based capital guidelines, are monitored by the Company on an ongoing basis. Under the risk-based capital method, a risk weight is assigned to balance sheet and off-balance sheet items based on regulatory guidelines. 
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company exceeded all required regulatory capital ratios, and the regulatory capital ratios of IBERIABANK were in excess of the levels established for  well-capitalized  institutions, as shown in the following table. 
  TABLE 14   REGULATORY CAPITAL RATIOS 

The Company's 2016 Tier 1 capital ratio was impacted by the phase out of the remaining 25% of its trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital into Tier 2 capital. Additionally, the Company and IBERIABANK's CET1 capital, Tier 1 risk-based capital and total risk-based capital were impacted by an additional 20% phase out of certain intangible assets above the December 31,  
  
   70 

2015 phase out percentage. See Note 10 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company's capital ratios and shareholders' equity. 
    
  On May 4, 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 950,000 shares of IBERIABANK Corporation's outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases under this program will be made from time to time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing of these repurchases will depend on market conditions and other requirements. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased 202,506 common shares at a weighted average price of $57.61 per common share. The Company did not repurchase common shares during the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  On May 9, 2016, the Company issued an aggregate of 2,300,000 depositary shares (the  Depositary Shares ), each representing a 1/400th ownership interest in a share of the Company s 6.60% Fixed-to-Floating Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C, par value $1.00 per share, ( Series C Preferred Stock ), with a liquidation preference of $10,000 per share of Series C Preferred Stock (equivalent to $25 per depositary share), which represents $57,500,000 in aggregate liquidation preference. See Note 10 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Company's preferred share issuance. 

LIQUIDITY AND OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET ACTIVITIES 
  Liquidity refers to the Company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to support its operations and to meet its obligations, including the withdrawal of deposits by customers, commitments to originate loans, and its ability to repay its borrowings and other liabilities. Liquidity risk is the risk to earnings or capital resulting from the Company s inability to fulfill its obligations as they become due. Liquidity risk also develops from the Company s failure to timely recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the ability to liquidate assets in a timely manner or to obtain adequate funding to continue to operate on a profitable basis. 
  The primary sources of funds for the Company are deposits and borrowings. Other sources of funds include repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and, to a lesser extent, off-balance sheet borrowing availability. Certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year or less at September 30, 2016 totaled $1.8 billion. Based on past experience, management believes that a significant portion of maturing deposits will remain with the Company. Additionally, the majority of the investment securities portfolio is classified as available-for-sale, which provides the Company the ability to liquidate unencumbered securities as needed. Of the $3.0 billion in the investment securities portfolio, $1.7 billion is unencumbered and the remaining $1.3 billion has been pledged to support repurchase transactions, public funds deposits and certain long-term borrowings. Due to the relatively short implied duration of the investment securities portfolio, the Company has historically experienced significant cash inflows on a regular basis  .   Securities cash flows may be dependent on prepayment speeds and could change as economic or market conditions change. 
  Scheduled cash flows from the amortization and maturities of loans and securities are relatively predictable sources of funds. Conversely, deposit flows, prepayments of loan and investment securities, and draws on customer letters and lines of credit are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, competition, and customer demand. The FHLB of Dallas provides an additional source of liquidity to make funds available for general requirements and also to assist with the variability of less predictable funding sources. At September 30, 2016 the Company had $841.6 million of outstanding FHLB advances, of which $360.0 million was short-term and $481.6 million was long-term. Additional FHLB borrowing capacity at September 30, 2016 amounted to $4.4 billion. At September 30, 2016, the Company also has various funding arrangements with commercial banks providing up to $175.0 million in the form of federal funds and other lines of credit. At September 30, 2016, there were no balances outstanding on these lines, and all of the funding was available to the Company. 
  Liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management. The Company manages its liquidity with the objective of maintaining sufficient funds to respond to the predicted needs of depositors and borrowers and to take advantage of investments in earning assets and other earnings enhancement opportunities. Excess liquidity is generally invested in short-term investments such as overnight deposits. On a longer-term basis, the Company maintains a strategy of investing in various lending and investment security products. The Company uses its sources of funds primarily to fund loan commitments and meet its ongoing commitments associated with its operations. Based on its available cash at September 30, 2016 and current deposit modeling, the Company believes it has adequate liquidity to fund ongoing operations. The Company has adequate availability of funds from deposits, borrowings, repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities to provide the Company additional working capital if needed.

ASSET/LIABILITY MANAGEMENT, MARKET RISK AND COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK 
  The principal objective of the Company s asset and liability management function is to evaluate the Company's overall interest rate risk, determine the appropriate level of risk given the Company s business focus, operating environment, capital and liquidity requirements and performance objectives, establish prudent asset concentration guidelines, and manage the risk consistent with Board approved guidelines. Through such management, the Company seeks to reduce the vulnerability of its operations to changes in interest rates. The Company s actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the Asset and Liability Committee. The Asset and Liability Committee normally meets monthly to review, among other things, the sensitivity of the Company s assets and liabilities to interest rate changes, local and national market conditions, and interest rates. In connection therewith, the Asset and Liability Committee generally reviews the Company s liquidity, cash flow needs, composition of investments, deposits, borrowings, and capital position. 
  The objective of interest rate risk management is to control the effects that interest rate fluctuations have on net interest income and on the net present value of the Company s earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Management and the Board are responsible for managing interest rate risk and employing risk management policies that monitor and limit this exposure. Interest rate risk is measured using net interest income simulation and asset/liability net present value sensitivity analyses. The Company uses financial modeling to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the net interest margin and to predict market risk. Estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape, prepayments on loans and securities, deposit decay rates, pricing decisions on loans and deposits, reinvestment/replacement of asset and liability cash flows, and others. These analyses provide a range of potential impacts on net interest income and economic value of equity caused by interest rate movements. 
    
  Included in the modeling are instantaneous parallel rate shift scenarios, which are utilized to establish exposure limits. These scenarios are known as  rate shocks  because all rates are modeled to change instantaneously by the indicated shock amount, rather than a gradual rate shift over a period of time that has traditionally been more realistic. 
  The Company s interest rate risk model indicates that the Company is asset sensitive in terms of interest rate sensitivity. Based on the Company s interest rate risk model at September 30, 2016, the table below illustrates the impact of an immediate and sustained 100 and 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income.  
  TABLE 15   INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY 

The influence of using the forward curve as of September 30, 2016 as a basis for projecting the interest rate environment would approximate a 0.9% increase in net interest income over the next 12 months. The computations of interest rate risk shown above are performed on a static balance sheet and do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to unanticipated changes in interest rates and other factors to include shifts in deposit behavior. 
  The short-term interest rate environment is primarily a function of the monetary policy of the FRB. The principal tools of the FRB for implementing monetary policy are open market operations, or the purchases and sales of U.S. Treasury and federal agency securities, as well as the establishment of a short-term target rate. The FRB s objective for open market operations has varied over the years, but the focus has gradually shifted toward attaining a specified level of the federal funds rate to achieve the long-run goals of price stability, full employment, and sustainable economic growth. The federal funds rate is the basis for overnight funding and drives the short end of the yield curve. Longer maturities are influenced by the market s expectations for economic growth and inflation, but can also be influenced by FRB actions and expectations of monetary policy going forward.  
  The FOMC of the FRB, in an attempt to stimulate the overall economy, has, among other things, kept interest rates low through its targeted Federal funds rate. On December 17, 2015, the FOMC voted to raise the target Federal funds rate by 0.25%, the first increase since 2006. The FOMC expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the Federal funds rate over the next several years. As the FOMC increases the Federal funds rate, it is possible that overall interest rates could rise, which may negatively impact the housing markets and the U.S. economic recovery. In addition,  
  
   72 

deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our commercial borrowers, and the values of collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. 
  The Company s commercial loan portfolio is also impacted by fluctuations in the level of the LIBOR, as a large portion of this portfolio reprices based on this index. Our net interest income may be reduced if more interest-earning assets than interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature during a period when interest rates are declining, or more interest-bearing liabilities than interest-earning assets reprice or mature during a period when interest rates are rising. 
  The table below presents the Company s anticipated repricing of loans and investment securities over the next four quarters. 
  TABLE 16   REPRICING OF CERTAIN EARNING ASSETS    (1)   

(1)      Amounts include expected maturities, scheduled paydowns, expected prepayments, and loans subject to floors and exclude the repricing of assets from prior periods, as well as covered loans, non-accrual loans and market value adjustments. 
  As part of its asset/liability management strategy, the Company has emphasized the origination of loans with adjustable or variable rates of interest as well as commercial and consumer loans, which typically have shorter terms than residential mortgage loans. The majority of fixed-rate, long-term residential loans are sold in the secondary market to avoid assumption of the interest rate risk associated with longer duration assets in the current low rate environment. As of September 30, 2016, $8.4     billion, or 56.1%, of the Company s total loan portfolio had adjustable interest rates. The Company had no significant concentration to any single borrower or industry segment at September 30, 2016. 
  The Company s strategy with respect to liabilities in recent periods has been to emphasize transaction accounts, particularly non-interest or low interest-bearing transaction accounts, which may be less sensitive to changes in interest rates. At September 30, 2016, 86.8% of the Company s deposits were in transaction and limited-transaction accounts, compared to 86.9% at December 31, 2015. Non-interest-bearing transaction accounts were 29.0% and 26.9% of total deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  Much of the liquidity increase experienced in the past several years has been due to a significant increase in non-interest-bearing demand deposits. The behavior of non-interest-bearing deposits and other types of demand deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the Company's interest rate and liquidity risk positions. A loss of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of the Company s balance sheet as interest-bearing funds would most likely be increased to offset the loss of this favorable funding source. 
  The table below presents the Company s anticipated repricing of liabilities over the next four quarters. 
  TABLE 17   REPRICING OF LIABILITIES    (1)   

(1)      Amounts exclude the repricing of liabilities from prior periods. 
  As part of an overall interest rate risk management strategy, derivative instruments may also be used as an efficient way to modify the repricing or maturity characteristics of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities. Management may from time to time  
  
   73 

engage in interest rate swaps to effectively manage interest rate risk. The interest rate swaps of the Company would modify net interest sensitivity to levels deemed appropriate.  

IMPACT OF INFLATION OR DEFLATION AND CHANGING PRICES 
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with GAAP, which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation. Unlike most industrial companies, the majority of the Company s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on the Company s performance than does the effect of inflation. Although fluctuations in interest rates are neither completely predictable nor controllable, the Company regularly monitors its interest rate position and oversees its financial risk management by establishing policies and operating limits. Interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation to a larger extent than interest rates. Although not as critical to the banking industry as to other industries, inflationary factors may have some impact on the Company s growth, earnings, total assets and capital levels. Management does not expect inflation to be a significant factor in 2016. 
  Conversely, a period of deflation could affect our business, as well as all financial institutions and other industries. Deflation could lead to lower profits, higher unemployment, lower production and deterioration in overall economic conditions. In addition, deflation could depress economic activity, including loan demand and the ability of borrowers to repay loans, and consequently impair earnings through increasing the value of debt while decreasing the value of collateral for loans.  
  Management believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on financial results relates to the Company's ability to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to cushion against future losses. However, the Company would employ certain risk management tools to maintain its balance sheet strength in the event a deflationary scenario were to develop. 
   
  Non-GAAP Measures 
  This discussion and analysis included herein contains financial information determined by methods other than in accordance with GAAP. The Company s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in their analysis of the Company s performance.  Non-GAAP measures include but are not limited to descriptions such as core, tangible, and pre-tax pre-provision.  These measures typically adjust GAAP performance measures to exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles and include the tax benefit associated with revenue items that are tax-exempt, as well as adjust income available to common shareholders for certain significant activities or transactions that in management s opinion can distort period-to-period comparisons of the Company s performance. Transactions that are typically excluded from non-GAAP performance measures include realized and unrealized gains/losses on former bank owned real estate, realized gains/losses on securities, income tax gains/losses, merger related charges and recoveries, litigation charges and recoveries, and debt repayment penalties. Management believes presentations of these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information that is essential to a proper understanding of the operating results of the Company s core businesses. These non-GAAP disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for operating results determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.  Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP disclosures are presented in Table 18, with the exception of forward-looking information. The Company is unable to estimate GAAP EPS guidance without unreasonable efforts due to the nature of one-time or unusual items that cannot be predicted, and therefore has not provided this information under Regulation S-K Item 10(e)(1)(i)(B).

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk are presented at December 31, 2015 in Part II, Item 7A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2016. Additional information at September 30, 2016 is included herein under Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations . 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  An evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 was carried out under the supervision, and with the participation of, the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ). Based on that evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in alerting them in a timely manner to material information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ). 
  Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed by the Company under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls are also designed with the objective of ensuring that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Disclosure controls include review of internal controls that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that transactions are properly authorized, assets are safeguarded against unauthorized or improper use and transactions are properly recorded and reported. There was no significant change in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting. 
  Any control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that its objectives are achieved. The design of a control system inherently has limitations, including the controls  cost relative to their benefits. Additionally, controls can be circumvented. No cost-effective control system can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, will be detected.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  Information concerning Iberiabank Corporation's repurchases of its outstanding common stock during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, is included in the following table: 
    
  Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 

On May 4, 2016, IBERIABANK Corporation's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 950,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. Stock repurchases under this program will be made from time to time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing of these repurchases will depend on market conditions and other requirements. The Company anticipates the share repurchase program will extend over a two-year time frame, or earlier if the shares have been repurchased. The share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any dollar amount or number of shares, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. 
    
  Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchase of Stock 
    
  Holders of  IBERIABANK Corporation common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as the Company's Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Furthermore, holders of IBERIABANK Corporation common stock are subject to the prior dividend rights of any holders of the Company's preferred stock then outstanding. There were 13,750 shares of preferred stock outstanding at September 30, 2016. 
    
  IBERIABANK Corporation understands the importance of returning capital to shareholders. Management will continue to execute the capital planning process, including evaluation of the amount of the common stock dividend, with the Board of Directors and in conjunction with the regulators, subject to the Company's results of operations. Also, IBERIABANK Corporation is a bank holding company, and its ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends.
