  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
   
  NOTE 1   COMPANY DESCRIPTION 
  Nobilis Health Corp. ( Nobilis  or the  Company ) was incorporated on March 16, 2007 under the name "Northstar Healthcare Inc." pursuant to the provisions of the British Columbia   Business Corporations Act  . On December 5, 2014, Northstar Healthcare Inc. changed its name to Nobilis Health Corp. The Company owns and manages health care facilities in the States of Texas and Arizona, consisting primarily of ambulatory surgery centers and acute-care surgical hospitals. In 2014, through its acquisition of Athas Health, LLC ( Athas ), the Company expanded its service offering within the health care industry to include providing contracted marketing services and accounts receivable factoring. 
   
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements have not been audited by the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, except that the Consolidated Balance Sheet at   December 31, 2015  , is derived from previously audited consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for fair presentation have been included. These interim consolidated financial statements include all accounts of the Company. All significant intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated upon consolidation. 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to current period financial statement classifications. The reclassifications included in these comparative consolidated financial statements are (i) a change in presentation of other comprehensive income and (ii) a reclassification from cost of goods sold to operating expenses. The reclassifications were deemed to be immaterial to the consolidated financial statements both individually and in the aggregate. 
  These consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for complete financial statements. Therefore, these interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   ( 2015 Annual Report ) filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016. The operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year. 
  There have been no material changes to the Company s critical accounting policies or estimates from those disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall (Topic 825): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ). This update changes how entities account for and measure the fair value of certain equity investments and updates the presentation and disclosure of certain financial assets and liabilities. This new ASU is effective for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-01 will have on the Company s consolidated financial position and disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 ). The amendments address how an entity should assess whether it is the principal or the agent in contracts that include three or more parties. The ASU clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. The amendments affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09 which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this ASU are the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, which will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the method of adoption that it will use and the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ("ASU-2016-09"). ASU 2016-09 impacts several aspects of the accounting for share-based  
  
   6 

     Table of Contents  

payment transactions, including classification of certain items on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and accounting for income taxes. Specifically, the ASU requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (the difference between the deduction for tax purposes and the compensation cost recognized for financial reporting purposes) be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, introducing a new element of volatility to the provision for income taxes. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective on January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The transition method varies for each of the areas in the ASU. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting standard on its results of operations and financial position. 
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  , which clarifies the guidance in ASU 2014-09 regarding assessing whether promises to transfer goods or services are distinct, and whether an entity's promise to grant a license provides a customer with a right to use or right to access the entity's intellectual property. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this ASU are the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, which will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ). This Update provides for amendments to ASU 2014-09, amending the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. Specifically, ASU 2016-12 clarifies that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all (or substantially all) of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy GAAP. In addition, ASU 2016-12 clarifies how an entity should evaluate the collectability threshold and when an entity can recognize nonrefundable consideration received as revenue if an arrangement does not meet the standard s contract criteria. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this ASU are the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, which will be effective for the Company for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows   (Topic 230):   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 5   TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET 
  A detail of trade accounts receivable, net as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows (  in thousands  ): 

Bad debt expense was   zero   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and was   $0.9 million   and   $1.1 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   respectively. 
  From time to time, we transfer to third parties certain of our accounts receivable balances on a non-recourse basis in return for advancement on payment to achieve a faster cash collection. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there remained a balance of   $0.4 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, in transferred receivables pursuant to the terms of the original agreement. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company received advanced payments of   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively. During the same time period, the Company transferred   $0.8 million   and   $1.4 million   of receivables, net of advancement of payment. Concurrently, upon collection of these transferred receivables, payment will be made to the transferee. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company received advanced payments of   $0.6 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively. During the same time period, the Company transferred   $4.9 million   and   $5.2 million   of receivables, respectively. Concurrently, upon collection of these transferred receivables, payment will be made to the transferee. 
  Athas, Peak Neuromonitoring ( Peak ), and Nobilis Surgical Assist ( First Assist ) purchase receivables from physicians, at a discount, on a non-recourse basis. The discount and purchase price vary by specialty and are recorded at the date of purchase, which generally occurs   30   to   45   days after the accounts are billed. These purchased receivables are billed and collected by Athas, Peak, and First Assist and they retain   100%   of what is collected after paying the discounted purchase price. Following the transfer of the receivable, the transferor has no continued involvement and there are no restrictions on the receivables. Gross revenue from purchased receivables was   $4.6 million   and   $3.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Gross revenue from purchased receivables was   $11.2 million   and   $8.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Revenue, net of the discounted purchase price, was   $2.4 million   and   $1.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Revenue, net of the discounted purchase price, was   $5.9 million   and   $4.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Accounts receivable for purchased receivables was   $4.1 million   and   $2.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and year-ended   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Revenue from receivables purchased is recorded in the factoring revenue line item within the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
   
  NOTE 6   INVESTMENTS IN ASSOCIATES 
  During the first quarter of 2015, The Company completed the deconsolidation of two imaging centers and one urgent care clinic in Houston, which consisted of the following entities: Spring Northwest Management, LLC, Spring Northwest Operating, LLC, Willowbrook Imaging, LLC, GRIP Medical Diagnostics, LLC and KIRPA Holdings, LLC. The Company resigned as the manager of these facilities resulting in loss of control and its rights to exercise significant influence. The Company retained investments in these facilities that are accounted for as cost method investments beginning January 1, 2015. The carrying value as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was   $0.7 million  . The investments are classified as other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
  In March 2016, the Company acquired a   58%   interest in Athelite Holdings LLC ("Athelite"), a holding company with a   70%   interest in Dallas Metro Surgery Center LLC ("Dallas Metro"), a company formed to provide management services to a Hospital Outpatient Department ( HOPD ). In April 2016, Athelite interest in Dallas Metro was reduced to   62%  . The Athelite investment is accounted for as an equity method investment as the Company did not obtain the necessary level of control for the investment to be accounted for as a business combination. This is due to the fact that the Company does not have the ability to directly appoint a majority of the board members of Dallas Metro or independently make strategic operational decisions. The carrying value as of   September 30, 2016   was   $0.5 million  . The investment is classified as other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTE 7   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CONCENTRATION 
  In common with all other businesses, the Company is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments. This note describes the Company s objectives, policies and processes for managing those risks and the methods used to measure them. Further quantitative information in respect to these risks is presented throughout these consolidated financial statements. 
  Principal financial instruments 
  The principal financial instruments used by the Company, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows: 
             
    Accounts receivable and other receivables 
                
    Investments in associates 
                
    Accounts payable, accrued liabilities and other current liabilities 
                
    Other liabilities and notes payable 
                
    Capital leases 
                
    Lines of credit 
                
    Debt 
                
    Warrants 
                
    Non-employee stock options 
     The carrying amounts of the Company s cash, accounts receivable and other receivables, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, other current liabilities and other liabilities as reflected in the consolidated financial statements approximate fair value due to their short term maturity. The estimated fair value of the Company's other long-term debt instruments approximate their carrying amounts as the interest rates approximate the Company's current borrowing rate for similar debt instruments of comparable maturity, or have variable interest rates. 
  Financial instruments - risk management 
  The Company s financial instrument risks include, but are not limited to the following: 
             
    Credit risk 
                
    Fair value risk 
                
    Foreign exchange risk 
                
    Other market price risk 
                
    Liquidity risk 
                
    Interest rate risk 
     Credit risk 
  Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a patient, non-partner surgeon or insurance company fails to meet its contractual obligations. The Company, in the normal course of business, is exposed mainly to credit risk on its accounts receivable from insurance companies, other third-party payors, and physicians. Accounts receivables are net of applicable bad debt reserves, which are established based on specific credit risk associated with insurance companies, payors and other relevant information.  
  Liquidity risk 
  Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due and arises from the Company s management of working capital. The Company s objective to managing liquidity risk is to ensure that it will have sufficient cash to allow it to meet its liabilities when they become due. To achieve this objective, it seeks to maintain cash balances (or agreed credit facilities) to meet expected requirements. The liquidity risk of the Company and its subsidiaries is managed centrally by the Company s finance function. The Company believes that there are currently no concerns of its ability to meet its liabilities as they become due for the foreseeable future.

     Table of Contents  

The following tables set forth certain information with respect to the Company s payor concentration. Patient and net professional fee revenues by payor are summarized below for the applicable periods: 
  MEDICAL SEGMENT 

MARKETING SEGMENT 

CONSOLIDATED SEGMENTS 

Three facilities represent approximately   75.1%   and   83.0%   of the Company s contracted marketing revenue for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and three facilities represent approximately   83.6%   of the Company s contracted marketing accounts receivable as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Market risk 
  Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and/or foreign currency exchange rates. 
  Interest rate risk 
  The Company entered into a revolving line of credit that, from time to time, may increase interest rates based on market index. 
  Foreign exchange risk 
  Foreign exchange risk arises because the Company has certain expenses that are incurred in Canadian dollars.

     Table of Contents  

The Company is also exposed to currency risk on purchases made from vendors based in Canada. The Company has Canadian denominated cash ( Cdn ) of   $0.2 million   and a nominal amount of trade payables at   September 30, 2016  . The Company had Cdn of   $0.3 million   and a nominal amount of trade payables at   December 31, 2015  .  
   
  NOTE 8   ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES 
  The following table presents a summary of items comprising accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (  in thousands  ): 

NOTE 9   OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 
  The Company assumed real property leases as part of certain acquisitions which required the Company to pay above market rentals through the remainder of the lease terms. Of the   $3.5 million   balance in other long-term liabilities at   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $3.2 million   of that balance relates to unfavorable leases. The unfavorable lease liability is amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the contractual periods the Company is required to make rental payments under the leases.

  The HFS Term Loan primarily served to refinance all previously held debt and lines of credit. Debt issuance costs associated with the new credit facility approximated   $1.0 million  . The issuance costs are a direct deduction from the carrying value of the HFS Term Loan, amortized using the interest method and reported as interest expense on our statement of operations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance of the HFS Term Loan was   $24.7 million  . 
  The Company entered into the Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement (the "Sixth Amendment"), dated as of August 1, 2016, among Northstar Healthcare Acquisitions, L.L.C.

The Sixth Amendment among other things, added a cap on Investments in Nobilis Health Anesthesia Network, PLLC of   $2.0 million  ; increased the permitted indebtedness of the Company pursuant to that certain Loan Agreement, dated as of July 30, 2015, between PSH and Legacy Texas Bank from   7.0   to   7.05  ; modified the maximum leverage ratio as of March 31, 2016, to   3.05   to   1.00  ; and modified the definition of "Subsidiary" to exclude the following entities: Athelite, Dallas Metro, Marsh Lane Surgical Hospital, LLC, Nobilis Health Network, Inc. ("NHN") and the subsidiaries of NHN.  
  The Company entered into the Seventh Amendment, dated as of August 19, 2016, among HFS, other credit parties named therein and other financial institutions.  The Seventh Amendment, among other things, increased total borrowing capacity to   $36.6 million   from   $30.6 million  . The increased borrowing capacity provided under the Seventh Amendment consisted of aggregate term and revolving loan commitments from HFS of   $25 million   and   $11.6 million  , respectively.  
  The Seventh Amendment includes material financial covenants, ratios and tests.  The Company must maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of not more than   2.00   to 1.00 and a Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of at least   3.00   to 1.00.  Capital Lease Obligations allowed under the covenants increased from   $3.0 million   to   $6.1 million   and the HFS Term Loan's quarterly amortization payment increased under the Seventh Amendment from   $250,000   to   $312,500   per quarter.  
  The Company entered into the Eighth Amendment to Credit Agreement and Limited Waiver (the "Eighth Amendment"), dated as of October 20, 2016, by and among NHA, other credit parties named therein, HFS and other financial institutions.

NOTE 12   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  The Company measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis, including warrant and stock option derivative liabilities. There have been no transfers between fair value measurement levels during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The following table summarizes our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those measurements fall (  in thousands  ): 

In certain cases, where there is limited activity or less transparency around inputs to valuation, securities are classified as Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy. Level 3 liabilities that were measured at estimated fair value on a recurring basis consist of warrant and stock option derivative liabilities. The estimated fair values of the warrant and stock option derivative liabilities were measured using the Black-Scholes valuation model (refer to   Note 14 - Warrants and options liabilities  ). Due to the nature of valuation inputs, the valuation of the warrants is considered a Level 3 measurement. 
   
  NOTE 13   SHARE BASED COMPENSATION 
  Restricted Share Units ( RSUs ) 
  The Company had no stock compensation expense relative to RSUs for both the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company recorded stock compensation expense relative to RSUs of   nil   and   $5.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. There were   no   grants during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, two key executives experienced triggering events, as defined in their employee agreements, which accelerated all unrecognized stock compensation expense on their outstanding RSUs. As a result of this acceleration, the Company recognized   $4.5 million   of stock compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  The Company had   no   outstanding RSUs at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Stock Options 
  The Company granted a total of   350,000   and   2,457,075   stock options during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Of the options granted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   297,075   of those vest immediately and   2,160,000   vest ratably over a   three  -year period. 
  The Company granted a total of   3,166,782   stock options during the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Of the options granted during the year ended   December 31, 2015  ,   451,782   of those vest immediately,   450,000   vest ratably over a   one  -year period,   1,865,000   vest ratably over a   three  -year period, and   400,000   cliff vest at the end of a   five  -year period.

The following table summarizes stock option activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The above table includes   650,000   options issued to non-employees, all of which are still outstanding at   September 30, 2016  . Refer to   Note 14 - Warrants and options liabilities   for discussion regarding the classification of these options within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
  The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was   $1.3 million   and   $2.9 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The total intrinsic value for all in-the-money vested outstanding stock options at   September 30, 2016   was   $1.8 million  . Assuming all stock options outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were vested, the total intrinsic value of in-the-money outstanding stock options would have been   $4.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company recorded total stock compensation expense relative to employee stock options of   $1.6 million   and   $1.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $5.0 million   and   $4.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The fair values of the employee stock options used in recording compensation expense are computed using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The table below shows the assumptions used in the model for options awarded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

For stock options, the Company recognizes share-based compensation net of estimated forfeitures and revises the estimates in the subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates. Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical experience as well as expected future behavior.

NOTE 14   WARRANTS AND OPTIONS LIABILITIES 
  Warrants and Options Issued in Private Placements 
  The Company issued warrants and compensatory options in connection with private placements completed in December 2013, September 2014 and May 2015. These warrants and options have exercise prices denominated in Canadian dollars and as such may not be considered indexed to our stock which is valued in U.S. dollars. Hence, these warrants and options are classified as liabilities under the caption  Warrants and Options Derivative Liability  and recorded at estimated fair value at each reporting date, computed using the Black-Scholes valuation method. Changes in the liability from period to period are recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under the caption  Change in fair value of warrant and stock option derivative liabilities . 
  The estimated fair values of warrants and options accounted for as liabilities were determined on the date of the private placements and at each balance sheet date following using the Black Scholes pricing model with the following inputs: 

The changes in fair value of the warrants and options (excluding non-employees) liability during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (  in thousands  ): 

The following warrants and options were outstanding at   September 30, 2016  : 

As of September 30, 2016, there were   no   warrants or options outstanding from the 2014 issuances. 
  Options Issued to Non-Employees 
  As discussed in   Note 13 - Share based compensation  , in 2014 the Company issued options to professionals providing services to the organization. These professionals do not meet the definition of an employee under U.S. GAAP. At   September 30, 2016  , there were   650,000   options outstanding to these non-employees. 
  Under U.S. GAAP, the value of these option awards is determined at the performance completion date. The Company recognizes expense for the estimated total value of the awards during the period from their issuance until performance completion since the professional services are being rendered during this time. The total expense recognized is adjusted to the final value of the award as determined on the performance completion date.

The estimated values of the option awards are determined using the Black Scholes pricing model with the following inputs: 

For the three month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company recorded expense for non-employee stock options of   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded expense for non-employee stock options of   $0.2 million   and   $2.8 million  , respectively. 
  The changes in fair value of the liability related to vested yet un-exercised options issued to non-employees during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows   (in thousands)  : 

Options issued to non-employees are reclassified from equity to liabilities on the performance completion date. Under U.S. GAAP, such options may not be considered indexed to our stock because they have exercise prices denominated in Canadian dollars. Hence, these will be classified as liabilities under the caption  Warrant and stock option liabilities  and recorded at estimated fair value at each reporting date, computed using the Black-Scholes valuation method. Changes in the liability from period to period will be recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under the caption  Change in fair value of warrant and stock option liabilities . At   September 30, 2016  , there were   0.6 million   unexercised non-employee options requiring liability classification.

NOTE 16   NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
  Noncontrolling interests at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   represent an   8.1%   interest in The Palladium for Surgery - Houston, Ltd,   75%   interest in the Medical Ambulatory Suites, L.P.,   65%   interest in Microsurgery Institute, LLC.,   2.3%   interest in Houston Microsurgery Institute, LLC.,   50%   in Northstar Healthcare Dallas Management, LLC.,   65%   in NHC ASC   Dallas, LLC.,   49%   in First Nobilis, LLC.,   40%   in First Nobilis Hospital Management, LLC.,   45%   in Hermann Drive Surgical Hospital, LP., and   40%   in Perimeter Road Surgical Hospital, LLC. 
  Agreements with the third party equity owners in NHC - ASC Dallas and First Nobilis give these owners limited rights to require the Company to repurchase their equity interests upon the occurrence of certain events, none of which were probable of occurring as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The contingently redeemable noncontrolling interests associated with these entities are classified in the Company s Consolidated Balance Sheets as  temporary  or mezzanine equity. Changes in contingently redeemable noncontrolling interests are as follows (  in thousands  ): 

Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries that are less than wholly owned meet the definition of a Variable Interest Entity ( VIE ), and we hold voting interests in all such entities. We consolidate the activities of VIE s for which we are the primary beneficiary. In order to determine whether we own a variable interest in a VIE, we perform qualitative analysis of the entity s design, organizational structure, primary decision makers and relevant agreements. Such variable interests include our voting interests, and may also include other interests and rights, including those gained through management contracts. 
  Since our core business is the management and operation of health care facilities, our subsidiaries that are determined to be VIE s represent entities that own, manage and operate such facilities. Voting interests in such entities are typically owned by us, by physicians practicing at these facilities (or entities controlled by them) and other parties associated with the operation of the facilities. In forming such entities, we typically seek to retain operational control and, as a result, in some cases, voting rights we hold are not proportionate to the economic share of our ownership in these entities, which causes them to meet the VIE definition. We consolidate such VIE s if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary because (i) we have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE via our rights and obligations associated with the management and operation of the VIE s health care facilities, and (ii) as a result of our obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant to the VIE, which we have through our equity interests.

NOTE 17   INCOME TAXES  
  The Company is a corporation subject to federal income tax at a statutory rate of   35%   of pretax earnings. The Company estimates an annual effective income tax rate of   32.5%   for U.S. and none for Canada based on projected results for the year and applies this rate to income before taxes to calculate income tax expense. The following items caused the   third   quarter effective income tax rate to be significantly different from the statutory rate: 
             
    Canada is excluded from the worldwide annual effective tax rate calculation because Canada has losses but does not expect to realize them, which reduces the   third   quarter effective tax rate by approximately   3.8%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
                
    All of the Partnership s earnings are included in the Company s net income; however, the Company is not required to record income tax expense or benefit with respect to the portion of the Partnership s earnings allocated to its noncontrolling public limited partners, which reduces the   third   quarter effective tax rate by approximately   4.5%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
                
    The Company adjusted the prior year tax provision. The adjustment to the existing deferred tax assets and liabilities decreases the   third   quarter effective tax rate by approximately   1.6%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
                
    The third quarter effective tax rate includes a discrete item for the stock compensation shortfall, which reduces the effective tax rate by approximately   3.8%   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
                
    The net tax for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.5 million   expense and   $1.7 million   benefit, respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately -  29.3%   and   21.1%   respectively. The net tax includes   $0.3 million   and   $0.8 million   of state tax expense, respectively. The Company did not recognize any federal or foreign tax expense or benefit for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as the Company had a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at that time. The state tax expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $0.3 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively. 
     On April 22, 2016, the Company received notification from the Internal Revenue Service to examine our   December 31, 2014   and   2013   Federal income tax return. Based on management tax analysis, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions as of   September 30, 2016  .

NOTE 20   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  Litigation 
  In the normal course of our business, we are subject to legal proceedings brought by or against us and our subsidiaries. In the opinion of management, the amount of ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially impact the financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. 
  Shareholder Lawsuits 
  After the Company announced it would be restating its 2014 annual financial statements and 2015 first and second quarter interim financial statements, one complaint, Schott v. Nobilis Health Corp. et al, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas against the Company, our former chief executive officer and our current chief financial officer. The complaint sought class action status on behalf of our shareholders and alleges violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 arising out of the restatement. The defendants vigorously defended against these claims and filed motions to dismiss the consolidated complaint for failure to plead particularized facts supporting a strong inference of scienter on the part of the individual defendants.On June 1, 2016 the court heard oral arguments on the Company s pending motion to dismiss which the court later granted on September 29, 2016.  The court ultimately dismissed the case with prejudice on October 24, 2016.  
  In addition, a statement of claim (complaint), Vince Capelli v Nobilis Health Corp. et. al, was filed on January 8, 2016 in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice under court file number CV-16-544173 naming Nobilis Health Corp., certain current and former officers and the Company s former auditors as defendants. The statement of claim seeks to advance claims on behalf of the plaintiff and on behalf of a class comprised of certain of our shareholders related to, among other things, alleged certain violations of the Ontario Securities Act and seeks damages in the amount of   C$80 million   plus interest. The defendants intend to vigorously defend against these claims.  At this time the Company believes the likelihood of loss, if any, is remote.

  On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into an   $82.5 million   credit agreement (the  Compass Bank Loans ) with Compass Bank.  The credit agreement includes a   $52.5 million   term loan and a   $30.0 million   revolving credit facility.  The proceeds will be used to refinance all previously held debt and lines of credit and for the acquisition of Arizona Vein and Vascular Centers.  As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the HFS Term Loan and Revolver was   $24.7 million   and   $8.1 million  , respectively.  The Compass Bank loans are collateralized by the accounts receivable and physical equipment of all of the Company s 100% owned subsidiaries as well as the Company s ownership interest in all less than wholly owned subsidiaries.  The Compass Bank Loans require the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of   2.75   to 1.00 through September 30, 2018,   2.50   to 1.00 for December 31, 2018 to September 30, 2019,   2.25   to 1.00 for December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020 and   2.00   to 1.00 through December 31, 2020; and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of   2.00   to 1.00.

Executive Overview 
  Our operations consist of two reportable business segments, the Medical Segment and the Marketing Segment, each of which is described in more detail in the following paragraphs. Our Medical Segment owns and/or manages outpatient surgery centers and surgical hospitals. It focuses on improving patient outcomes by providing minimally invasive procedures that can be performed in low-cost, outpatient settings. Our business also utilizes innovative direct-to-patient marketing and proprietary technologies to drive patient engagement and education. Our Marketing Segment provides these services to the facilities that comprise our Medical Segment; we also provide these services to third parties as a stand-alone business line, which is a separate reportable business segment. 
  Medical Segment  
  Our Medical Segment broadly includes our ownership and operation of healthcare facilities (the  Nobilis Facilities ) (which include outpatient surgery centers and hospitals) and ancillary service providers ( Nobilis Ancillary Service Lines ). 
  There are nine Nobilis Facilities, consisting of four hospitals (three in Texas and one in Arizona) and five ambulatory surgery centers (three in Houston, Texas, one in Dallas, Texas and one in Scottsdale, Arizona). We earn revenue in our Medical Segment from the  facility fees  or  technical fees  from third party payors or patients for the services rendered at the Nobilis Facilities. The Nobilis Facilities are each licensed in the state where they are located and provide surgical procedures in a limited number of clinical specialties, which enables them to develop routines, procedures and protocols to maximize operating efficiency and productivity while offering an enhanced healthcare experience for both physicians and patients. These clinical specialties include orthopedic surgery, podiatric surgery, ear nose and throat ( ENT ) surgery, pain management, gastro-intestinal surgery, gynecology and general surgery. The Nobilis ASCs do not offer the full range of services typically found in traditional hospitals, allowing the Nobilis ASCs to operate with lower operating expenses. The Nobilis Hospitals do offer the services typically found in traditional hospitals and, as a result, have ability to take on more complex cases and cases that may require an overnight stay. 
  There are three Nobilis Ancillary Service Lines: intraoperative monitoring, surgical assist and anesthesia. Peak Neuromonitoring, a wholly owned subsidiary, oversees our intraoperative monitoring service line, and Nobilis Surgical Assist oversees our surgical assist service line. There are several small subsidiaries through which we provide anesthesia services.  In the third quarter of 2016,   we added laboratory services. 
  Marketing Segment  
  Our Marketing Segment provides marketing services, patient education services and patient care coordination management services to the Nobilis Facilities, to third party facilities in states where we currently do not operate, and to physicians. We market several minimally-invasive medical procedures and brands, which include the following:  
             
    North American Spine: promotion of minimally invasive spine procedures (pain management musculoskeletal, musculoskeletal and spine); 
                
    Migraine Treatment Centers of America: promotion of procedures related to chronic migraine pain (interventional headache procedure); 
                
    NueStep: promotion of surgical procedures designed to treat pain in the foot, ankle and leg (podiatry); 
                
    Evolve-The Experts in Weight Loss Surgery: promotion of surgical weight loss procedures (bariatrics); 
                
    Minimally Invasive Reproductive Surgery Institute ( MIRI ): promotion of women s health related procedures; and 
                
    Onward Orthopedics: promotion of general orthopedics, sports medicine related to orthopedics (orthopedics and pain management interventions); 
                
    Clarity Vein and Vascular:  promotion of cosmetic and medical vein and vascular treatments. 
     Our Marketing Segment does not directly provide medical services to patients; rather, we identify candidates for our branded procedures, educate these potential patients about the relevant procedure and direct those patients to affiliated physicians who diagnose and treat those patients at affiliated facilities. Through our Marketing Segment, we have contractual relationships with facilities and physicians in several states.  
  We earn service fees from our partner facilities that, depending on the laws of the state in which a partner facility is located, are either charged as a flat monthly fee or are calculated based on a portion of the  facility fee  revenue generated by the partner facility for a given procedure.  
  Our revenues from physician-related services are, depending on the laws of the state in which a partner-physician practices, either earned directly from professional fees or through the purchase of accounts receivable. In Texas, we engage physicians through  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

entities exempt from Texas corporate practice of medicine laws that directly earn professional fees for partner-physician services and, in turn, pay partner-physicians a reasonable fee for rendering those professional services. In other states, we manage our partner-physicians  practices and purchase the accounts receivable of those practices through accounts receivable purchase agreements.  
   
  Recent Developments 
  Compass Bank Loans 
    
  On October 28, 2016, the Company entered into a $82.5 million credit agreement (the  Compass Bank Loans ) with Compass Bank.  The credit agreement includes a $52.5 million term loan and a $30.0 million revolving credit facility.  The proceeds will be used to refinance all previously held debt and lines of credit and for the acquisition of Arizona Vein and Vascular Centers.  As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the HFS Term Loan and Revolver was   $24.7 million   and   $8.1 million  , respectively.  The Compass Bank loans are collateralized by the accounts receivable and physical equipment of all of the Company s 100% owned subsidiaries as well as the Company s ownership interest in all less than wholly owned subsidiaries.  The Compass Bank Loans require the Company to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of 2.75 to 1.00 through September 30, 2018, 2.50 to 1.00 for December 31, 2018 to September 30, 2019, 2.25 to 1.00 for December 31, 2019 to September 30, 2020 and 2.00 to 1.00 through December 31, 2020; and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00.   
    
  The Compass Bank Loans bear interest from the closing date to the first business day immediately following the date on which Compass Bank receives a compliance certificate from the Company for the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2017; 2.75% per annum for base rate loans, 3.75% per annum for Eurodollar Rate Loans, 3.75% for line of credit fees, and 0.500% per annum for the commitment fee.  Thereafter, the Compass Bank Loans bear interest based on the Company s consolidated leverage ratio as follows:  (i) Less than 1.00 to 1.00; base rate margin 2.00%, LIBOR margin 3.00%, commitment fee rate 0.375%, (ii) Less than 1.75 to 1.00 but greater than or equal to 1.00 to 1.00; base rate margin 2.25%, LIBOR margin 3.25%, commitment fee rate 0.375%, (iii) Less than 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than or equal to 1.75 to 1.00; base rate margin 2.50%, LIBOR margin 3.50%, commitment fee rate 0.450%, (iv) Greater than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00; base rate margin 2.75%, LIBOR margin 3.75%, commitment fee rate 0.500%.   
    
  The Compass Bank term loan requires quarterly payments of Principal as follows: (i) March 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018 of $0.7 million, (ii) March 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020 of $1.3 million, (iii) March 31, 2021 to September 30, 2021 of $2.0 million, (iv) October 28, 2016, the remaining principal balance of the term.   The Compass Bank Loans mature on October 28, 2021. 
    
  Acquisition of Arizona Vein and Vascular 
    
  In connection with the funding of the Compass Bank Loans, the Company also completed the acquisition of the operating assets of Arizona Center for Minimally Invasive Surgery, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company ( ACMIS ), L. Philipp Wall, M.D., P.C., an Arizona professional corporation ( PC ), Arizona Vein   Vascular Center, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of PC, ( AVVC  and with ACMIS and PC, each a  Seller  and collectively  Sellers ), and L. Philipp Wall ( Owner ). The Company, Northstar Healthcare Acquisitions, L.L.C. ("Buyer"), Sellers and Owner entered into an amended and restated purchase agreement (the  Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement ) dated as of October 28, 2016.  
    
  Buyer received substantially all of the operating assets of Sellers in exchange for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $22 million, consisting of $17 million in cash (subject to a holdback described below), $2.5 million of the Company's common shares, and $2.5 million the form of a convertible promissory note ( Convertible Promissory Note ) between Buyer and ACMIS.  
    
  In addition, the Sellers may receive an additional earnout payment based on the growth in trailing twelve month EBITDA of the new vascular division on the twelve-month anniversary of closing (as compared to the trailing twelve month EBITDA for the twelve months prior to closing).  The earnout payment shall be equal to fifty percent (50%) of such growth. 
    
  As part of the Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement, $1.05 million of the cash purchase price was held back and is subject to the Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement s indemnification provisions. On the twelve-month anniversary of closing, fifty percent (50%) of the amount held back, less any amounts paid as, or claimed as, indemnification, will be paid to the Owner. The remaining amounts held back, less any amounts paid as, or claimed as, indemnification, will be paid to the Owner on the twenty-four-month anniversary of closing.

The common shares issued to Owner at closing were issued at a price per share based on the NYSE MKT closing price of our common shares on the day prior to closing. The common shares are restricted under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and are subject to additional contractual lock-up provisions, which lift in one-quarter increments on the twelve-month, fifteen-month, eighteen-month and twenty-first month anniversaries of closing.    
  See Part I, Item 1- Financial Statements,   Note 21 - Subsequent events    of this Quarterly Report for more information on the Compass Bank Loans and the Transaction. 
  We recently partnered with a group purchasing organization (GPO) who maintains over $28.5 billion purchasing power and provides us access to the highest quality of products and industry leading contract pricing from suppliers.  The GPO will partner with us to drive best operating and clinical practices, and accelerate cost savings across the Nobilis Facilities.  The agreement contemplates immediate contract value from the GPO's committed portfolio as well as access to clinical and sourcing experts that will be closely integrated with the our service lines, operations and supply chain leadership.  
  Seasonality of the Business    
  The surgical segment of the healthcare industry tends to be impacted by seasonality because most benefit plans reset on a calendar year basis. As patients utilize and reduce their remaining deductible, surgical ASCs and hospitals typically experience an increase in volume throughout the year, with the biggest impact coming in the fourth quarter. Historically, approximately   35%   -   40%   of our annual revenues have been recognized in the fourth quarter.  
   
  Operating Environment 
  The Medical Segment depends primarily upon third-party reimbursement from private insurers to pay for substantially all of the services rendered to our patients. The majority of the revenues attributable to the Medical Segment are from reimbursement to the Nobilis Hospitals and Nobilis ASCs as  out-of-network  providers. This means the Nobilis Facilities are not contracted with a major medical insurer as an  in-network  participant. Participation in such networks offer the benefit of larger patient populations and defined, predictable payment rates. The reimbursement to in-network providers, however, is typically far less than that paid to out of network providers. To a far lesser degree, the Nobilis Facilities earn fees from governmental payor programs such as Medicare. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we derived approximately 0.2% and   0.3%   for the respective periods 2016, and 0.4% and   0.5%   for 2015 of our Medical Segment s net revenues from governmental healthcare programs, primarily Medicare and managed Medicare programs, and the remainder from a wide mix of commercial payers and patient co-pays, coinsurance, and deductibles.  
  We receive a relatively small amount of revenue from Medicare. We also receive a relatively small portion of revenue directly from uninsured patients, who pay out of pocket for the services they receive. Insured patients are responsible for services not covered by their health insurance plans, deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance obligations under their plans. The amount of these deductibles, co-payments and coinsurance obligations has increased in recent years but does not represent a material component of the revenue generated by the Nobilis Facilities. The surgical center fees of the Nobilis Facilities are generated by the physician limited partners and the other physicians who utilize the Nobilis Facilities to provide services. 
  Revenue Model and Case Mix 
  Revenues earned by the Nobilis Facilities vary depending on the procedures performed. For every medical procedure performed there are usually three separately invoiced patient billings: 
             
    the surgical center fee for the use of infrastructure, surgical equipment, nursing staff, non-surgical professional services, supplies and other support services, which is earned by the Nobilis Facilities; 
                
    the professional fee, which is separately earned, billed and collected by the physician performing the procedure, separate and apart from the fees charged by the Nobilis Facilities; and 
                
    the anesthesiology fee, which is separately earned, billed and collected by the anesthesia provider, separate and apart from the fees charged by the Nobilis Facilities and the physicians. 
     Overall facility revenue depends on procedure volume, case mix and payment rates of the respective payors.

Depreciation and Amortization    
  Depreciation for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $2.0 million  , an   increase   of   $0.5 million   or   34.8%  , compared to $1.5 million the prior corresponding period. This increase is primarily due to an increase in property and equipment acquired through our purchase of three hospitals. 
  Total Corporate Costs    
  To illustrate our operational efficiency, corporate costs are presented separate of operating expenses of the revenue generating facilities. Corporate costs totaled   $8.0 million  , an   increase   of   $0.7 million   or   9.0%  , compared to $7.3 million in the prior corresponding period. Salaries and benefits for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $1.8 million  , an   increase   of   $0.2 million   or   14.6%  , compared to $1.5 million from the prior corresponding period. The $0.2 million   increase   is due to the hiring of additional corporate staff in 2016 related to accounting, finance and information technology. Legal expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $1.5 million  , an   increase   of   $1.0 million   or   194.6%  , compared to $0.5 in from the prior corresponding period. The   increase   in legal expenses was attributable to litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $4.6 million  , a   decrease   of   $0.6 million   or   11.9%  , compared to   $5.2 million   in the prior corresponding period. The   decrease   in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a decline in non-cash compensation expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Other Expense     (Income) 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   $0.7 million   of other expense compared to   $10.5 million   of other income.  The change primarily related to a change in warrant and stock option derivative liability of   $6.5 million  .  These warrants and options have exercise prices denominated in Canadian dollars and as such may not be considered indexed to our stock which is valued in U.S. dollars and therefore recorded as derivative liabilities. Change in fair value of warrant and stock option derivative liabilities are a result of adjusting the estimated fair value at the end of the period, using the Black-Scholes Model.  
  There was a change of   $4.4 million   bargain purchase gain in the prior period related the acquisition of one of our facilities.  
  Lastly, interest expense increased   $0.4 million   as a result of average increase in borrowings and amortization of debt issuance costs.   
  Income tax expense    
  The net tax expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was $0.5 million, compared to $0.3 million from the prior corresponding period. The temporary differences attributable to the projected taxable income include goodwill amortization, net operating loss carryforward-U.S. and other accrued liabilities. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate differs from the annual tax rate primarily due to equity compensation, return to provision true-ups, Canada's loss that we do not expect to realize, and noncontrolling interests. The Company s state tax expense was $0.3 million for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  . Our effective tax rate during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately -29.3%. The Company estimates an annual effective income tax rate of 32.5% for U.S., and none for Canada, based on projected results for the year.  
  Noncontrolling Interests 
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests are based on ownership percentages in the Nobilis Facilities that are owned by third parties.

INN - ONN CONRACT MIX OF TOTAL MEDICAL CASES PERFORMED 
  The following table sets out the contract mix of cases performed that were in network ( INN ) compared to cases performed that were out of network ( OON ) at our Medical Segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  

Revenues  
  Revenues for the Medical Segment   increased   by   $19.2 million   to   $65.4 million  , or   41.5%   compared to   $46.2 million   from the prior corresponding period. Net service patient revenues   increased     $1,864   per case period over period.  Revenues increased primarily due to a 12% increase in the Medical Segment's case volume, and higher acuity cases performed in hospitals receiving larger reimbursements. New center facilities for the Medical Segment   increased     $19.7 million   or   271.1%   and we added   1,293   cases or   214.8%   primarily due to the acquisition of three hospitals in 2015. Same center facilities for the Medical Segment   decreased     $0.5 million   or   1.2%   and cases declined by   409   cases or   11.9%   primarily attributable to a decline in ASC revenue, due to the closing of operations of an ASC in Dallas, whose cases were shifted to one of our acquired hospitals.   
  Salaries and Benefits    
  Salaries and Benefits for the Medical Segment   increased   by   $2.4 million   to   $10.5 million  , or   29.4%   compared to   $8.2 million   from the prior corresponding period. The staffing costs for the Medical Segment at new facilities accounted for   $3.1 million   of the   increase  , while the remaining   $0.7 million     decrease   is attributable to staffing at same center facilities driven by case volume declines due to cases being shifted to one of our new hospitals. Operating salaries and benefits   increased   primarily due to the acquisition of hospitals in 2015 and the additional facility resources required to accommodate the increase in cases over prior year.    
  Drugs and Supplies    
  Drugs and supplies expense for the Medical Segment   increased   by   $6.8 million   to   $14.9 million  , or   83.7%   compared to   $8.1 million   from the prior corresponding period. Medical supplies costs for the Medical Segment at new facilities accounted for   $6.8 million   of the   increase  .  Drugs and supplies   increased   compared to the prior corresponding period primarily due to the acquisition of three hospitals in 2015. Hospitals require higher drugs and supply costs than ASCs as a result of performing more complex and higher acuity cases.  
  General and Administrative    
  General and administrative expense for the Medical Segment increased by   $16.2 million   to   $34.3 million  , or   88.9%   compared to   $18.2 million  . The Medical Segment new facilities contributed   $11.4 million   of the   increase   while the remaining   $4.8 million     increase   was attributable to same center facilities. The   increase   in the Medical Segment is due to an   increase   in marketing expenses, and operations associated with Medical Segment facilities, primarily due to the acquisition of hospitals in 2015 and expenses associated with our new lab service line.  We accelerated our marketing expense, by deploying a portion of the fourth quarter's marketing budget in the third quarter, related to digital online, social media and direct response television.  The marketing expense acceleration allowed us to avoid higher fourth quarter premiums as a result of the presidential election, continue our strategic growth initiatives and the marketing of our specialty services to hospitals acquired in 2015.  In addition, during the third quarter of 2016 we increased our physician marketing expense by adding several new physicians to our direct to consumer marketing program in an effort to drive additional cases in the fourth quarter of 2016, our seasonably highest quarter. 
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , marketing expenses allocated to the Medical Segment   increased   by   $6.2 million   to   $13.5 million  , compared to   $7.3 million   for the corresponding period. These marketing cost are allocated from our Marketing Segment for cases performed at Nobilis Facilities.  The acquisition of hospitals allows us to send more cases to owned facilities, resulting in larger allocations of marketing expense from our Marketing Segment to our Medical Segment.  As a result, there was a decrease in general and administrative costs within our Marketing Segment, discussed later herein.

     Table of Contents  

of 2016 management drove more cases to Nobilis owned facilities in the Medical Segment.  Revenues increased   $15,238   per case period over period, primarily attributable to higher concentrations of OON cases. 
    
  Salaries and Benefits    
  Salaries and benefits for the Marketing Segment   increased     $0.5 million   to   $2.6 million   compared to   $2.1 million   from the prior period primarily due to headcount increases to support the continued strategic growth initiatives for expansion related to marketing our specialty programs to two hospitals acquired in 2015.    
  General and Administrative    
  General and administrative expense for the Marketing Segment   decreased   by   $4.0 million   compared to   $2.8 million   for the corresponding period. Marketing costs are allocated to our Medical Segment for cases performed at Nobilis Facilities. The decrease in the Marketing Segment's general and administrative expense is attributable to driving cases to our Nobilis facilities. The acquisition of hospitals allows us to send more cases to owned facilities, resulting in larger allocations of marketing expense from our Marketing Segment to our Medical Segment.  As a result, we see a decrease in general and administrative costs within our Marketing Segment, discussed later herein.

  Operating general and administrative expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $85.7 million  , an   increase   of   $31.1 million  , or   56.8%  , compared to   $54.6 million   from the prior corresponding period. The Medical Segment accounted for   $34.1 million   of the   increase  , offset by a   decrease   of   $3.0 million   in the Marketing Segment.   
  Depreciation and Amortization    
  Operating depreciation for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $6.5 million  , an   increase   of   $3.4 million   or   110.7%  , compared to   $3.1 million   from the prior corresponding period. This increase is primarily due to an increase in property and equipment   acquired through our purchase of hospitals. 
  Total Corporate Costs    
  To illustrate our operational efficiency, corporate costs are presented separate of operating expenses of the revenue generating facilities. Corporate costs for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $24.4 million  , an   increase   of   $1.3 million   or   5.7%  , compared to   $23.1 million   from the prior corresponding period.

The   increase   in salaries and benefits is due to the hiring of additional corporate staff in 2016 related to accounting, finance and information technology.  Legal expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $4.1 million  , an   increase   of   $2.4 million   or   137.2%  , compared to   $1.7 million   from the prior corresponding period. The   increase   in legal expenses was attributable to increased litigation expenses. General and administrative expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , totaled   $15.0 million  , a   decrease   of   $2.7 million   or   15.4%  , compared to   $17.7 million   from the prior corresponding period. The   decrease   in general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to a decline in non-cash compensation expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , partially offset by an increase in insurance and corporate marketing expense.  
  Other (Income) Expense    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized   $2.5 million   of other income compared to   $9.4 million   from the corresponding prior period.    The change primarily related to a decrease in warrant and stock option derivative liability of $3.1 million.  These warrants and options have exercise prices denominated in Canadian dollars and as such may not be considered indexed to our stock which is valued in U.S dollars and therefore recorded as derivative liabilities. Change in fair value of warrant and stock option derivative liabilities are a result of adjusting the estimated fair value at the end of the period, using the Black-Scholes Model.  
  There was a change of   $4.4 million   bargain purchase gain in the prior period related to the acquisition of one of our facilities.  Other income and a change in warrant and option liability fair value of $3.1 million for the prior corresponding period.  
  Lastly, interest expense increased $1.0 million as a result of average increase in borrowings and amortization of debt issuance costs.   
  Income tax (benefit) expense    
  The net tax benefit for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was $1.7 million, compared to an income tax expense of $0.9 million from the prior corresponding period. The temporary differences attributable to the projected taxable income include goodwill amortization, net operating loss carryforward-U.S. and other accrued liabilities. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the effective tax rate differs from the annual tax rate primarily due to a reduction of 3.8 % due to equity compensation, a 1.6% effective deferred tax rate change, a 3.8% change attributable to Canada's loss that we do not expect to realize and a 4.5% change attributable to noncontrolling interests. The Company s state tax expense was $0.9 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Our effective tax rate during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately 21.1%. The Company estimates an annual effective income tax rate of 32.5% for U.S., and none for Canada, based on projected results for the year.  
  Noncontrolling Interests    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests are based on ownership percentages in the Nobilis Facilities that are owned by third parties.

     Table of Contents  

more cases to Nobilis owned facilities in the Medical Segment.  The Marketing Segment's Revenues per case   increased     $9,399   period over period, primarily attributable to higher concentrations of OON cases.  

Salaries and Benefits    
  Salaries and benefits for the Marketing Segment   increased     $0.8 million   to   $7.3 million  , or   11.5%   compared to   $6.5 million   period over period primarily due to headcount increases to support the continued strategic growth initiatives related to marketing our specialty programs to hospitals acquired in 2015.

As a result, we see a decrease in general and administrative costs within our Marketing Segment, discussed herein. 
   
  Balance Sheet 
  The Company experienced material variances in certain balance sheet accounts as discussed herein. 
  Trade Accounts Receivable, net 
  Accounts receivable as of   September 30, 2016  , totaled   $86.2 million  , a   decrease   of   $6.4 million   or   6.9%  , compared to   $92.6 million   for the year-ended December 31, 2015. The decrease is a result of strong collections for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We are dependent upon cash generated from our operations, which is the major source of financing for our operations and for meeting our contractual obligations. We currently believe we have adequate liquidity to fund operations during the near term through the generation of operating cash flows, cash on hand and access to our senior secured revolving credit facility provided under the Loan Agreement. Our ability to borrow funds under this Loan Agreement is subject to, among other things, the financial viability of the participating financial institutions. While we do not anticipate any of our current lenders defaulting on their obligations, we are unable to provide assurance that any particular lender will not default at a future date. 
  Cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 were   $19.6 million   and   $15.7 million  , respectively. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company experienced an   increase   in net cash provided by operating activities of   $6.5 million   attributable to a decrease in trade accounts receivable due to lower case volume during the period due to seasonality and cash collections on 2015 accounts. The Company experienced a   decrease   in net cash used for investing activities of   $1.8 million   attributable to the purchase of property and equipment and an investment in a surgical facility management company. Net cash used for financing activities   decreased   by   $17.9 million   primarily due to proceeds from a one-time private placement in 2015, which did not reoccur in 2016. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had consolidated net working capital of   $61.8 million   compared to   $63.7 million   as of December 31, 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a net decrease of accounts receivable and accounts payable. 
  We have a   $25.0 million   debt financing facility with Healthcare Financial Services, LLC ("HFS") (the successor in interest to General Electric Capital Corporation) (the  HFS Term Loan ). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement and ancillary agreements (collectively, the  Loan Agreement ), the HFS Term Loan bears interest at a rate of   4.0%   plus LIBOR per annum and amortizes over   20   years with required quarterly payments of principal and interest until the loan matures in March 2020. The revolving loan (the  HFS Revolver ) also bears interest at a rate of   4.0%   plus LIBOR per annum and amounts borrowed under the HFS Revolver may be repaid and re-borrowed periodically with a maturity of March 2020. The credit facility is collateralized by the accounts receivable and physical equipment of all 100% owned subsidiaries as well as the Company s ownership interest in all less-than-wholly owned subsidiaries.

  We entered into the Eighth Amendment to Credit Agreement and Limited Waiver, (the "Eighth Amendment"), dated as of October 20, 2016, by and among NHA, other credit parties named therein, HFS and other financial institutions.  The purpose of the Amendment was to (i) modify the covenant regarding the Company s holding company status to permit certain business activities thereunder (ii) define a new permitted lien and an applicable basket with regard to a lien filed by a Company vendor and (iii) amend the management fees covenant to permit payment of certain management fees under the Loan Agreement. As a result, the Company was in compliance with its covenants under the HFS Term Loan as of September 30, 2016. 
  On July 30, 2015, we secured a   $4.5 million   term loan from Legacy Texas Bank (the  Legacy Bank Term Loan ). The term loan bears interest at a rate of   4.0%   plus LIBOR per annum and requires monthly payments of interest. Monthly payments of principal will commence in August 2016. The Legacy Bank Term Loan matures in July 2020 and is subordinated to the Company s term loan and revolver with HFS. As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance was zero and the Legacy Bank Term Loan was extinguished using the increased borrowing capacity acquired through the Seventh Amendment.  
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our critical accounting policies are further described 2015 Annual Report. There have been no changes in the nature of our critical accounting policies or the application of those policies since December 31, 2015. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources other than operating leases disclosed in Note 15 included in Part II, Item 8  "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data  in our 2015 Annual Report.  
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  The following market risk disclosures should be read in conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Quarterly Report. 
  We are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing, investing and cash management activities. We do not, however, hold or issue financial instruments or derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. At   September 30, 2016  , the following components of our Loan Agreement bears interest at variable rates at specified margins above either the agent bank s alternate base rate or the LIBOR rate: (i) a $25 million, 5-year term loan; and (ii) an $11.6 million, 5-year revolving credit facility. 
  Although changes in the alternate base rate or the LIBOR rate would affect the cost of funds borrowed in the future, we believe the effect, if any, of reasonably possible near-term changes in interest rates on our remaining variable rate debt or our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows would not be material. Holding other variables constant, including levels of  
  
   46 

     Table of Contents  

indebtedness, a 0.125% increase in current interest rates would have no estimated impact on pre-tax earnings and cash flows for the next twelve month period given the 0.70215% LIBOR floor that exists in our Loan Agreement. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
  The Company holds cash balances in both U.S. and Canadian dollars. We transact most of our business in U.S. and Canadian dollars. As a result, currency exchange fluctuations may impact our operating costs. We do not manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk through the use of financial or derivative instruments, forward contracts or hedging activities. 
  In general, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar will positively impact our expenses transacted in Canadian dollars. Conversely, any weakening of the U.S dollar will increase our expenses transacted in Canadian dollars. We do not believe that any weakening of the U.S. dollar as compared to the Canadian dollar will have an adverse material effect on our operations. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  The Company s investment policy for its cash and cash equivalents is focused on the preservation of capital and supporting the liquidity requirements of the Company. The Company s interest earned on its cash balances is impacted on the fluctuations of U.S. and Canadian interest rates. We do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes. We do not believe that interest rate fluctuations will have any effect on our operations. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, consisting of controls and other procedures designed to give reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our chief executive officer ( CEO ) and our chief financial officer ( CFO ), to allow timely decisions regarding such required disclosure. 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and our CFO, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, at the end of the period covered by this report (the  evaluation date ). In conducting its evaluation, management considered the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting described in Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures of our 2015 Annual Report.  
  We are currently working to remediate the material weaknesses identified in our 2015 Annual Report and in this Quarterly Report. As of the evaluation date, our CEO and CFO have concluded that we did not maintain disclosure controls and procedures that were effective in providing reasonable assurances that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange act of 1934 was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods prescribed by SEC rules and regulations, and that such information was not accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  In light of these material weaknesses, in preparing our financial statements as of and for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, we performed additional analyses and procedures to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
  Our management has been actively engaged in remediation efforts to address the material weaknesses, as well as other identified areas of risk. These remediation efforts, outlined below, are intended to address the identified material weaknesses and to enhance our overall control environment: 
             
    On July 9, 2015, we appointed Mr. Kenneth Klein to serve as the Company s Chief Financial Officer. Our previous CFO assumed other responsibilities with our accounting and finance organization. 
                
    On May 9, 2016, we appointed Mr. Marcos Rodriguez to serve as the Company s Chief Accounting Officer. 
                
    We strengthened our accounting and financial reporting group with the addition of several new professionals with knowledge, experience and training in the application of U.S. GAAP to our accounting and finance organization. We also engaged third party accountants during the fourth quarter of 2015 who are providing assistance with significant, infrequently occurring transactions. 
     
   47 

     Table of Contents  

We are currently reviewing and implementing remediation steps providing for more detailed supervisory review processes as part of our financial statement close process. 
                
    On September 21, 2015, we appointed Dr. Lee McMillian to serve as the Company s Vice President of Information Technology. This was a newly created position for the Company. 
                
    During the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016, we strengthened our information technology department by adding six information technology professionals with knowledge of security, networking and infrastructure. 
                
    We have also invested approximately $320 thousand in hardware and software upgrades. 
                
    As of January 2016, we implemented a process to review third party service providers  Service Organization Controls reports. 
                
    In February 2016, we implemented a control to periodically review the access granted in order to ensure that users of our information systems had the appropriate access relative to the user s job responsibilities. A new user access form was created that captured appropriate authorizations, not only for access to financial systems but for other sensitive systems as well. Furthermore, certain sensitive levels of access have been identified, which require further approvals from Company s management. 
                
    In February 2016, we created controls to ensure that policies and procedures are followed with respect to application change management in certain of the Company s proprietary software, which involves multiple levels of approval and periodic change management review. 
                
    In February 2016, we began restricting and maintaining network access accounts to only employees in the information technology department and implemented compensating controls, including periodic audits of network access. 
                
    During the third quarter of 2016, we engaged third party internal control consultants to perform a benchmarking review of our internal control environment and documentation. 
     Management believes that the foregoing efforts will effectively remediate the material weaknesses. As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may determine to take additional measures to address the material weaknesses or to modify the remediation plan described above. The material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until the enhanced controls have been tested and determined to be designed and operating effectively. 
  Our executive management team, together with our Board of Directors, is committed to achieving and maintaining a strong control environment, high ethical standards, and financial reporting integrity. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Except as discussed immediately above in the Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures, there has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
