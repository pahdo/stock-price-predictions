1.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ORGANIZATION 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Triumph Group, Inc. (the "Company") have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the interim financial information includes all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  The results of operations for the   three and six   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending   March 31, 2017  .  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and should be read in conjunction with the fiscal   2016   audited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended   March 31, 2016   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on May 27, 2016. 
    
  The Company designs, engineers, manufactures, repairs and overhauls a broad portfolio of aerostructures, aircraft components, accessories, subassemblies and systems.  The Company serves a broad, worldwide spectrum of the aviation industry, including original equipment manufacturers of commercial, regional, business and military aircraft and aircraft components, as well as commercial and regional airlines and air cargo carriers. 
  Effective April 1, 2016, the Company realigned into four reportable segments:  Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures, Precision Components and Product Support segments (see Note 12). 

2.      SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Revenue Recognition 
    
  Revenues are generally recognized in accordance with the contract terms when products are shipped, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured.  A significant portion of the Company s contracts are within the scope of the   Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts   topic of the Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605-35 and revenue and costs on contracts are recognized using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting.  Accounting for the revenue and profit on a contract requires estimates of (1) the contract value or total contract revenue, (2) the total costs at completion, which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred costs to date on the contract and the estimated costs to complete the contract s scope of work, and (3) the measurement of progress toward completion.  Depending on the contract, the Company measures progress toward completion using either the cost-to-cost method or the units-of-delivery method of accounting, with the great majority measured under the units-of-delivery method of accounting.   

Under the cost-to-cost method of accounting, progress toward completion is measured as the ratio of total costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion.  Costs are recognized as incurred.  Profit is determined based on estimated profit margin on the contract multiplied by the progress toward completion.  Revenue represents the sum of costs and profit on the contract for the period.    
                
    Under the units-of-delivery method of accounting, revenue on a contract is recorded as the units are delivered and accepted during the period at an amount equal to the contractual selling price of those units. The costs recorded on a contract under the units-of-delivery method of accounting are equal to the total costs at completion divided by the total units to be delivered.  As contracts can span multiple years, the Company often segments the contracts into production lots for the purposes of accumulating and allocating cost.  Profit is recognized as the difference between revenue for the units delivered and the estimated costs for the units delivered.

  (unaudited) 

Adjustments to original estimates for a contract s revenues, estimated costs at completion and estimated total profit are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained and as more information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change, or if contract modifications occur.  These estimates are also sensitive to the assumed rate of production.  Generally, the longer it takes to complete the contract quantity, the more relative overhead that contract will absorb.  The impact of revisions in cost estimates is recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period in which the revisions are made.  Provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are recorded in the period in which they become evident (  forward losses  ) and are first offset against costs that are included in inventory, with any remaining amount reflected in accrued contract liabilities in accordance with the   Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts   topic.  Revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect results of operations and cash flows, as well as valuation of inventory.  Furthermore, certain contracts are combined or segmented for revenue recognition in accordance with the   Revenue Recognition - Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts   topic. 
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company discovered an immaterial error in its percentage-of-completion accounting for one of its contracts, which understated cost of sales and net income for the three months ended June 30, 2016, in the amount of   $11,800   and   $8,142  , respectively and overstated retained earnings as of March 31, 2016, in the amount of   $12,700  .  The Company assessed the materiality of this error on previously issued financial statements in accordance with the ASC 250,   Presentation of Financial Statements  , and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality.  The Company concluded, based on a review of the quantitative and qualitative factors of the materiality of the amount, that the error was not material to any previously issued financial statements and the correction of the error in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was not material to that period s financial statements.  Accordingly, in order to correct this immaterial error, the Company has recorded a charge to "Cost of sales" in the amount of   $24,500  , which is presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , cumulative catch-up adjustments from changes in estimates, inclusive of changes in forward loss estimates and the correction of the error noted above, were balanced between positive and negative variances.  The cumulative catch-up adjustments to operating income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , included gross favorable adjustments of approximately   $49,936   and gross unfavorable adjustments of approximately   $(49,930)  , which includes the recapture of previously recognized forward losses on the 747-8 program of   $36,800  .  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , cumulative catch-up adjustments from changes in estimates   decreased   operating income, net income and earnings per share by approximately   $(6,794)  ,   $(4,433)   and   $(0.09)  , net of tax, respectively.  
  For the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , cumulative catch-up adjustments from changes in estimates, inclusive of changes in forward loss estimates and the correction of the error noted above,   decreased   operating income, net income and earnings per share by approximately   $(20,716)  ,   $(13,917)   and   $(0.28)  , net of tax, respectively.  The cumulative catch-up adjustments to operating income for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , included gross favorable adjustments of approximately   $46,111   and gross unfavorable adjustments of approximately   $(66,827)  , which includes the recapture of previously recognized forward losses on the 747-8 program of   $36,800  .  For the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , cumulative catch-up adjustments from changes in estimates   decreased   operating income, net income and earnings per share by approximately   $(6,324)  ,   $(4,270)   and   $(0.09)  , net of tax, respectively.  
    
  Amounts representing contract change orders or claims are only included in revenue when such change orders or claims have been settled with the customer and to the extent that units have been delivered.  Additionally, some contracts may contain provisions for revenue sharing, price re-determination, requests for equitable adjustments, change orders or cost and/or performance incentives. Such amounts or incentives are included in contract value when the amounts can be reliably estimated and their realization is reasonably assured.  
    
  Although fixed-price contracts, which extend several years into the future, generally permit the Company to keep unexpected profits if costs are less than projected, the Company also bears the risk that increased or unexpected costs may reduce profit or cause the Company to sustain losses on the contract. In a fixed-price contract, the Company must fully absorb cost overruns, notwithstanding the difficulty of estimating all of the costs the Company will incur in performing these contracts and in projecting the ultimate level of revenue that may otherwise be achieved.   
  As disclosed during fiscal 2016, the Company recognized a provision for forward losses associated with our long-term contract on the 747-8 and  Bombardier programs.  There is still risk similar to what the Company has experienced on the 747-8 and Bombardier programs. Particularly, the Company's ability to manage risks related to supplier performance, execution of

  (unaudited) 

cost reduction strategies, hiring and retaining skilled production and management personnel, quality and manufacturing execution, program schedule delays, potential need to negotiate facility lease extensions or alternatively relocate work and many other risks, will determine the ultimate performance of these programs. 
  Included in net sales of the Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures and Precision Components is the non-cash amortization of acquired contract liabilities that were recognized as fair value adjustments through purchase accounting from various acquisitions.   For the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company recognized   $30,477   and   $30,404  , respectively, into net sales on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.  For the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , the Company recognized   $59,825   and   $65,502  , respectively, into net sales on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  The Product Support provides repair and overhaul services, of which a small portion of services are provided under long-term power-by-the-hour contracts. The Company applies the proportional performance method of accounting to recognize revenue under these contracts.  Revenue is recognized over the contract period as units are delivered based on the relative value in proportion to the total estimated contract consideration.  In estimating the total contract consideration, management evaluates the projected utilization of its customers  fleet over the term of the contract, in connection with the related estimated repair and overhaul servicing requirements to the fleet based on such utilization.  Changes in utilization of the fleet by customers, among other factors, may have an impact on these estimates and require adjustments to estimates of revenue to be realized. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  The Company s trade accounts receivable are exposed to credit risk.  However, the risk is limited due to the diversity of the customer base and the customer base s wide geographical area.  Trade accounts receivable from Boeing (representing commercial, military and space) represented approximately   16%   and   18%   of total trade accounts receivable as of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , respectively. The Company had no other concentrations of credit risk of more than   10%  .   
  Sales to Boeing for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were   $657,901  , or   37%   of net sales, of which   $106,838  ,   $311,658  ,   $223,256   and   $16,149   were from the Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures, Precision Components and Product Support, respectively.  Sales to Boeing for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , were   $750,044  , or   39%   of net sales, of which   $97,379  ,   $460,664  ,   $173,825   and   $18,176   were from the Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures, Precision Components and Product Support, respectively.   
  Sales to Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were   $216,651  , or   12%   of net sales, of which   $1,083  ,   $209,684  ,   $5,782   and   $102   were from the Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures, Precision Components and Product Support, respectively.  Sales to Gulfstream for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , were   $251,384  , or   13%   of net sales, of which   $1,776  ,   $246,147  ,   $3,454   and   $7   were from the Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures, Precision Components and Product Support, respectively. 
  No other single customer accounted for more than   10%   of the Company s net sales.  However, the loss of any significant customer, including Boeing and Gulfstream, could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its operating subsidiaries. 
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based awards based on the fair value of those awards at the date of grant.   Stock-based compensation expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , was   $2,024   and   $1,199  , respectively.  Stock-based compensation expense for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , was   $3,976   and   $1,990  , respectively.  The Company has classified share-based compensation within selling, general and administrative expenses to correspond with the same line item as the majority of the cash compensation paid to employees.  Upon the exercise of stock options or vesting of restricted stock, the Company first transfers treasury stock, then issues new shares.

Intangible Assets 
  The components of intangible assets, net, are as follows:   

During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company performed interim and annual assessments of the fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets.  The Company concluded the fair value of the Vought and Embee tradenames did not exceed their carrying value.  Accordingly, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016.  Additionally, the Company determined that the tradenames will be amortized over their estimated remaining useful life of 20 years. 
  Amortization expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , was   $13,586   and   $14,447  , respectively.  Amortization expense for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , was   $27,217   and   $30,411  , respectively.  
  Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date.  When determining fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and also considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability.  The fair value hierarchy has three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  The Company has applied fair value measurements to its interest rate swap (see Note 6). 
  Warranty Reserves 
  A reserve has been established to provide for the estimated future cost of warranties on our delivered products.  The Company periodically reviews the reserves and adjustments are made accordingly.  A provision for warranty on products delivered is made on the basis of historical experience and identified warranty issues.  Warranties cover such factors as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and workmanship.  The majority of the Company's agreements include a   three  -year warranty, although certain programs have warranties up to   20   years.  The warranty reserves as of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , were   $109,066   and   $112,937  , respectively.

  (unaudited) 

The Company paid   $2,169   and   $2,220   for income taxes, net of refunds, for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively.   
  The Company made interest payments of   $34,514   and   $30,236   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 
  During the   six months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company financed   $11,427   of property and equipment additions through capital leases.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company remains able to purchase an additional   2,277,789   shares under the existing stock repurchase program.  However, there are certain restrictions placed on the repurchase program by the Company's lenders that prevent any repurchases at this time. 

3.      ACQUISITIONS  
  Acquisition of Fairchild Controls Corporation 
  Effective October 21, 2015, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Fairchild Controls Corporation ("Fairchild").  Fairchild is a leading provider of proprietary thermal management systems, auxiliary power generation systems, and related aftermarket spares and repairs.  The acquired business operates as Triumph Thermal Systems-Maryland, Inc. and its results are included in Integrated Systems from the date of acquisition. 
  The purchase price for Fairchild was   $57,130  , including a working capital adjustment paid in January 2016. Goodwill in the amount of   $14,695   was recognized for this acquisition and is calculated as the excess of consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized such as assembled workforce.  The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.  The Company has also identified an intangible asset related to customer relationships valued at   $18,000   with a weighted-average life of   12.0   years. 
  The following condensed balance sheet represents the amounts assigned to each major asset and liability caption in the aggregate from the acquisition of Fairchild, in accordance with ASC 805,   Business Combinations  : 

The Company finalized its estimates after it was able to determine that it had obtained all necessary information that existed as of the acquisition date related to these matters.

  (unaudited) 

The Fairchild acquisition has been accounted for under the acquisition method and, accordingly, is included in the condensed consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition.  The Company incurred   $569   in acquisition-related costs in connection with the Fairchild acquisition. 

4.      DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE 
  In September 2016, the Company sold all of the shares of Triumph Aerospace Systems-Newport News, Inc. ("TAS-Newport News) for total cash proceeds of   $9,000  .  As a result of the sale of TAS-Newport News, the Company recognized a loss of   $4,774   which is presented on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income as "Loss on divestiture."  The operating results of TAS-Newport News were included in Integrated Systems through the date of disposal. 
  The disposal of this entity does not represent a strategic shift and does not have a major effect on the Company's operations or financial results, as defined by ASC 205-20,   Discontinued Operations  ; as a result, the disposal does not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. 

5.    INVENTORIES 
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average-cost or specific-identification methods) or market. The components of inventories are as follows: 

Work-in-process inventory includes capitalized pre-production costs on newer development programs.  Capitalized pre-production costs include nonrecurring engineering, planning and design, including applicable overhead, incurred before production is manufactured on a regular basis.  Significant customer-directed work changes can also cause pre-production costs to be incurred.  These costs are typically recovered over a contractually determined number of ship set deliveries.  The balance of development program inventory, comprised principally of capitalized pre-production costs, excluding progress payments related to the Company's contracts with Bombardier for the Global 7000/8000 program ("Bombardier") and Embraer for the second generation E-Jet ("Embraer") are as follows:

During the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016  , the Company recorded a   $399,758   forward loss charge for the Bombardier Global 7000/8000 wing program.  Under our contract for this program, the Company has the right to design, develop and manufacture wing components over the initial   300   ship sets.  The Global 7000/8000 contract provides for fixed pricing and requires the Company to fund certain up-front development expenses, with certain milestone payments made by Bombardier.   
  The Global 7000/8000 program charge resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized pre-production costs due to the combination of cost recovery uncertainty, higher than anticipated non-recurring costs and increased forecasted costs on recurring production.  The increases in costs were driven by several factors, including: changing technical requirements, increased spending on the design and engineering phase of the program, and uncertainty regarding cost reduction and cost recovery initiatives with our customer and suppliers.   
  The program has continued to incur costs since March 2016 in support of the development and transition to production and the Company is in commercial discussions with Bombardier regarding recovery of those costs. 
  Further cost increases, or an inability to meet revised recurring cost forecasts, or an inability to reach a favorable resolution of cost recovery on the Global 7000/8000 program will likely result in additional forward loss reserves in future periods, while improvements in future costs compared to current estimates or additional cost recovery may result in favorable adjustments if forward loss reserves are no longer required. 
  The Company is still in the pre-production stages for the Bombardier and Embraer programs, as these aircrafts are not scheduled to enter service until 2018, or later.  Transition of these programs from development to recurring production levels is dependent upon the success of the programs at achieving flight testing and certification, as well as the ability of the Bombardier and Embraer programs to generate acceptable levels of aircraft sales.  The failure to achieve these milestones and level of sales or significant cost overruns may result in additional forward losses.

6.    LONG-TERM DEBT  
  Long-term debt consists of the following: 

Revolving Credit Facility  
  In May 2016, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among the Company, the Subsidiary Co-Borrowers, the lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent (the  Sixth Amendment  and the Credit Facility, as amended by the Sixth Amendment, the  Credit Facility ), pursuant to which those lenders electing to enter into the Sixth Amendment extended the expiration date for the revolving line of credit and the maturity date for the term loan by five years to May 3, 2021.  Lenders holding revolving credit commitments aggregating   $940,000   elected to extend the expiration date for the revolving line of credit, and Lenders holding approximately   $324,500   of term loans (out of an aggregate outstanding term loan balance of approximately   $330,000  ) elected to extend the term loan maturity date.  In connection with the amendment to the Credit Facility, the Company incurred   $5,126   of financing costs.  These costs, along with the   $4,626   of unamortized financing costs prior to the amendment, are being amortized over the remaining term of the Credit Facility. 
  In addition, the Sixth Amendment amended the Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) modify certain financial covenants to allow for the add-back of certain cash and non-cash charges, (ii) amend the total leverage ratio financial covenant to provide for a gradual reduction in the maximum permitted total leverage ratio commencing with the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, (iii) increase the interest rate, commitment fee and letter of credit fee pricing provisions for the highest pricing tier, (iv) establish the interest rate, commitment fee and letter of credit fee pricing at the highest pricing tier until the Company delivers its compliance certificate for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, (v) increase the minimum revolver availability threshold test in connection with the Company making certain permitted investments, certain additional permitted dividends, permitted acquisitions and permitted payments of certain types of indebtedness, and (vi) decrease the maximum senior secured leverage ratio threshold test  in connection with the Company making certain permitted investments, certain permitted dividends, permitted acquisitions and permitted payments of certain types of indebtedness during the period from the date of the Sixth Amendment until the Company delivers its compliance certificate for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.  
  In May 2014, the Company amended the Credit Facility with its lenders to (i) increase the maximum amount allowed for the receivable securitization facility (the  Securitization Facility ) and (ii) amend certain other terms and covenants. 
  In November 2013, the Company amended and restated its existing Credit Facility with its lenders to: (i) provide for a   $375,000   Term Loan with a maturity date of May 14, 2019 (the "2013 Term Loan");  (ii) maintain a Revolving Line of Credit under the Credit Facility of   $1,000,000   with a   $250,000   accordion feature; (iii) extend the maturity date to November 19, 2018; and (iv) amend certain other terms and covenants.

The Company will repay the outstanding principal amount of the 2013 Term Loan in quarterly installments, on the first business day of each January, April, July and October, commencing April 2014. 
  The obligations under the Credit Facility and related documents are secured by liens on substantially all assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries pursuant to a Second Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated as of November 19, 2013, among the administrative agent, the Company and the subsidiaries of the Company party thereto.   
  Pursuant to the Credit Facility, the Company can borrow, repay and re-borrow revolving credit loans, and cause to be issued letters of credit, in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed   $1,000,000   outstanding at any time.  The Credit Facility bears interest at either: (i)   LIBOR   plus between   1.38%   and   2.50%  ; (ii) the prime rate; or (iii) an overnight rate at the option of the Company.  The applicable interest rate is based upon the Company s ratio of total indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. In addition, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of between   0.25%   and    0.45%   on the unused portion of the Credit Facility.  The Company s obligations under the Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company s domestic subsidiaries. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $392,396   in borrowings and   $27,926   in letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit provisions of the Credit Facility, primarily to support insurance policies.  At   March 31, 2016  , there were   $140,000   in borrowings and   $25,709   in letters of credit outstanding under the Revolving Line of Credit provisions of the Credit Facility, primarily to support insurance policies.  The level of unused borrowing capacity under the Revolving Line of Credit provisions of the Credit Facility varies from time to time depending in part upon its compliance with financial and other covenants set forth in the related agreement.  The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on specified levels of indebtedness to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and interest coverage requirements, and includes limitations on, among other things, liens, mergers, consolidations, sales of assets, and incurrence of debt. If an event of default were to occur under the Credit Facility, the lenders would be entitled to declare all amounts borrowed under it immediately due and payable. The occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility could also cause the acceleration of obligations under certain other agreements. The Company is currently in compliance with all such covenants.  Although the Company does not anticipate any violations of the financial covenants, its ability to comply with these covenants is dependent upon achieving earnings and cash flow projections.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had borrowing capacity under this facility of   $298,967   after reductions for borrowings, letters of credit outstanding under the facility and consideration of covenant limitations. 
  In connection with the Company amending and restating the Credit Facility to add the 2013 Term Loan, the Company also entered into an interest rate swap agreement through November 2018 to reduce its exposure to interest on the variable rate portion of its long-term debt.  On the date of inception, the Company designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge in accordance with FASB guidance on accounting for derivatives and hedges and linked the interest rate swap to the 2013 Term Loan.  The Company formally documented the hedging relationship between 2013 Term Loan and the interest rate swap, as well as its risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, how the hedging instrument's effectiveness will be assessed and a description of the method of measuring the ineffectiveness.  The Company also formally assesses, both at the hedge's inception and on a quarterly basis, whether the derivative item is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , the interest rate swap agreement had a notional amount of   $323,438   and   $337,500  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , the interest rate swap agreement had a fair value of   $3,398   and   $4,526  , respectively, which is recorded in other noncurrent liabilities with an offset to other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes (Level 2).  The interest rate swap settles on a monthly basis when interest payments are made.  These settlements occur through the maturity date. 
  In October 2016, the Company entered into a Seventh Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement , among the Company, the Subsidiary Co-Borrowers, the lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent (the  Seventh Amendment  and the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended by the Seventh Amendment, the  Credit Agreement ).   Specifically, the Existing Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) modify certain financial covenants to allow for the add-back of certain cash and non-cash charges, (ii) increase the maximum permitted total leverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratio financial covenants commencing with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017, (iii) permit the sale of certain specified assets so long as the Company applies 65% of the net proceeds received from such sales to the outstanding term loan, pro rata across all maturities, (iv) establish a new higher pricing

tier for the interest rate, commitment fee and letter of credit fee pricing provisions, (v) increase the interest rate and letter of credit fee pricing provisions for several of the lower tiers of the pricing grid, (vi) establish the interest rate, commitment fee and letter of credit fee pricing at the highest pricing tier until the Company delivers its compliance certificate for its fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017, and (vii) extend the period during which the increased minimum revolver availability threshold test and the decreased maximum senior secured leverage ratio threshold test are in effect in connection with the Company making certain permitted investments, certain additional permitted dividends, permitted acquisitions and permitted payments of certain types of indebtedness to the date the Company delivers its compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017.  
  Receivables Securitization Facility 
  In November 2014, the Company amended its Securitization Facility, increasing the purchase limit from   $175,000   to   $225,000   and extending the term through November 2017.  In connection with the Securitization Facility, the Company sells on a revolving basis certain trade accounts receivable to Triumph Receivables, LLC, a wholly-owned special-purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions.  The Company is the servicer of the trade accounts receivable under the Securitization Facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the maximum amount available under the Securitization Facility was   $225,000  .  Interest rates are based on LIBOR plus a program fee and a commitment fee.   The program fee is   0.40%   on the amount outstanding under the Securitization Facility.  Additionally, the commitment fee is   0.40%   on   100.00%   of the maximum amount available under the Securitization Facility.  At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $151,600   outstanding under the Securitization Facility.  In connection with amending the Securitization Facility, the Company incurred approximately   $252   of financing costs.  These costs, along with the   $341   of unamortized financing costs prior to the amendment, are being amortized over the life of the Securitization Facility.  The Company secures its trade accounts receivable, which are generally non-interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings pursuant to the   Transfers and Servicing   topic of the ASC 860. 
  The agreement governing the Securitization Facility contains restrictions and covenants, including limitations on the making of certain restricted payments, creation of certain liens, and certain corporate acts such as mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets. 
  Capital Leases 
  During the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company financed   $11,427   of property and equipment additions through capital leases.  During the   six   months ended September 30, 2015, the Company obtained financing for existing fixed assets in the amount of   $6,497  . 
  Senior Notes Due 2021 
  On February 26, 2013, the Company issued   $375,000   principal amount of   4.875%   Senior Notes due 2021 (the "2021 Notes").  The 2021 Notes were sold at   100%   of principal amount and have an effective interest yield of   4.875%  .  Interest on the 2021 Notes accrues at the rate of    4.875%   per annum and is payable semiannually in cash in arrears on   April 1   and   October 1   of each year, commencing on October 1, 2013.  In connection with the issuance of the 2021 Notes, the Company incurred approximately   $6,327   of costs, which are a direct deduction to the face amount of the note and are being amortized on the effective interest method over the term of the 2021 Notes. 
  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, to ensure that the Company had full access to our Revolving Credit Facility (the "Credit Facility") during fiscal 2017, the Company obtained approval from the holders of the 2021 Notes to amend the terms of the indenture to conform with the 2022 Notes (as defined below) which allows for a higher level of secured debt.  Absent this consent, the Company would have been restricted as to the level of new borrowings under the Credit Facility during fiscal 2017.  As part of obtaining the consent, the Company paid the holders of the 2021 Notes   $5,466  , which is being amortized on the effective interest method over the remaining term of the 2021 Notes. 
  Further, to mitigate the risk of failing to obtain the consent and to ensure the Company had adequate liquidity through fiscal 2017, the Company chose to make a significant draw on the Credit Facility in early April 2016, taking the outstanding balance to approximately   $800,000  . The Company paid down substantially all of the draw to the Credit Facility upon receiving consent from the holders of the 2021 Notes in May 2016.

Agreement was   $90,000  .  Interest rates are based on LIBOR plus   0.65%   -   0.70%  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , the Company sold   $64,345   and   $89,900  , respectively, worth of eligible accounts receivable. 
  Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value 
  The carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, approximate fair value because of their short maturities (Level 1 inputs).  Carrying amounts and the related estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments not recorded at fair value in the financial statements are as follows: 

The fair value of the long-term debt was calculated based on interest rates available for debt with terms and maturities similar to the Company s existing debt arrangements, unless quoted market prices were available (Level 2 inputs). 
   
  7.    EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  The following is a reconciliation between the weighted-average outstanding shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:   

8.    INCOME TAXES 
  The Company follows the   Income Taxes   topic of the ASC 740, which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute criteria for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, as well as guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. 
    
  The Company has classified uncertain tax positions as noncurrent income tax liabilities unless expected to be paid in one year.  Penalties and tax-related interest expense are reported as a component of income tax expense.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , the total amount of accrued income tax-related interest and penalties was   $260   and   $239  , respectively.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was   $9,226   and   $9,212  , respectively, of which   $9,226   and   $9,212  , respectively, would impact the effective rate, if recognized.  The Company does not anticipate that total unrecognized tax benefits will be reduced in the next 12 months. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is in a three year cumulative book loss position and has recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets given this evidence and the insufficient positive evidence to support the realization of the Company s deferred tax assets.  The Company intends to continue maintaining a valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.  A reduction in the valuation allowance could result in a significant decrease in income tax expense in the period that the release is recorded.  However, the exact timing and amount of the reduction in its valuation allowance is

unknown at this time and will be subject to the earnings level the Company achieves during fiscal 2017 as well as the Company's projected income in future periods. 
  The effective income tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   33.8%   as compared to   34.7%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the income tax provision reflected the disallowed tax benefit of   $1,466   related to the capital loss generated from the divestiture of TAS-Newport News.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the income tax provision included the benefit of   $421   related to the effects of transfer pricing adjustments carried back to prior periods. 
  The effective income tax rate for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , was   32.8%   as compared to   32.5%   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  For the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the income tax provision reflected the disallowed tax benefit of   $1,466   related to the capital loss generated from the divestiture of TAS-Newport News.  For the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the income tax provision was reduced to reflect the benefit of   $4,213   from the decrease to the state deferred tax rates and the benefit of   $421   related to the effects of transfer pricing adjustments carried back to prior periods. 
  With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for fiscal years ended before March 31, 2011, state or local examinations for fiscal years ended before March 31, 2011, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for fiscal years ended before March 31, 2009.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is subject to examination in   one   state jurisdiction.  The Company has filed appeals in a prior state examination related to fiscal years ended March 31, 1999 through March 31, 2005. Because of net operating losses acquired as part of the acquisition of Vought, the Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations and various state jurisdictions for the years ended December 31, 2001, and after related to previously filed Vought tax returns.  The Company believes appropriate provisions for all outstanding issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years. 

9.    GOODWILL 
  The following is a summary of the changes in the carrying value of goodwill by reportable segment, from   March 31, 2016   through   September 30, 2016  : 

10.     PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS 
  The Company sponsors several defined benefit pension plans covering some of its employees.  Certain employee groups are ineligible to participate in the plans or have ceased to accrue additional benefits under the plans based upon their service to the Company or years of service accrued under the defined benefit pension plans.  Benefits under the defined benefit plans are based on years of service and, for most non-represented employees, on average compensation for certain years. It is the Company s policy to fund at least the minimum amount required for all qualified plans, using actuarial cost methods and assumptions acceptable under U.S. Government regulations, by making payments into a separate trust.  
  In addition to the defined benefit pension plans, the Company provides certain healthcare and life insurance benefits for eligible retired employees.  Such benefits are unfunded. Employees achieve eligibility to participate in these contributory plans upon retirement from active service if they meet specified age and years of service requirements. Election to participate for some employees must be made at the date of retirement. Qualifying dependents at the date of retirement are also eligible for medical coverage. Current plan documents reserve the right to amend or terminate the plans at any time, subject to applicable

  (unaudited) 

collective bargaining requirements for represented employees. From time to time, changes have been made to the benefits provided to various groups of plan participants. Premiums charged to most retirees for medical coverage prior to age 65 are based on years of service and are adjusted annually for changes in the cost of the plans as determined by an independent actuary. In addition to this medical inflation cost-sharing feature, the plans also have provisions for deductibles, co-payments, coinsurance percentages, out-of-pocket limits, schedules of reasonable fees, preferred provider networks, coordination of benefits with other plans and a Medicare carve-out.  
  In accordance with the   Compensation   Retirement Benefits   topic of ASC 715, the Company has recognized the funded status of the benefit obligation as of the date of the last remeasurement, on the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and the pension benefit obligation or accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, of the plan.  In order to recognize the funded status, the Company determined the fair value of the plan assets.  The majority of the plan assets are publicly traded investments which were valued based on the market price as of the date of remeasurement.  Investments that are not publicly traded were valued based on the estimated fair value of those investments based on our evaluation of data from fund managers and comparable market data. 
  Net Periodic Benefit Plan Costs    
  The components of net periodic benefit costs (income) for our postretirement benefit plans are shown in the following table:  

The Company periodically experiences events or makes changes to its benefit plans that result in special charges.  Some require remeasurements.  The following summarizes the key events whose effects on net periodic benefit costs are included in the tables above: 
             
    In April 2015, the Company's largest union-represented group of employees ratified a new collective bargaining agreement.  The agreement includes an amendment to the retirement plan, for which actively employed participants will no longer continue to accrue a benefit after 30 years of service.   This change resulted in a curtailment charge of

Issuance of Restricted Stock Awards and Stock Options 
  Included in the employment agreement for the Company's new CEO were restricted stock awards totaling   179,134   shares.  The awards generally vest in full after four to seven years.  The fair value of the awards is determined by the product of the number of shares granted, the grant date market price of the Company's stock and adjusted for the market conditions necessary to achieve the awards.  Certain of these awards contain performance conditions, in addition to service conditions.  The fair value of the awards is expensed over a graded vesting period of the requisite service period of four to seven years. 
  In addition the employment agreement included   150,000   stock options with an exercise price of   $30.86  , a contractual term of   10   years and vesting over a   4  -year period. 

12.      SEGMENTS 
  Effective April 2016, the Company realigned into four reportable segments: the Integrated Systems, the Aerospace Structures, the Precision Components and the Product Support segments.  The Company s reportable segments are aligned with how the business is managed and views the markets that the Company serves.  The Chief Operating Decision Maker (the "CODM") evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon review of segment information.  The CODM utilizes earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA ) as a primary measure of segment profitability to evaluate performance of its segments and allocate resources.  
  Integrated Systems consists of the Company s operations that provides integrated solutions including design, development and support of proprietary components, subsystems and systems, as well as production of complex assemblies using external designs.  Capabilities include hydraulic, mechanical and electro-mechanical actuation, power and control; a complete suite of aerospace gearbox solutions including engine accessory gearboxes and helicopter transmissions; active and passive heat exchange technology; fuel pumps, fuel metering units and Full Authority Digital Electronic Control fuel systems; hydro-mechanical and electromechanical primary and secondary flight controls; and a broad spectrum of surface treatment options.

14.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in disputes, claims, lawsuits, and governmental and regulatory inquiries that it deems to be immaterial.  Some may involve claims or potential claims of substantial damages, fines or penalties.  While the Company cannot predict the outcome of any pending or future litigation or proceeding and no assurances can be given, the Company does not believe that any pending matter will have a material effect, individually or in the aggregate, on its financial position or results of operations.  

15.    RESTRUCTURING COSTS 
  Fiscal 2016 Restructuring 
  During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company committed to a restructuring of certain of its businesses as well as the consolidation of certain of its facilities ("2016 Restructuring Plan").  The Company expects to reduce its footprint by approximately   3.5 million   square feet and to reduce head count by   1,200   employees.  Over the next few fiscal years, the Company estimates that it will record aggregate pre-tax charges of   $150,000   to   $160,000   related to these programs, which represent employee termination benefits, contract termination costs, accelerated depreciation and facility closure and other exit costs, and will result in future cash outlays. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded charges of   $14,202   related to this program including, accelerated depreciation of   $3,740   and severance of   $1,046  .  For the   six months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded charges of   $24,344   related to this program including, accelerated depreciation of   $7,231   and severance of   $1,098  . 
  The following table provides a summary of the Company's current aggregate cost estimates by major type of expense associated with the 2016 Restructuring Plan, along with a reconciliation of associated liability: 

(1)   I  ncludes costs to transfer product lines among facilities and outplacement and employee relocation costs. 
  (2) Accelerated depreciation charges are recorded as part of Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
  (3)  Consists of other costs directly related to the plan, including project management, legal and regulatory costs.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  (The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained elsewhere herein.) 

OVERVIEW 
  We are a major supplier to the aerospace industry and have four operating segments: (i) Integrated Systems, whose companies  revenues are derived from integrated solutions including design, development and support of proprietary components, subsystems and systems, as well as production of complex assemblies using external designs; (ii) Aerospace Structures, whose companies supply commercial, business, regional and military manufacturers with large metallic and composite structures; (iii) Precision Components, whose companies produce close-tolerance parts primarily to customer designs and model-based definition, including a wide range of aluminum, hard metal and composite structure capabilities; and (iv) Product Support, whose companies provide full life cycle solutions for commercial, regional and military aircraft.  
  In September 2016, the Company sold all of the shares of Triumph Aerospace Systems-Newport News, Inc. ("TAS-Newport News) for total cash proceeds of   $9,000  .  As a result of the sale of TAS-Newport News, the Company recognized a loss of   $4,774  , which is included in Corporate.  The operating results of TAS-Newport News were included in Integrated Systems through the date of disposal.  
  Highlights for the   second   quarter of the fiscal year ending   March 31, 2017   included: 
                 
    Net income for the   second   quarter of fiscal   2017   was   $0.70   per diluted common share, as compared to   $1.25   per diluted share in the prior year period. 
                
    We   used     $131.2 million   of cash flow from operating activities for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to cash used in operations of   $178.5 million   in the comparable prior year period. 
     During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, the Company committed to a restructuring of certain of its businesses as well as the consolidation of certain of its facilities (the "2016 Restructuring Plan").  The Company expects to reduce its footprint by approximately   3.5 million   square feet and to reduce head count by   1,200   employees.  Over the next few fiscal years, the Company estimates that it will record aggregate pre-tax charges of   $150.0 million   to   $160.0 million   related to these programs, which represent employee termination benefits, contract termination costs, accelerated depreciation and facility closure and other exit costs, and will result in future cash outlays. For the six months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded charges of   $24.3 million   related to this program, including accelerated depreciation of   $0.0 million   and severance of   $1.1 million  . 
  We are currently performing work on several new programs, which are in various stages of development.  Several of the these programs are expected to enter flight testing during our fiscal 2018, including the Bombardier Global 7000/8000 ("Bombardier"), and Embraer second generation E-Jet  ("E2-Jets") and we expect to deliver revenue generating production units for these programs in late fiscal 2017 or early fiscal 2018. Historically, low-rate production commences during flight testing, followed by an increase to full-rate production, assuming that successful testing and certification are achieved. Accordingly, we anticipate that each of these programs will begin generating full-rate production level revenues between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2021.  We are still in the early development stages for the Gulfstream G500/G600 programs, as these aircraft are not expected to enter service until fiscal 2019. Transition of each of these programs from development to recurring

  (continued) 

production levels is dependent upon the success of each program at achieving flight testing and certification, as well as the ability of the OEM to generate acceptable levels of aircraft sales. 
  During the   six months ended September 30, 2016  , we incurred approximately   $117.0 million   in capitalized pre-production costs associated with the Bombardier Global 7000/8000 and the Embraer second generation E-Jet programs, for which we have not yet begun deliveries.  We expect to incur additional costs related to these programs as they continue to develop.  Inventory costs are evaluated for recoverability through their inclusion in the total costs used in the calculation of each contract's estimated profit margin. When the estimated total contract costs exceed total estimated contract revenues, an inventory reserve is established.  We may incur additional costs related to these programs if there are further delays due to our customer or our capability to execute timely. 
  Fiscal 2016 was a challenging year for certain of our new programs.  While work progressed on these development programs, we experienced difficulties in achieving estimated cost targets particularly in the areas of engineering and estimated recurring costs.  We recorded a $399.8 million forward loss on our Bombardier wing contract in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2016.  The Bombardier contract provides for fixed pricing and requires us to fund certain up-front development expenses, with certain milestone payments made by Bombardier.   
  The Bombardier program charge resulted in the impairment of previously capitalized pre-production costs due to the combination of cost recovery uncertainty, higher than anticipated non-recurring costs and increased forecasted costs on recurring production.  The increases in costs were driven by several factors, including: changing technical requirements, increased spending on the design and engineering phase of the program and uncertainty regarding cost reduction and cost recovery initiatives with our customer and suppliers.   
  The program has continued to incur costs since March 2016 in support of development and transition to production and the Company is in commercial discussions with Bombardier regarding recovery of those costs.   
  Further cost increases or an inability to meet revised recurring cost forecasts, or an inability to reach a favorable resolution of cost recovery on the Bombardier program will likely result in additional forward loss reserves in future periods, while improvements in future costs compared to current estimates or additional cost recovery may result in favorable adjustments if forward loss reserves are no longer required. 
  Under our contract with Embraer, we have the exclusive right to design, develop and manufacture the center fuselage section III, rear fuselage section and various tail section components (rudder and elevator) for the E2-Jets over the initial 600 ship sets.  The contract provides for funding on a fixed amount of non-recurring costs, which will be paid over a specified number of production units.  Higher than expected spending on the E2-Jets program has resulted in a low single digit estimated profit margin percentage, with additional potential future cost pressures as well as opportunities for improved performance.  While we still estimate positive margins for this contract, risks related to additional engineering as well as the recurring cost profile remains as this program enters flight testing.  
  We seek additional consideration for customer work statement changes throughout the development process as a standard course of business.  The ability to recover or negotiate additional consideration is not certain and varies by contract.  Varying market conditions for these products may also impact future profitability.  
  Although none of these new programs individually are expected to have a material impact on our net revenues, they do have the potential, either individually or in the aggregate, to materially and negatively impact our consolidated results of operations if future changes in estimates result in the need for a forward loss provision.  Absent any such loss provisions, we do not anticipate that any of these new programs will significantly dilute our future consolidated margins.  
  In January 2016, Boeing announced a rate reduction to the 747-8 program, which lowers production to one plane every two months. We assessed the impact of the rate reduction and recorded an additional $161.4 million forward loss during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016. Subsequently, in July 2016, Boeing announced that it was reasonably possible that they could end production on the 747-8 program if the demand for the program did not improve.  If this were to occur, we could potentially claw-back a portion of the aforementioned forward loss.  Additional costs associated with exiting the facilities where the 747-8 program is manufactured, such as asset impairment, supplier and lease termination charges, as well as severance and retention payments to employees and contractors have been included in the 2016 Restructuring Plan. 
  
    34 

Table Of Contents  
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (continued) 

As previously disclosed, we recognized a provision for forward losses associated with our long-term contract on the 747-8 and Bombardier programs.  T  here is still risk similar to what we have experienced on the 747-8 and Bombardier programs.  Particularly, our ability to manage risks related to supplier performance, execution of cost reduction strategies, hiring and retaining skilled production and management personnel, quality and manufacturing execution, program schedule delays, potential need to negotiate facility lease extensions or alternatively relocate work and many other risks, will determine the ultimate performance of these long-term programs. 
  Recognition of additional forward losses in the future periods continues to be a risk and will depend upon several factors, including the impact of the above discussed production rate change, our ability to successfully perform under current design and manufacturing plans, achievement of forecasted cost reductions as we continue production and our ability to successfully resolve claims and assertions with our customers and suppliers. 
  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we settled the strike and agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement with our union employees with IAM District 751 at our Spokane, Washington facility which had expired during the quarter, resulting in a charge of $15.7 million.  Our union employees with UAW Local 848 at our Red Oak, Texas facility and UAW Local 952 at our Tulsa, Oklahoma facility are currently working without a contract.   If we are unable to negotiate a contract with each of those workforces, our operations may be disrupted and we may be prevented from completing production and delivery of products from those facilities, which would negatively impact our results.  Contingency plans have been developed that would allow production to continue in the event of an additional strike. 
  Effective October 21, 2015, the Company acquired the ownership of all of the outstanding shares of Fairchild Controls Corporation ("Fairchild").  Fairchild is a leading provider of proprietary thermal management systems, auxiliary power generation systems and related aftermarket spares and repairs.  The acquired business operates as Triumph Thermal Systems-Maryland, Inc. and its results are included in Integrated Systems from the date of acquisition. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  The following includes a discussion of our consolidated and business segment results of operations.  The Company's diverse structure and customer base do not allow for precise comparisons of the impact of price and volume changes to our results.  However, we have disclosed the significant variances between the respective periods. 
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We prepare and publicly release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with  U.S. GAAP.  In accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") guidance on Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations, we also disclose and discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures in our public releases.  Currently, the non-GAAP financial measure that we disclose is Adjusted EBITDA, which is our income from continuing operations before interest, income taxes, amortization of acquired contract liabilities, curtailments, settlements and early retirement incentives, legal settlements and depreciation and amortization.  We disclose Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated and a reportable segment basis in our earnings releases, investor conference calls and filings with the SEC.  The non-GAAP financial measures that we use may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.  Also, in the future, we may disclose different non-GAAP financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations. 
  We view Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure and, as such, we believe that the U.S. GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to it is income from continuing operations.  In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we exclude from income from continuing operations the financial items that we believe should be separately identified to provide additional analysis of the financial components of the day-to-day operation of our business.  We have outlined below the type and scope of these exclusions and the material limitations on the use of these non-GAAP financial measures as a result of these exclusions. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity, as an alternative to net income (loss), income from continuing operations, or as an indicator of any other measure of performance derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Investors and potential investors in our securities should not rely on Adjusted EBITDA as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measure, including net income (loss) or income from continuing operations.  In addition, we urge investors and potential investors in our securities to carefully review the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to income from continuing operations set forth below, in our earnings releases and in other filings with the SEC and to carefully review the U.S. GAAP financial information included as part of our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Annual Reports on Form 10-K that are filed with the SEC, as well as our quarterly earnings releases, and compare the GAAP financial information with our Adjusted EBITDA. 
  
    35 

Table Of Contents  
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (continued) 

Adjusted EBITDA is used by management to internally measure our operating and management performance and by investors as a supplemental financial measure to evaluate the performance of our business that, when viewed with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe provides additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business.  We have spent more than 20 years expanding our product and service capabilities, partially through acquisitions of complementary businesses.  Due to the expansion of our operations, which included acquisitions, our income from continuing operations has included significant charges for depreciation and amortization.  Adjusted EBITDA excludes these charges and provides meaningful information about the operating performance of our business, apart from charges for depreciation and amortization.  We believe the disclosure of Adjusted EBITDA helps investors meaningfully evaluate and compare our performance from quarter to quarter and from year to year.  We also believe Adjusted EBITDA is a measure of our ongoing operating performance because the isolation of non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, and non-operating items, such as interest and income taxes, provides additional information about our cost structure and, over time, helps track our operating progress.  In addition, investors, securities analysts and others have regularly relied on Adjusted EBITDA to provide a financial measure by which to compare our operating performance against that of other companies in our industry. 
  Set forth below are descriptions of the financial items that have been excluded from our income from continuing operations to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and the material limitations associated with using this non-GAAP financial measure as compared to income from continuing operations: 
             
    Divestitures may be useful for investors to consider because they reflect gains or losses from sale of operating units.  We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. 
                
    Legal settlements may be useful for investors to consider because it reflects gains or losses from disputes with third parties.  We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. 
                
    Curtailments, settlements and early retirement incentives may be useful for investors to consider because they represent the current period impact of the change in the defined benefit obligation due to the reduction in future service costs as well as the incremental cost of retirement incentive benefits paid to participants. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. 
                
    Amortization of acquired contract liabilities may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the non-cash earnings on the fair value of off-market contracts acquired through acquisitions. We do not believe these earnings necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash earnings related to our operations. 
                
    Amortization expense (including intangible asset impairments) may be useful for investors to consider because it represents the estimated attrition of our acquired customer base and the diminishing value of product rights and licenses. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure. 
                
    Depreciation may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the wear and tear on our property and equipment used in our operations. We do not believe these charges necessarily reflect the current and ongoing cash charges related to our operating cost structure. 
                
    The amount of interest expense and other we incur may be useful for investors to consider and may result in current cash inflows or outflows. However, we do not consider the amount of interest expense and other to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. 
                
    Income tax expense may be useful for investors to consider because it generally represents the taxes which may be payable for the period and the change in deferred income taxes during the period and may reduce the amount of funds otherwise available for use in our business.  However, we do not consider the amount of income tax expense to be a representative component of the day-to-day operating performance of our business. 
     Management compensates for the above-described limitations of using non-GAAP measures only to supplement our U.S. GAAP results and to provide additional information that is useful to gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business.

Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015 

Net sales   decreased   by   $(80.0) million  , or   (8.4)%  , to   $874.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $954.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The acquisition of Fairchild contributed $9.5 million in net sales. Organic sales decreased $89.5 million, or 9.4%, due to production rate reductions by our customers on the 747-8, Gulfstream G450/550 and C-17 programs.  Net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , included $3.6 million in total non-recurring revenues, as compared to $12.6 million in non-recurring revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Cost of sales   decreased     $(57.4) million  , or   (7.9)%  , to   $673.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $730.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The acquisition of Fairchild contributed $6.7 million to cost of sales.  Organic cost of sales decreased $64.1 million, or 8.1%, due to the decrease in organic sales mentioned above.  The comparable organic gross margin for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was 22.0%, as compared to 22.7%.

recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Gross margin for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments (  $6.8 million  ). 
    
  Segment operating income   decreased   by   $25.4 million  , or   (35.6)%  , to   $97.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $122.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The acquisition of Fairchild contributed $0.4 million to segment operating income.  Organic segment operating income decreased $25.8 million.  Organic operating income for the three months   September 30, 2016  , decreased due to the decrease in the gross margin as noted above and included costs related to the 2016 Restructuring Plan of   $2.7 million  . 
  Corporate expenses were   $26.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $12.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The increase in corporate expenses of   $14.2 million  , or   115.2%  , was impacted by the 2016 Restructuring Plan charges of   $7.7 million   and the loss on sale of assets of   $4.8 million  .  
    
  Interest expense and other   increased   by   $2.3 million  , or   14.5%  , to   $17.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $15.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to increased debt levels.  
  The effective income tax rate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   33.8%   compared to   34.7%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we are in a three year cumulative book loss position and have recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets given this evidence and the insufficient positive evidence to support the realization of our deferred tax assets.  We intend to continue maintaining a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.  A reduction in the valuation allowance could result in a significant decrease in income tax expense in the period that the release is recorded.  However, the exact timing and amount of the reduction in our valuation allowance are unknown at this time and will be subject to the earnings level we achieve during fiscal 2017 as well as our projected income in future periods.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the income tax provision reflected the disallowed tax benefit of   $1.5 million   related to the capital loss generated from the divestiture of TAS-Newport News.  For the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the income tax provision included the benefit related to the effects of transfer pricing adjustments (  $0.4 million  ). For the fiscal year ending   March 31, 2017  , the Company expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 18.0% with opportunity to be reduced further through the release of the valuation allowance that is discussed further in Note 8. 

Business Segment Performance - Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015    
  Effective April 1, 2016, we realigned the way we report our financial performance based on the following four reportable segments: the Integrated Systems, the Aerospace Structures, the Precision Components and the Product Support segments.  The results of operations among our operating segments vary due to differences in competitors, customers, extent of proprietary deliverables and performance.  For example, our Integrated Systems, which generally includes proprietary products and/or arrangements where we become the primary source or one of a few primary sources to our customers, where our unique manufacturing capabilities command a higher margin.  Also OEMs are increasingly focusing on assembly activities while outsourcing more manufacturing and repair to third parties, and as a result, are less of a competitive force than in previous years.  This compares to our Aerospace Structures, which generally includes long-term sole-source or preferred supplier contracts and the success of these programs provides a strong foundation for our business and positions us well for future growth on new programs and new derivatives.    In contrast, our Product Support provides MRO services on components and accessories manufactured by third parties, with more diverse competition, including airlines, OEMs and other third-party service providers.  In addition, variability in the timing and extent of customer requests performed in the Product Support can provide for greater volatility and less predictability in revenue and earnings than that experienced in the Integrated Systems, Aerospace Structures and Precision Components segments. 
  The Integrated Systems consists of the Company s operations that provides integrated solutions including design, development and support of proprietary components, subsystems and systems, as well as production of complex assemblies using external designs.  Capabilities include hydraulic, mechanical and electro-mechanical actuation, power and control; a complete suite of aerospace gearbox solutions including engine accessory gearboxes and helicopter transmissions; active and passive heat exchange technology; fuel pumps, fuel metering units and Full Authority Digital Electronic Control fuel systems; hydro-mechanical and electromechanical primary and secondary flight controls; and a broad spectrum of surface treatment options.

  The Product Support consists of the Company s operations that provides full life cycle solutions for commercial, regional and military aircraft.  The Company s extensive product and service offerings include full post-delivery value chain services that simplify the MRO supply chain.  Through its line maintenance, component MRO and postproduction supply chain activities, the Company s Product Support is positioned to provide integrated planeside repair solutions globally.  Capabilities include fuel tank repair, metallic and composite aircraft structures, nacelles, thrust reversers, interiors, auxiliary power units and a wide variety of pneumatic, hydraulic, fuel and mechanical accessories.  
  We currently generate a majority of our revenue from clients in the commercial aerospace industry, the military, the business jet industry and the regional airline industry.  Our growth and financial results are largely dependent on continued demand for our products and services from clients in these industries.  If any of these industries experiences a downturn, our clients in these sectors may conduct less business with us.  The following table summarizes our net sales by end market by business segment.  The loss of one or more of our major customers or an economic downturn in the commercial airline or the military and defense markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.

As of June 30, 2016, we are in a three year cumulative book loss position and have recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of our net deferred tax assets given this evidence and the insufficient positive evidence to support the realization of our deferred tax assets.  We intend to continue maintaining a valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient positive evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances.  A reduction in the valuation allowance could result in a significant decrease in income tax expense in the period that the release is recorded.  However, the exact timing and amount of the reduction in our valuation allowance are unknown at this time and will be subject to the earnings level we achieve during fiscal 2017 as well as our projected income in future periods.

The cost of sales were negatively impacted by the decreased sales as noted above and by a provision for forward losses of $34.3 million on the UAS, Gulfstream G450/550 and A350 programs, offset by the recapture of previously recognized forward losses on the 747-8 program of   $36.8 million  .  This amount includes the correction of an immaterial error in the amount of   $12.7 million   recorded during the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The comparable gross margin for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   was 13.2% compared with 16.4% for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Aerospace Structures cost of sales for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments (  $20.7 million  ).  The cumulative catch-up adjustments to gross margin for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   included gross favorable adjustments (  $46.1 million  ) and gross unfavorable adjustments (  $66.8 million  ).  The cumulative catch-up adjustments for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were mainly due to forward losses and correction of error mentioned above.  Segment cost of sales for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015   included net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments (  $6.3 million  ). 
  Aerospace Structures operating income   decreased   by   $44.4 million  , or   56.6%  , to   $34.0 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $78.5 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Operating income decreased for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to the decreased sales and forward losses included in cost of sales noted above.  Additionally, amortization increased ($3.8 million) due to the amortization of the Vought tradename.  The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA year over year is due to the same factors that decreased operating income. 
  Aerospace Structures operating income as a percentage of segment sales decreased to   5.2%   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   10.1%   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to the decrease in operating income as noted above.  These same factors contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA year over year. 
  Precision Components:   Precision Components net sales   decreased   by   $16.9 million  , or   3.2%  , to   $514.1 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $531.0 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The decline in sales was primarily driven by production rate reductions on Boeing Commercial and Gulfstream G450/550 and price reductions due to changes in model mix, partially offset by increased production rates on the A350 program. 
  Precision Components cost of sales increased by   $25.7 million  , or   6.1%  , to   $449.3 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $423.6 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The cost of sales increased due to the strike at our Spokane, Washington facility ($15.7 million), start-up costs related to the A350 and other new programs, also changes in sales mix.  Gross margin for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   was 12.6%, compared with 20.2% for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
  Precision Components operating income   decreased   by   $46.1 million  , or   91.5%  , to   $4.3 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $50.4 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Operating income   decreased   due to the decreased sales and the increased cost of sales as noted above.  These same factors contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA year over year. 
  Precision Components operating income as a percentage of segment sales decreased to   0.8%   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   9.5%   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to the sales and cost of sales factors as noted above. These same factors contributed to the decrease in Adjusted EBITDA margin year over year.

Product Support:   Product Support net sales   increased   by   $21.5 million  , or   14.5%  , to   $170.0 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $148.5 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Sales increased due to key wins in structures, interiors, and accessories. 
  Product Support cost of sales   increased   by   $14.3 million  , or   13.1%  , to   $123.5 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $109.3 million   for the   six   months ended    September 30, 2015  .  Cost of sales increased due to the increased sales noted above.  Gross margin for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   was 27.3% compared to 26.4% for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to the sale mix and greater efficiency driven by the higher volume.  
  Product Support operating income   increased   by   $9.2 million  , or   48.2%  , to   $28.3 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $19.1 million   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Operating income increased due to sales factors as noted above and the prior year period included an increase to the bad debt reserve resulting from an international customer's declaration of bankruptcy ($1.1 million).  These same factors contributed to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA year over year.  
  Product Support operating income as a percentage of segment sales increased to   16.7%   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   12.9%   for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to the increased sales noted above.  These same factors contributed to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin year over year. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our working capital needs are generally funded through cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit arrangements.  During the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we   used   approximately   $131.2 million   of cash flows from operating activities,   used   approximately   $13.9 million   in investing activities and   received   approximately   $161.5 million   in financing activities.  
  Cash flows used in operating activities for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $131.2 million  , compared to cash flows used in operating activities for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015   of   $178.5 million  .  During the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash used in operating activities was primarily due the timing of payments on accounts payable and other accrued expenses ($201.4 million) driven by pre-production costs, net spending on the Tulsa Programs discussed below and a $5.5 million payment related to a previously resolved legal settlement offset by increased receipts from customers and others related to the acceleration of cash receipts through the Receivables Purchase Agreement ($271.6 million), as defined below.  
  We continue to invest in inventory for new programs which impacts our cash flows from operating activities.  During the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , inventory build for capitalized pre-production costs on new programs excluding progress payments, including the Bombardier Global 7000/8000 program and the Embraer E-Jet, were   $96.6 million   and   $20.5 million  , respectively.  Net spending on the Tulsa Programs for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   was approximately $46.8 million.  Additionally, production inventory build, including build ahead on several programs subject to relocation, was approximately $9.1 million.  Unliquidated progress payments netted against inventory decreased $28.7 million, due to timing of receipts.  
  Cash flows used in investing activities for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     $28.6 million   from the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Cash flows used in investing activities for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016  , included capital expenditures (  $24.0 million  ).  The   six   months ended   September 30, 2015   included cash used in investing activities included a payment to settle a working capital adjustment related to the GE acquisition ($6.0 million) and capital expenditures (  $38.1 million  ). 
  Cash flows provided by financing activities for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $161.5 million  , compared to cash flows used in financing activities for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2015   of   $226.0 million  .   Cash flows provided by financing activities for the   six   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, included additional borrowings on our Credit Facility (as defined below) to fund operations.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $299.0 million   was available under our revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) after consideration of covenant limitations.  On   September 30, 2016  , an aggregate amount of approximately   $392.4 million   was outstanding under the Credit Facility, all of which was accruing interest at LIBOR plus applicable basis points totaling 2.0% per annum.  Amounts repaid under the Credit Facility may be reborrowed.

  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (continued) 

At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $151.6 million   outstanding under our receivable securitization facility ("Securitization Facility").  Interest rates on the Securitization Facility are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper, plus a program fee and a commitment fee. 
  On March 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Receivables Purchase Agreement") to sell certain accounts receivables to a financial institution without recourse.  The Company is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Purchase Agreement.  As of March 31, 2016, the maximum amount available under the Receivables Purchase Agreement was   $90.0 million  .  Interest rates are based on LIBOR plus   0.65%   -   0.70%  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , the Company sold   $64.3 million   and   $89.9 million  , respectively, worth of eligible accounts receivable. 
  In May 2016, the Company entered into a Sixth Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among the Company, the Subsidiary Co-Borrowers, the lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent (the  Sixth Amendment  and the Credit Facility, as amended by the Sixth Amendment, the  Credit Facility ), pursuant to which those lenders electing to enter into the Sixth Amendment extended the expiration date for the revolving line of credit and the maturity date for the term loan by five years to May 3, 2021.  Lenders holding revolving credit commitments aggregating $940.0 million elected to extend the expiration date for the revolving line of credit, and Lenders holding approximately $324.5 million of term loans (out of an aggregate outstanding term loan balance of approximately $330.0 million) elected to extend the term loan maturity date.   
  In addition, the Sixth Amendment amended the Credit Facility to, among other things, (i) modify certain financial covenants to allow for the add-back of certain cash and non-cash charges, (ii) amend the total leverage ratio financial covenant to provide for a gradual reduction in the maximum permitted total leverage ratio commencing with the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, (iii) increase the interest rate, commitment fee and letter of credit fee pricing provisions for the highest pricing tier, (iv) establish the interest rate, commitment fee and letter of credit fee pricing at the highest pricing tier until the Company delivers its compliance certificate for its fiscal year ending March 31, 2017, (v) increase the minimum revolver availability threshold test in connection with the Company making certain permitted investments, certain additional permitted dividends, permitted acquisitions and permitted payments of certain types of indebtedness, and (vi) decrease the maximum senior secured leverage ratio threshold test  in connection with the Company making certain permitted investments, certain permitted dividends, permitted acquisitions and permitted payments of certain types of indebtedness during the period from the date of the Sixth Amendment until the Company delivers its compliance certificate for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.  
  In October 2016, the Company entered into a Seventh Amendment to the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, among the Company, the Subsidiary Co-Borrowers, the lenders party thereto and the Administrative Agent (the  Seventh Amendment  and the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended by the Seventh Amendment, the  Credit Agreement ).   Specifically, the Existing Credit Agreement was amended to, among other things, (i) modify certain financial covenants to allow for the add-back of certain cash and non-cash charges, (ii) increase the maximum permitted total leverage ratio and senior secured leverage ratio financial covenants commencing with the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 through the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2017, (iii) permit the sale of certain specified assets so long as the Company applies 65% of the net proceeds received from such sales to the outstanding term loan, pro rata across all maturities, (iv) establish a new higher pricing tier for the interest rate, commitment fee and letter of credit fee pricing provisions, (v) increase the interest rate and letter of credit fee pricing provisions for several of the lower tiers of the pricing grid, (vi) establish the interest rate, commitment fee and letter of credit fee pricing at the highest pricing tier until the Company delivers its compliance certificate for its fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017, and (vii) extend the period during which the increased minimum revolver availability threshold test and the decreased maximum senior secured leverage ratio threshold test are in effect in connection with the Company making certain permitted investments, certain additional permitted dividends, permitted acquisitions and permitted payments of certain types of indebtedness to the date the Company delivers its compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017. 
  The Company is currently in compliance with all such covenants.  Although the Company does not anticipate any violations of the financial covenants, its ability to comply with these covenants is dependent upon achieving earnings and cash flow projections. 
  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, to ensure that the Company had full access to our the Credit Facility during fiscal 2017, the Company obtained approval from the holders of the 2021 Notes to amend the terms of the indenture to conform with the 2022 Notes (as defined below) which allows for a higher level of secured debt.  Absent this consent, the Company would have been restricted as to the level of new borrowings under the Credit Facility during fiscal 2017.

  Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
  Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (continued) 

The expected future cash flows for the next five years for long-term debt, leases and other obligations are as follows: 

(1) Included in the Company s balance sheet at   September 30, 2016  . 
  (2) Includes fixed-rate interest only. 
  The above table excludes unrecognized tax benefits of   $9.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , since we cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. 
  For the fiscal year ending   March 31, 2017  , the Company is not required to make minimum contributions to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans under the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Pension Protection Act of 2006.   
  We believe that cash generated by operations and borrowings under the Credit Facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash requirements for our current operations for the foreseeable future.  However, we are continuously evaluating various acquisition and divestiture opportunities, while opportunistically buying back shares to return capital to our shareholders.  As a result, we currently are pursuing the potential purchase of a number of candidates.  In the event that more than one of these transactions are successfully consummated, the availability under the Credit Facility might be fully utilized and additional funding sources may be needed.  There can be no assurance that such funding sources will be available to us on terms favorable to us, if at all. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The Company's critical accounting policies are discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and notes accompanying the condensed consolidated financial statements that appear in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016  . Except as otherwise disclosed in the financial statements and accompanying notes included in this report, there were no material changes subsequent to the filing of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016  , in the Company's critical accounting policies or in the assumptions or estimates used to prepare the financial information appearing in this report. 

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 relating to our future operations and prospects, including statements that are based on current projections and expectations about the markets in which we operate, and our beliefs concerning future performance and capital requirements based upon current available information.  Such statements are based on our beliefs as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to us.  When used in this document, words like  may,   might,   will,   expect,   anticipate,   believe,   potential,  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.  Actual results could differ materially from our current expectations.  For example, there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required or that additional capital, if required, will be available on reasonable terms, if at all, at such times and in such amounts as may be needed by us.  In addition to these factors, among other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are uncertainties relating to the integration of acquired businesses, general economic conditions affecting our business, dependence of certain of our businesses on certain key customers as well as competitive factors relating to the aviation industry.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
    
  (a) Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our  reports pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we completed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures.  Based on the foregoing, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  (b) Changes in internal control over financial reporting.     
  There were no changes that occurred during the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

    REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY 
     2.1  Revolving Credit Commitments. 
  2.8.1  General. 
  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Bank severally agrees to make Revolving Credit Loans in Dollars to the Borrowers at any time or from time to time on or after the date hereof to the Expiration Date provided that after giving effect to each such Loan the aggregate amount of Revolving Credit Loans from such Bank shall not exceed such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment minus such Bank's Ratable Share of the Dollar Equivalent amount of the then outstanding Swing Loans and the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding.  Within such limits of time and amount and subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may borrow, repay and reborrow pursuant to this Section 2.1. 
  
   42 

2.8.2  Right to Increase Commitments. 
  Provided that there is not continuing any Event of Default or Potential Default, if the Borrowers wish to increase the Revolving Credit Commitments and/or the Term Loan Commitments, TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof, provided that any such increase shall be a one-time increase and in the aggregate shall be in a minimum of $10,000,000 and a maximum of $350,000,000.  Each Bank shall have the right at any time within thirty (30) days following such notice to increase its respective Revolving Credit Commitment and/or Term Loan Commitment as the case may be, so as to provide such added commitment pro rata in accordance with such Bank's Ratable Share of the Revolving Credit Commitments and/or the Term Loan Commitments, as the case may be, and any portion of such requested increase which is not provided by any Bank shall be available to the other Banks, and thereafter, to the extent not provided by the Banks, to any additional bank (for purposes of this section, an "  Additional Bank  ") proposed by TGI, which is approved by the Administrative Agent (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and which becomes a party to this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.11.  In the event of any such increase in the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments and/or Term Loan Commitments, as the case may be, effected pursuant to the terms of this subsection 2.1.2, new Notes shall, to the extent necessary, be executed and delivered by the Borrowers in exchange for the surrender of the existing Notes.  If Revolving Credit Loans would be outstanding immediately after giving effect to any such increase, then simultaneously with such increase (i) each such Bank increasing its Revolving Credit Commitments (for purposes of this section, an "  Increasing Bank  "), each such Additional Bank and each other Bank shall be deemed to have entered into a master Assignment and Assumption Agreement, in form and substance substantially similar to Exhibit 1.1(A), pursuant to which each such other Bank shall have assigned to each such Increasing Bank and each such Additional Bank, a portion of its Revolving Credit Loans necessary to reflect proportionately the Revolving Credit Commitments as adjusted in accordance with this Section 2.1.2, and (ii) in connection with such assignment, each such Increasing Bank and each such Additional Bank shall pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of each such other Bank, such amount as shall be necessary to reflect the assignment to it of Revolving Credit Loans, and in connection with such master assignment each such other Bank may treat the assignment of Revolving Credit Loans subject to a Euro-Rate Option as a prepayment thereof for purposes of Section 5.5.2.  In the event that such transactions result in an increase of the Term Loans outstanding (a) such increase shall be funded at the closing of the transaction described in this section, and (b) as of such closing, the parties shall amend the repayment schedule set forth in Section 3.2, as agreed to by the Agent, the Borrowers and the Banks holding not less than 51% of the Term Loan Commitments after giving effect to such increase.   
  2.2  Nature of Banks' Obligations with Respect to Revolving Credit Loans. 
  Each Bank shall be obligated to participate in each request for Revolving Credit Loans pursuant to Section 2.4 in accordance with its Ratable Share.  The aggregate amount of each Bank's Revolving Credit Loans outstanding hereunder to the Borrowers at any time shall never exceed its Revolving Credit Commitment minus its Ratable Share of the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letter of Credit Outstandings and the Dollar Equivalent of outstanding Swing Loans, subject to Section 5.6.1.  The obligations of each Bank hereunder are several.  The failure of any  
  
   43 

Bank to perform its obligations hereunder shall not affect the Obligations of the Borrowers to any other party nor the several obligations of the other Banks to the Borrowers; nor shall any other party be liable for the failure of such Bank to perform its obligations hereunder.  The Banks shall have no obligation to make Revolving Credit Loans hereunder on or after the Expiration Date. 
  2.3  Commitment Fees. 
  Accruing from the Closing Date until the Expiration Date, the Borrowers agree to pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars for the account of each Bank according to its Ratable Share, as consideration for such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment hereunder, a nonrefundable commitment fee (the "  Commitment Fee  "), calculated on a per annum (365 or 366 days, as appropriate, and actual days elapsed) basis under the Pricing Grid, on the average daily difference between the amount of (i) the Revolving Credit Commitments as the same may be constituted from time to time and (ii) the Dollar Equivalent Revolving Facility Usage; provided, however, that the portion of the Commitment Fee accrued with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitment of a Defaulting Bank during the period prior to the time such Bank became a Defaulting Bank and unpaid at such time shall not be payable by the Borrowers so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank except to the extent that such Commitment Fee shall otherwise have been due and payable by the Borrowers prior to such time; and provided further that no Commitment Fee shall accrue on the Revolving Credit Commitment of a Defaulting Bank so long as such Bank is a Defaulting Bank.  All Commitment Fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the first Business Day of each October, January, April and July for the immediately preceding quarter and on the Expiration Date or upon acceleration of the Notes.  For purposes of this computation, PNC Bank's outstanding Swing Loans shall be deemed to be borrowed amounts under its Revolving Credit Commitment (and no other Bank's). 
  2.4  Revolving Credit Loan Requests. 
  Except as otherwise provided herein, TGI, on behalf of the Borrowers may from time to time prior to the Expiration Date request the Banks to make Revolving Credit Loans, or renew or convert the Interest Rate Option applicable to existing Revolving Credit Loans or Term Loans pursuant to Section 4.3, by delivering to the Administrative Agent, not later than (i) 2:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, three (3) Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date with respect to the making of Revolving Credit Loans to which the Euro-Rate Option applies or the date of conversion to or the renewal of the Euro-Rate Option for any such Loans; and (ii) 10:30 a.m., Pittsburgh time on either the proposed Borrowing Date with respect to the making of a Revolving Credit Loan to which the Base Rate Option applies or the last day of the preceding Interest Period with respect to the conversion to the Base Rate Option for any Loan to which the Euro-Rate Option applies, of a duly completed request therefor substantially in the form of   Exhibit 2.4   or a request by telephone immediately confirmed in writing by letter, or facsimile in such form (each, a "  Loan Request  "), it being understood that the Administrative Agent may rely on the authority of any individual making such a telephonic request without the necessity of receipt of such written confirmation.  Each Loan Request shall be irrevocable and shall specify (i) the proposed Borrowing Date; (ii) the aggregate amount of the proposed Loans comprising each Borrowing Tranche, the amount of which shall be in integral multiples of $500,000 and not less than $2,000,000 for each Borrowing Tranche to which the Euro-Rate Option applies and not less than the lesser of $200,000 or the maximum amount available for Borrowing Tranches to  
  
   44 

which the Base Rate Option applies; (iii) whether the Euro-Rate Option or Base Rate Option shall apply to the proposed Loans comprising the Borrowing Tranche; and (iv) in the case of a Borrowing Tranche to which the Euro-Rate Option applies, an appropriate Interest Period for the proposed Loans comprising such Borrowing Tranche.  If TGI (i) fails to specify an interest rate option to be applicable to a Borrowing Tranche of Loans, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested the Base Rate Option with respect to such Borrowing Tranche, or (ii) elects the Euro-Rate option but fails to specify an Interest Period to apply to the applicable Loans, such Interest Period shall be one (1) month. 
  2.5  Making Revolving Credit Loans. 
  The Administrative Agent shall, promptly after receipt by it of a Loan Request pursuant to Section 2.4, notify the Banks of its receipt of such Loan Request specifying: (i) the proposed Borrowing Date and the time and method of disbursement of such Revolving Credit Loans; (ii) the amount(s) and type(s) of each Revolving Credit Loan and the applicable Interest Period(s) (if any); and (iii) the apportionment among the Banks of the Revolving Credit Loans as determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with Section 2.2.  Each Bank shall remit the principal amount of each Revolving Credit Loan to the Administrative Agent such that the Administrative Agent shall, to the extent the Banks have made funds available to it for such purposes, fund such Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrowers in Dollars and in immediately available funds at the Principal Office prior to 2:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, on the Borrowing Date,   provided   that if any Bank fails to remit such funds to the Administrative Agent in a timely manner, the Administrative Agent may elect in its sole discretion to fund with its own funds the Revolving Credit Loans of such Bank on the Borrowing Date and such Bank shall be subject to the repayment obligation in Section 10.16. 
  2.6  Revolving Credit Notes. 
  The Obligation of the Borrowers to repay the aggregate unpaid principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans made by each Bank, together with interest thereon, shall be evidenced by a Revolving Credit Note dated the Closing Date payable to the order of such Bank in a face amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Bank. 
  2.7  Use of Proceeds. 
  The proceeds of the Loans shall be used for the purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness, redeeming the 2009 Bonds and for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions permitted hereunder. 
  2.8  Letter of Credit Subfacility. 
  2.8.1  Issuance of Letters of Credit. 
  TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, may request the issuance of a letter of credit (each a "  Letter of Credit  ") which may be denominated in either Dollars or an Optional Currency for itself or on behalf of another Loan Party or a non-Loan Party Subsidiary by delivering or having such other Loan Party deliver to the Issuing Bank (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) a completed application and agreement for letters of credit in such form as the Issuing  
  
   45 

Bank may specify from time to time by no later than 10:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, at least five (5) Business Days, or such shorter period as may be agreed to by the Issuing Bank, in advance of the proposed date of issuance.  Promptly after receipt of any letter of credit application, the Issuing Bank shall confirm with the Administrative Agent (by telephone or in writing) that the Administrative Agent has received a copy of such Letter of Credit application and if not, such Issuing Bank will provide Administrative Agent with a copy thereof.  All letters of credit which are identified on   Schedule 2.8.1   hereto shall be deemed to have been issued under this Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof and in reliance on the agreements of the other Banks set forth in this Section 2.8, the Administrative Agent will issue a Letter of Credit provided that each Letter of Credit shall (A) have a maximum maturity of twenty-four (24) months from the date of issuance, and (B) expire no later than one Business Day prior to the Expiration Date unless it is fully Cash Collateralized on or before the Expiration Date, in which event, such Letter of Credit shall expire no later than three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the Expiration Date, and provided that in no event shall (i) the Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding exceed, at any one time, $100,000,000 or (ii) the Dollar Equivalent Revolving Facility Usage exceed, at any one time, the Revolving Credit Commitments. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Letter of Credit may contain customary automatic renewal provisions agreed upon by TGI and the Issuing Bank pursuant to which the expiration date of such Letter of Credit shall automatically be extended for a period of up to 12 months (but not to a date later than the date set forth in clause (B) above), subject to a right on the part of the Issuing Bank to prevent any such renewal from occurring by giving notice to the beneficiary in advance of any such renewal; provided that (I) the initial expiration date (or any subsequent expiration date) of each such Letter of Credit is not later than one (1) Business Day prior to the Expiration Date, and (II) renewal of such Letter(s) of Credit, at the Issuing Bank's discretion, shall be available upon written request from TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, to the Issuing Bank at least thirty (30) days (or such other time period as agreed by TGI and the Issuing Bank) before the date upon which notice of nonrenewal is otherwise required. 
  Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend, extend or increase any Letter of Credit, if any Bank is at such time a Defaulting Bank hereunder, unless the Issuing Bank has entered into satisfactory arrangements with the Borrowers or such Bank to eliminate the Issuing Bank's risk with respect to such Bank (it being understood that the Issuing Bank would consider the Borrowers providing cash collateral to the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Issuing Bank, to secure the Defaulting Bank's Ratable Share of the Letter of Credit a satisfactory arrangement). 
  2.8.2  Letter of Credit Fees. 
  The Borrowers shall pay in Dollars (i) to the Administrative Agent for the ratable account of the Banks a fee (the "  Letter of Credit Fee  ") at the rate per annum set forth in the Pricing Grid (based on a year of 360 days, and actual days elapsed), and (ii) to the Issuing Bank for its own account a fronting fee equal to 1/8% per annum, which fees shall be computed on the daily average Dollar Equivalent amount of Letters of Credit Outstanding for the immediately preceding fiscal quarter (or shorter period commencing with the  Closing Date and or ending on the Expiration Date) and shall be payable quarterly in arrears commencing with the first Business Day of October, January, April and July following issuance of each Letter of Credit and on the  
  
   46 

Expiration Date.  The Borrowers shall also pay to the Issuing Bank in Dollars for the Issuing Bank's sole account the Issuing Bank's then in effect customary fees and administrative expenses payable with respect to the Letters of Credit as the Administrative Agent may generally charge or incur from time to time in connection with the issuance, maintenance, modification (if any), assignment or transfer (if any), negotiation, and administration of Letters of Credit. 
  2.8.3  Disbursements, Reimbursement. 
  2.8.4.1  Immediately upon the issuance of each Letter of Credit, each Bank shall be deemed to, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees to, purchase from the Issuing Bank a participation in such Letter of Credit and each drawing thereunder in an amount equal to such Bank's Ratable Share of the maximum amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit and the amount of such drawing, respectively. 
  2.8.4.2  In the event of any request for a drawing under a Letter of Credit by the beneficiary or transferee thereof, the Issuing Bank will promptly notify TGI, as agent for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent.  Provided that it shall have received such notice, the Borrowers shall reimburse (such obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall sometimes be referred to as a "  Reimbursement Obligation  ") the Issuing Bank in Dollars prior to 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time on each date that an amount is paid by the Issuing Bank under any Letter of Credit (each such date, a "  Drawing Date  ") in an amount equal to the Dollar Equivalent amount so paid by the Issuing Bank.  In the event the Borrowers fail to reimburse the Issuing Bank (through the Administrative Agent) for the full Dollar Equivalent amount of any drawing under any Letter of Credit by 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time, on the Drawing Date, the Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Bank thereof, and the Borrowers shall be deemed to have requested that Revolving Credit Loans be made by the Banks in Dollars under the Base Rate Option to be disbursed on the Drawing Date under such Letter of Credit, subject to the amount of the unutilized portion of the Revolving Credit Commitment and subject to the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan] other than any notice requirements.  Any notice given by the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.8.3.2 may be oral if immediately confirmed in writing; provided that the lack of such an immediate confirmation shall not affect the conclusiveness or binding effect of such notice. 
  2.8.4.3  Each Bank shall upon any notice pursuant to Section 2.8.3.2 make available to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Issuing Bank an amount in Dollars in immediately available funds equal to its Ratable Share (as determined in accordance with Section 2.14, if applicable) of the Dollar Equivalent amount of the drawing, whereupon the participating Banks shall (subject to Section 2.8.3.4) each be deemed to have made a Revolving Credit Loan in Dollars to the Borrowers under the Base Rate Option in that amount.  If any Bank so notified fails to make available in Dollars to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank the amount of such Bank's Ratable Share of such Dollar Equivalent amount by no later than 2:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time on the Drawing Date, then interest shall accrue on such Bank's obligation to make such payment, from the first Business Day after the Drawing Date to the date on which such Bank makes such payment (i) at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate during the first three days following the Drawing Date and (ii) at a rate per annum equal to the rate applicable to Loans under the Base Rate Option on and after the fourth day following the Drawing Date.  The Administrative Agent and the Issuing  
  
   47 

Bank will promptly give notice of the occurrence of the Drawing Date, but failure of the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank to give any such notice on the Drawing Date or in sufficient time to enable any Bank to effect such payment on such date shall not relieve such Bank from its obligation under this Section 2.8.3.3. 
  2.8.4.4  With respect to any unreimbursed drawing that is not converted into Revolving Credit Loans to the Borrowers under the Base Rate Option in whole or in part as contemplated by Section 2.8.3.2, because of the Borrowers' failure to satisfy the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 [Each Additional Loan] other than any notice requirements or for any other reason, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have incurred from the Issuing Bank a borrowing (each a "  Letter of Credit Borrowing  ") in Dollars equal to the Dollar Equivalent amount of such drawing.  Such Letter of Credit Borrowing shall be due and payable on demand (together with interest) and shall bear interest at the rate per annum applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans under the Base Rate Option.  Each Bank's payment to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.8.3.3 shall be deemed to be a payment in respect of its participation in such Letter of Credit Borrowing and shall constitute a "  Participation Advance  " from such Bank in satisfaction of its participation obligation under this Section 2.8.3. 
  2.8.4  Repayment of Participation Advances. 
  2.8.4.1  Upon (and only upon) receipt by the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank of immediately available funds from the Borrowers (i) in reimbursement of any payment made by the Issuing Bank under the Letter of Credit with respect to which any Bank has made a Participation Advance to the Issuing Bank, or (ii) in payment of interest on such a payment made by the Issuing Bank under such a Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Issuing Bank will pay to each Bank, in the same funds as those received by the Administrative Agent, the amount of such Bank's Ratable Share of such funds, except the Administrative Agent shall retain for the account of the Issuing Bank the amount of the Ratable Share of such funds of any Bank that did not make a Participation Advance in respect of such payment by the Issuing Bank. 
  2.8.4.2  If the Administrative Agent is required at any time to return to any Loan Party, or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian, or any official in any Insolvency Proceeding, any portion of the payments made by any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.8.4.1 in reimbursement of a payment made under the Letter of Credit or interest or fee thereon, each Bank shall, on demand of the Administrative Agent, forthwith return to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Issuing Bank the amount of its Ratable Share of any amounts so returned by the Administrative Agent plus interest thereon from the date such demand is made to the date such amounts are returned by such Bank to the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect from time to time. 
  2.8.5  Documentation. 
  Each Loan Party agrees to be bound by the terms of the Issuing Bank's application and agreement for letters of credit and the Issuing Bank's written regulations and customary  
  
   48 

practices relating to letters of credit, though such interpretation may be different from such Loan Party's own.  In the event of a conflict between such application or agreement and this Agreement, this Agreement shall govern.  It is understood and agreed that, except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Issuing Bank shall not be liable for any error, negligence and/or mistakes, whether of omission or commission, in following any Loan Party's instructions or those contained in the Letters of Credit or any modifications, amendments or supplements thereto. 
  2.8.6  Determinations to Honor Drawing Requests. 
  In determining whether to honor any request for drawing under any Letter of Credit by the beneficiary thereof, the Issuing Bank shall be responsible only to determine that the documents and certificates required to be delivered under such Letter of Credit have been delivered and that they comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of Credit. 
  2.8.7  Nature of Participation and Reimbursement Obligations. 
  Each Bank's obligation in accordance with this Agreement to make the Revolving Credit Loans or Participation Advances, as contemplated by Section 2.8.3, as a result of a drawing under a Letter of Credit, and the Obligations of the Borrowers to reimburse the Issuing Bank upon a draw under a Letter of Credit, shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.8 under all circumstances, including the following circumstances:

  (iii)  any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit; 
  (iv)  any claim of breach of warranty that might be made by any Loan Party or any Bank against any beneficiary of a Letter of Credit, or the existence of any claim, set-off, recoupment, counterclaim, cross-claim, defense or other right which any Loan Party or any Bank may have at any time against a beneficiary, successor beneficiary any transferee or assignee of any Letter of Credit or the proceeds thereof (or any Persons for whom any such transferee may be acting), the Issuing Bank or its Affiliates or any Bank or any other Person or, whether in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transaction (including any underlying transaction between any Loan Party or Subsidiaries of a Loan Party and the beneficiary for which any Letter of Credit was procured);

  2.8.9  Liability for Acts and Omissions. 
  As between any Loan Party and the Issuing Bank, or the Issuing Bank's Affiliates, such Loan Party assumes all risks of the acts and omissions of, or misuse of the Letters of Credit by, the respective beneficiaries of such Letters of Credit.  In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank shall not be responsible for any of the following including any losses or damages to any Loan Party or other Person or property relating therefrom:  (i) the form, validity, sufficiency, accuracy, genuineness or legal effect of any document submitted by any party in connection with the application for an issuance of any such Letter of Credit, even if it should in fact prove to be in any or all respects invalid, insufficient, inaccurate, fraudulent or forged (even if the Issuing Bank or its Affiliates shall have been notified thereof); (ii) the validity or sufficiency of any instrument transferring or assigning or purporting to transfer or assign any such Letter of Credit or the rights or benefits thereunder or proceeds thereof, in whole or in part, which may prove to be invalid or ineffective for any reason; (iii) the failure of the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit, or any other party to which such Letter of Credit may be transferred, to comply fully with any conditions required in order to draw upon such Letter of Credit or any other claim of any Loan Party against any beneficiary of such Letter of Credit, or any such transferee, or any dispute between or among any Loan Party and any beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any such transferee; (iv) errors, omissions, interruptions or delays in transmission or delivery of any messages, by mail, cable, telegraph, telex or otherwise, whether or not they be in cipher; (v) errors in interpretation of technical terms; (vi) any loss or delay in the transmission or otherwise of any document required in order to make a drawing under any such Letter of Credit or of the proceeds thereof; (vii) the misapplication by the beneficiary of any such Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under such Letter of Credit; or (viii) any consequences arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank or its Affiliates, as applicable, including any Governmental Acts, and none of the above shall affect or impair, or prevent the vesting of, any of the Issuing Bank's or its Affiliates rights or powers hereunder.  Nothing in the preceding sentence shall relieve the Issuing Bank from liability for the Issuing Bank's gross negligence or willful misconduct in connection with actions or omissions described in such clauses (i) through (viii) of such sentence.  In no event shall the Issuing Bank or its Affiliates be liable to any Loan Party for any indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special damages or expenses  
  
   51 

(including without limitation attorneys' fees), or for any damages resulting from any change in the value of any property relating to a Letter of Credit. 
  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Issuing Bank and each of its Affiliates (i) may rely on any oral or other communication believed in good faith by the Issuing Bank or such Affiliate to have been authorized or given by or on behalf of the applicant for a Letter of Credit, (ii) may honor any presentation if the documents presented appear on their face substantially to comply with the terms and conditions of the relevant Letter of Credit; (iii) may honor a previously dishonored presentation under a Letter of Credit, whether such dishonor was pursuant to a court order, to settle or compromise any claim of wrongful dishonor, or otherwise, and shall be entitled to reimbursement to the same extent as if such presentation had initially been honored, together with any interest paid by the Issuing Bank or its Affiliate; (iv) may honor any drawing that is payable upon presentation of a statement advising negotiation or payment, upon receipt of such statement (even if such statement indicates that a draft or other document is being delivered separately), and shall not be liable for any failure of any such draft or other document to arrive, or to conform in any way with the relevant Letter of Credit; (v) may pay any paying or negotiating bank claiming that it rightfully honored under the laws or practices of the place where such bank is located; and (vi) may settle or adjust any claim or demand made on the Issuing Bank or its Affiliate in any way related to any order issued at the applicant's request to an air carrier, a letter of guarantee or of indemnity issued to a carrier or any similar document (each an "Order") and honor any drawing in connection with any Letter of Credit that is the subject to such Order, notwithstanding that any drafts or other documents presented in connection with such Letter of Credit fail to conform in any way with such Letter of Credit. 
  In furtherance and extension and not in limitation of the specific provisions set forth above, any action taken or omitted by the Issuing Bank or its Affiliates under or in connection with the Letters of Credit issued by it or any documents and certificates delivered thereunder, if taken or omitted in good faith, shall not put the Issuing Bank or its Affiliates under any resulting liability to the Borrowers or any Bank. 
  4.9  Swing Loans. 
  2.9.1  Making Swing Loans. 
  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, PNC Bank may in its discretion make swing line loans in Dollars (the "  Dollar Swing Loans  ") or an Optional Currency (the "  Optional Currency Swing Loans  "  and together with the Dollar Swing Loans, each a "  Swing Loan  " and collectively, the "  Swing Loans  ") to the Borrowers from time to time prior to the Expiration Date in an aggregate outstanding principal amount up to the amount of the Dollar Swing Loan Commitment in the case of Dollar Swing Loans and the Optional Currency Swing Loan Commitment in the case of Optional Currency Swing Loans for periods requested by TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, and agreed to by PNC Bank;   provided  , that, no Swing Loan shall be made if, after giving effect to the making of such Swing Loan and the simultaneous application of the proceeds thereof, (x) the aggregate Dollar Equivalent Revolving Facility Usage of all of the Banks would exceed the aggregate amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments of all of the Banks or (y) the aggregate amount of all outstanding Revolving Credit Loans of a Bank plus such Bank's Ratable Share of the Dollar Equivalent amount of outstanding Swing Loans and  
  
   52 

Letter of Credit Outstandings would exceed its Revolving Credit Commitment.  Within the foregoing limits, the Borrowers may, prior to the Expiration Date borrow, repay and reborrow under each of the Dollar Swing Loan Commitment and the Optional Currency Swing Loan Commitment, as applicable, subject to and in accordance with the terms and limitations hereof.  The interest rate for a Dollar Swing Loan shall be the rate that is mutually agreed by TGI, on behalf of the Borrowers, and PNC Bank at the time such Swing Loan is made or, absent such an agreement, at the Base Rate.  The interest rate for an Optional Currency Swing Loan shall be the Euro-Rate.  Interest on the principal amount of each Optional Currency Swing Loan made in an Optional Currency shall be paid by the Borrowers in such Optional Currency,   provided that  , interest earned after an Optional Currency Swing Loan is converted to its Dollar Equivalent pursuant to Section 2.9.5 shall be payable in Dollars. 
  2.9.2  Swing Loan Request. 
  TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, may request a Swing Loan to be made on any Business Day.  Each request for a Swing Loan shall be in the form of a  Swing Loan Request (or a request by telephone immediately confirmed in writing, it being understood that PNC Bank may rely on the authority of any individual making such telephonic request without the necessity of receipt of such written confirmation) and received by the Administrative Agent not later than 1:00 p.m. (Pittsburgh time) on the Business Day a Dollar Swing Loan is to be made and four (4) Business Days prior to the proposed Borrowing Date with respect to making Optional Currency Swing Loans specifying (i)  the amount to be borrowed, (ii) the requested Borrowing Date, (iii) the date such Swing Loan is to be repaid, if applicable, which date shall be, with respect to Optional Currency Swing Loans, one Month from the Borrowing Date (the "  Swing Loan Repayment Date"  ) and (iv) the currency in which such Optional Currency Swing Loans shall be funded.  The request for such Swing Loan shall be irrevocable.  Provided that all applicable conditions precedent contained herein have been satisfied, PNC Bank shall, not later than 4:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, on the date specified in TGI's request for such Swing Loan, make such Swing Loan by crediting any Borrower's deposit account with PNC Bank. 
  2.9.3  Swing Loan Notes. 
  The obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Dollar Swing Loans and the Optional Currency Swing Loans shall be evidenced by separate promissory notes of the Borrowers dated the date hereof, payable to the order of PNC Bank in the principal amount of the Dollar Swing Loan Commitment and the Optional Currency Swing Loan Commitment, as applicable and substantially in the form of   Exhibit 1.1(S)(1)   Dollar Swing Loan Note (the "  Dollar Swing Loan Note  ") or   Exhibit 1.1(S)(2)     Optional Currency Swing Loan Note (the "  Optional Currency Swing Loan Note  "), as applicable (in each case, as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, each a "  Swing Loan Note  " and collectively, the "  Swing Loan Notes  "). 
  2.9.4  Repayment. 
  Swing Loans shall be repaid on the earlier of (i) the Expiration Date or (ii) the Swing Loan Repayment Date for such Swing Loan, provided that with respect to an Optional Currency Swing Loan, the Borrowers may renew the Interest Period thereon by delivering a  
  
   53 

Swing Loan Request therefor in accordance with the terms of Section 2.9.2.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any Swing Loan at any time shall be repaid upon demand by the Administrative Agent (any such date being the "  Swing Loan Conversion Date  ") and each Borrower shall indemnify PNC Bank and each other Bank pursuant to Section 5.5.2 on account of such repayment.  Unless TGI, on behalf of the Borrowers, shall have notified the Administrative Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, on such Swing Loan Conversion Date that the Borrowers intend to repay such Swing Loan with funds other than the proceeds of a Revolving Credit Loan, or, in the case of an Optional Currency Swing Loan, renew the Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have given notice to the Administrative Agent requesting the Banks to make Revolving Credit Loans in U.S. Dollars in an amount determined by PNC Bank in its sole discretion equal to the Dollar Equivalent at the prevailing market rate of such Swing Loans, which Revolving Credit Loans shall earn interest at the Base Rate in effect on the Swing Loan Conversion Date in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of such Swing Loan plus interest thereon, and the Banks shall, on the Swing Loan Conversion Date, make Revolving Credit Loans (without the requirement that they comply with the conditions for Revolving Credit Loans in Section 2.4 [Revolving Credit Loan Requests]), which shall earn interest at the Base Rate, in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of such Swing Loan plus interest thereon, the proceeds of which shall be applied directly by the Administrative Agent to repay PNC Bank for such Swing Loan then due plus accrued interest thereon; and provided, further, that if for any reason the proceeds of such Revolving Credit Loans are not received by PNC Bank on the Swing Loan Conversion Date in an aggregate amount equal to the amount of such Swing Loan then due plus accrued interest, the Borrowers shall reimburse PNC Bank on the day immediately following the Swing Loan Conversion Date, in same day funds, in an amount equal to the excess of the amount of such Swing Loan then due over the aggregate amount of such Revolving Credit Loans, if any, received plus accrued interest thereon. 
  2.9.5  Participations. 
  In the event that the Borrowers shall fail to repay PNC Bank as provided in Section 2.9.4, PNC Bank shall convert such Swing Loan, if an Optional Currency Swing Loan, to a Swing Loan in Dollars at the Dollar Equivalent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Bank of the unpaid Dollar Equivalent amount of such Swing Loan and of such Bank's respective participation therein in a Dollar Equivalent amount equal to such Bank's Ratable Share of such Swing Loan, as calculated at the date PNC Bank converts the Optional Currency in which Optional Currency Swing Loans are denominated to Dollars, if applicable.  Each Bank shall make available to the Administrative Agent for payment to PNC Bank a Dollar Equivalent amount equal to its respective participation therein (including without limitation its Ratable Share of accrued but unpaid interest thereon, provided that the interest rate payable by the participating Banks shall not include the Default Rate component), in Dollars and in same day funds at the office of the Administrative Agent specified in such notice.  If such notice is delivered by the Administrative Agent by 11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, each Bank shall make funds available to the Administrative Agent on that Business Day.  If such notice is delivered after 11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, each Bank shall make funds available to the Administrative Agent on the next Business Day.  In the event that any Bank fails to make available to the Administrative Agent the Dollar Equivalent amount of such Bank's participation in such unpaid  
  
   54 

amount as provided herein, PNC Bank shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Bank together with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Effective Rate for each day during the period between the date such participation amount is required to be paid and the date on which such Bank makes available its participation in such unpaid amount. The failure of any Bank to make available to the Administrative Agent its Ratable Share of any such unpaid amount shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligations hereunder to make available to the Administrative Agent its Ratable Share of such unpaid amount when due as set forth above. The Administrative Agent shall distribute to each Bank which has paid all amounts payable by it under this Section 2.9.5 with respect to the unpaid amount of any Swing Loan, such Bank's Ratable Share (based on its participation in such Swing Loan and interest thereon) of all payments received by the Administrative Agent from any of the Borrowers in repayment of such Swing Loan when such payments are received. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each Bank which has paid all amounts payable by it under this Section 2.9.5 shall have a direct right to repayment of such amounts from the Borrowers subject to the procedures for repaying Banks set forth in this Section 2.9.5 and the provisions of Section 5. 
  2.9.6  Termination. 
  In the event the Revolving Credit Commitments are terminated in accordance with the terms hereof, each of the Dollar Swing Loan Commitment and the Optional Currency Swing Loan Commitment shall also be terminated automatically.  In the event the Borrowers reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments to less than either the Dollar Swing Loan Commitment or the Optional Currency Swing Loan Commitment, such Swing Loan Commitment shall immediately be reduced to an amount equal to the Revolving Credit Commitments.  In the event the Borrowers reduce the Revolving Credit Commitments to less than the outstanding principal amount of the Dollar Swing Loans or the Optional Currency Swing Loans, the Borrowers shall immediately repay the amount by which such outstanding Swing Loans exceeds the Dollar Swing Loan Commitment or the Optional Currency Swing Loan Commitment, as applicable, as so reduced plus accrued interest thereon. 
  2.9.7  Minimum Amounts. 
  At no time shall there be more than (i) one (1) outstanding Dollar Swing Loan, except as to Swing Loans made pursuant to Section 2.9.9 and (ii) three (3) outstanding Optional Currency Swing Loans.  Each Dollar Swing Loan shall be in a minimum original principal amount of $100,000 and integral multiples thereof, except as to Swing Loans made pursuant to Section 2.9.9, as to which there shall be no minimum.  Each Optional Currency Swing Loan shall be in a minimum original principal amount of $1,000,000 and integral multiples thereof. 
  2.9.8  Prepayment. 
  The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay the Swing Loans, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (but in any event subject to Section 5.5.2), upon prior written, facsimile or telephonic notice to PNC Bank given by TGI on the Borrowers' behalf no later than 11:00 a.m., Pittsburgh time, on the date of any proposed prepayment.  Each notice of prepayment shall specify the Swing Loan to be prepaid and the amount to be prepaid, shall be irrevocable and shall commit the Borrowers to prepay such amount on such date, with accrued interest thereon and any other amounts owed hereunder. 
  
   55

Dollar Swing Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.9.9 in accordance with the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements shall (i) be subject to the limitations as to aggregate amount set forth in Section 2.9.1, (ii) not be subject to the limitations as to number or individual amount set forth in Sections 2.9.7 or the repayment provisions of Section 2.9.4, (iii) be payable by the Borrowers, both as to principal and interest, at the times set forth in the Cash Management Agreements (but in no event later than the Expiration Date), (iv) not be made at any time after PNC Bank has received written notice of the occurrence of a Potential Default or Event of Default, (v) if not repaid by the Borrowers in accordance with the provisions of the Cash Management Agreements, be subject to each Bank's obligation to purchase participating interests therein pursuant to Section 2.9.5, and (vi) except as provided in the foregoing subsections (i) through (v), be subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Section 2.9. The Borrowers acknowledge and agree that each Borrower materially benefits from the arrangements made pursuant to this Section 2.9.9 and the Cash Management Agreements, and each Borrower shall be jointly and severally liable, subject to Section 11.20, for all Obligations, including without limitation, those arising from the operation of this Section 2.9.9. 
  2.9.10  Nature of Obligations. 
  Each Bank's obligation to purchase participating interests pursuant to Section 2.9.5 in the event that the Borrowers shall fail to repay PNC Bank as provided in Section 2.9.4 in the amount required under such Section shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance including, without limitation, (i) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which such Bank may have against any other Bank or any Borrower, or any Borrower may have against any Bank or any other Person, as the case may be, for any reason  whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Potential Default or Event of Default; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of any of the Borrowers; (iv) any breach of this Agreement by any party hereto; (v) the failure to satisfy any condition to the making of any Loan hereunder; or (vi) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

  Each Bank shall ratably in accordance with its Ratable Share, indemnify PNC Bank (in its capacity as lender of Swing Loans), its affiliates and their respective directors, officers, agents and employees (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and expenses), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except any of the foregoing that results from the indemnitees' gross negligence or willful  
  
   56 

misconduct) that such indemnities may suffer or incur in connection with this Section 2.9 or any action taken or omitted by such indemnities hereunder. 
  4.10  Utilization of Optional Currency Swing Loans and Letters of Credit. 
  2.10.1  Periodic Computations of Dollar Equivalent Amounts of Loans and Letters of Credit Outstanding.

  PNC Bank shall be under no obligation to make the Optional Currency Swing Loans and no Issuing Bank shall be under any obligation to issue Letters of Credit requested by the Borrowers which are denominated in an Optional Currency if, PNC Bank or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Administrative Agent by 5:00 p.m. (Pittsburgh time) four (4) Business Days prior to the Borrowing Date for such Optional Currency Swing Loans or date of issuance that (i) the making, maintenance or funding of such Optional Currency Swing Loan, the issuance of such Letter of Credit, or the funding of any draw thereunder has been made or, in the case of a draw, would be made, impracticable or unlawful by compliance by PNC Bank or such Issuing Bank in good-faith with any Law or any interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any such Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law) or (ii) after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the relevant amount in the relevant Optional Currency for the relevant Interest Period are not available to PNC Bank with respect to such Optional Currency Swing Loan in the London interbank market.  In the event the Administrative Agent receives a timely notice from PNC Bank or an Issuing Bank pursuant to the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent will notify TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, (1) no later than 12:00 noon (Pittsburgh time) three (3) Business Days prior to the Borrowing Date for such Optional Currency Swing Loans that the Optional Currency is not then available for such Optional Currency Swing Loans, or (2) prior to the issuance of an Optional Currency Letter of Credit, that Letters of Credit are not then available in such Optional Currency.

   57

The Administrative Agent will promptly notify TGI of the acceptance or rejection by the Administrative Agent, of the Borrowers' request.  The requested currency shall be approved as an Optional Currency hereunder only if the Administrative Agent, PNC Bank and all of the Issuing Banks approve of the Borrowers' request. 
  4.11  Currency Repayments. 
  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the entire amount of principal of and interest on any Optional Currency Swing Loan shall be repaid in the same Optional Currency in which such Loan was made, provided, however, that if it is impossible or illegal for the Borrowers to effect payment of a Loan in the Optional Currency in which such Loan was made, or if the Borrowers default in their obligations to do so, PNC Bank, may at its option permit such payment to be made (i) at and to a different location, subsidiary, affiliate or correspondent of the Administrative Agent, or (ii) in the Dollar Equivalent, or (iii) in an Equivalent Amount of such other currency (freely convertible into Dollars) as the PNC Bank may solely at its option designate.  Upon any events described in (i) through (iii) of the preceding sentence, the Borrowers shall make such payment. In all events, whether described in such clauses (i) through (iii), whether the Borrowers make such required payments, or otherwise, (a) the Borrowers, jointly and severally, agree to hold PNC Bank, each Issuing Bank and each Bank harmless from and against any loss incurred by any of them arising from the cost to such  
  
   58 

indemnified party of any premium, any costs of exchange, the cost of hedging and covering the Optional Currency in which such Optional Currency Swing Loan was originally made, and from any change in the value of Dollars, or such other currency, in relation to the Optional Currency that was due and owing, and (b) each Bank agrees to hold PNC Bank and each Issuing Bank harmless from and against any loss incurred by PNC Bank or such Issuing Bank arising from the cost to PNC Bank or such Issuing Bank of any premium, any costs of exchange, the cost of hedging and covering the Optional Currency in which such Optional Currency Swing Loan or Letter of Credit, as the case may be, was originally made, and from any change in the value of Dollars or such other currency in relation to the Optional Currency that was due and owing. Such loss shall be calculated for the period commencing with the first day of the Interest Period for such Loan and continuing through the date of payment thereof.  Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrowers or Banks hereunder, the Borrowers' and Banks' respective obligations under this Section 2.11 shall survive termination of this Agreement. 
  4.12  Optional Currency Amounts. 
  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, PNC Bank may, with respect to notices by TGI on behalf of the Borrowers for Optional Currency Swing Loans or voluntary prepayments of less than the full amount of an Optional Currency Swing Loan, engage in reasonable rounding of the Optional Currency amounts requested to be loaned or repaid; and, in such event, PNC Bank shall promptly notify TGI, the Administrative Agent and the Banks of such rounded amounts and Borrowers' request or notice shall thereby be deemed to reflect such rounded amounts. 
  4.13  Intentionally Omitted. 
  4.14  Defaulting Banks. 
  Notwithstanding anything contained in Sections 2.8, 2.9 or any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Bank becomes a Defaulting Bank then: all Letters of Credit Outstanding and Swing Loans outstanding at such time, and all Letters of Credit issued or Swing Loans made while there exists a Defaulting Bank shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Banks in accordance with their respective Ratable Shares (such Ratable Shares shall be determined without reference to each Defaulting Bank's Ratable Share) so long as no Potential Default or Event of Default exists on the date of reallocation and thereafter continues uncured, but only to the extent (a) the sum of all non-Defaulting Banks' Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding plus the sum of such non-Defaulting Banks' Ratable Share of the Dollar Equivalent of all Swing Loans then outstanding and Letters of Credit Outstanding at such time does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Banks' Revolving Credit Commitments and (b) the aggregate obligation of each non-Defaulting Bank to acquire, refinance or fund any participations in the Defaulting Bank's portion of Letters of Credit Outstanding and Swing Loans pursuant to reallocation contemplated above shall not exceed the positive difference between (i) the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Bank   minus   (ii) such Bank's Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding plus such Bank's Ratable Share of the Dollar Equivalent of all Swing Loans then outstanding and Letters of Credit Outstanding at such time.  If the reallocation described in the preceding sentence cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent, (1) first, prepay  
  
   59 

outstanding Swing Loans and (2) second, cash collateralize such Defaulting Bank's portion of Letters of Credit Outstanding (in each case, after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant the immediately preceding sentence).  To the extent such Letters of Credit Outstanding and Swing Loans are reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.14, then the fees payable to the Banks pursuant to Section 2.8.2 (but not Section 2.3) shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Banks' Ratable Shares.  To the extent a portion of the Defaulting Bank's Letters of Credit outstanding are cash collateralized pursuant to clause (2) above, the Borrowers shall not be obligated to pay any fees to or for the account of such Defaulting Bank pursuant to Section 2.8.2 with respect to such Defaulting Bank's Letter of Credit Outstandings during the period such Defaulting Bank's Letter of Credit Outstandings are cash collateralized.  To the extent such Letters of Credit Outstanding are not reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.14, or the Defaulting Bank's Ratable Share of Letters of Credit Outstanding have not been cash collateralized, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Bank hereunder, all Commitment Fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Bank (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Bank's Commitment that was utilized by such Letters of Credit Outstanding) and Letter of Credit Fees with respect to such Defaulting Bank's Ratable Share of the Letters of Credit Outstanding shall be payable to the Issuing Bank.  Subject to Section 11.23, nothing contained in this Section or elsewhere in this Agreement and no reallocation of any Defaulting Bank's Ratable Share of any obligation hereunder shall relieve such Defaulting Bank of its obligation to fund any portion of any amount owed by such Defaulting Bank hereunder. 
  In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, and the Issuing Banks each agree that a Defaulting Bank has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Bank to be a Defaulting Bank, then the Letters of Credit Outstanding and the Swing Loans outstanding shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Bank's Revolving Credit Commitment and on such date, such Bank shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Banks as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Bank to hold such Loans in accordance with its Ratable Share. 
  4.15  Extension of Expiration Date. 
  Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Revolving Credit Commitments (or portions of the Revolving Credit Commitments) set forth on   Schedule 2.15   (the "  Expiring Commitments  ") shall automatically terminate on November 19, 2018 (the "  Original Expiration Date  "), and upon such termination, the Borrowers shall, (a) pay, with accrued interest and with any additional compensation required under Section 2.3 and Section 5.5.2, the amount of any Revolving Credit Loans related to such Expiring Commitments, (b) prepay any additional Revolving Credit Loans of the Banks to the extent that the Revolving Credit Usage exceeds the Revolving Credit Commitments (in each case after giving effect to the Expiring Commitments) and (c) make any other payments required hereunder, including without limitation, payments required under Section 2.8, Section 2.9 and Section 5.6.  After giving effect to the Expiring Commitments, all Letters of Credit Outstanding and Swing Loans outstanding at such time, and all Letters of Credit issued or Swing Loans made after the Original Expiration Date shall be reallocated among the Banks holding Revolving Credit Commitments after the Original Expiration Date in accordance with their respective Ratable Shares (as determined after giving effect to the Expiring Commitments and without

reference to any Bank's Expiring Commitment), but only to the extent, in each case, after giving effect to the Expiring Commitments, (x) the sum of all Banks' Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding plus the sum of such Banks' Ratable Share of the Dollar Equivalent of all Swing Loans then outstanding and Letters of Credit Outstanding at such time does not exceed the total of all such Banks' Revolving Credit Commitments and (y) the aggregate obligation of each Bank to acquire, refinance or fund any participations in the portion of Letters of Credit Outstanding and Swing Loans pursuant to the reallocation contemplated above shall not exceed, in each case, after giving effect to the Expiring Commitments, the positive difference between (i) the Revolving Credit Commitment of such Bank   minus   (ii) such Bank's Revolving Credit Loans then outstanding plus such Bank's Ratable Share of the Dollar Equivalent of all Swing Loans then outstanding and Letters of Credit Outstanding at such time.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the reallocation described in the preceding sentence cannot, or can only partially, be effected, or if a Default or Event of Default exists on the Original Expiration Date, the Borrowers shall within one Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent, (1) first, prepay the pro rata portion of outstanding Swing Loans related to the Expiring Commitments and (2) second, cash collateralize a pro rata portion of Letters of Credit Outstanding related to the Expiring Commitments (in each case, after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant the immediately preceding sentence).  Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary, each Bank party to the Sixth Amendment hereby agrees to this Section 2.15 and the non-pro rata treatment of certain payments as set forth in this Section. 
           3. 
    TERM LOANS 
     3.1  Term Loan Commitments. 
  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, and relying upon the representations and warranties herein set forth, each Bank severally agrees to make a term loan (the "  Term Loan  ") to the Borrowers on the Closing Date in such principal amount as the Borrowers shall request up to, but not exceeding such Bank's Term Loan Commitment. 
  3.2  Nature of Banks' Obligations with Respect to Term Loans; Repayment Terms. 
  The obligations of each Bank to make Term Loans to the Borrowers shall be in the proportion that such Bank's Term Loan Commitment bears to the Term Loan Commitments of all Banks to the Borrowers, but each Bank's Term Loan to the Borrowers shall never exceed its Term Loan Commitment.  The failure of any Bank to make a Term Loan shall not relieve any other Bank of its obligations to make a Term Loan nor shall it impose any additional liability on any other Bank hereunder.  The Banks shall have no obligation to make Term Loans hereunder after the Closing Date.  The Term Loan Commitments are not revolving credit commitments, and the Borrowers shall not have the right to borrow, repay and reborrow under Section 3.1 [Term Loan Commitments].  The Borrowers shall repay the outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan in quarterly installments, each on the first Business Day of each January, April, July and October, commencing April, 2014, as follows: 

61 

Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, on May 14, 2019 (the "  Original Term Loan Maturity Date  "), the Borrowers shall pay the outstanding principal portion of the Term Loan set forth on   Schedule 3.2   (the "  Expiring Term Loan  "; and the Term Loan less the Expiring Term Loan, the "  Continuing Term Loan  "), together with all unpaid interest on the Expiring Term Loan and all other sums outstanding hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents in connection with the Expiring Term Loan. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary, each Bank party to the Sixth Amendment hereby agrees to this Section 3.2 and the non-pro rata treatment of certain payments as set forth in this Section.  
  Following the Original Term Loan Maturity Date, commencing on the first Business Day of July, 2019, the Borrowers shall repay the outstanding principal amount of the Continuing Term Loan in quarterly installments, each on the first Business Day of each January, April, July and October, as follows: 

On the Term Loan Maturity Date the Borrowers shall pay all outstanding principal of the Continuing Term Loan, together with all unpaid interest thereon and all other sums outstanding hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents. 
  3.3  Term Notes. 
  The Obligation of the Borrowers to repay the unpaid principal amount of the Term Loans made by each Bank, together with interest thereon, shall be evidenced by a Term Note payable to the order of such Bank in a face amount equal to the Term Loan Commitment of such Bank. 
           4. 
    INTEREST RATES 
     4.1  Interest Rate Options. 
  The Borrowers shall pay interest in respect of the outstanding unpaid principal amount of the Loans as selected by them from the Base Rate Option or Euro-Rate Option set forth below applicable to the Loans, it being understood that, subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Borrowers may select different Interest Rate Options and different Interest Periods to apply simultaneously to the Loans comprising different Borrowing Tranches and may convert to or renew one or more Interest Rate Options with respect to all or any portion of the Loans comprising any Borrowing Tranche, provided that there shall not be at any one time outstanding more than ten (10) Borrowing Tranches in the aggregate among all of the Loans.  If at any time the designated rate applicable to any Loan made by any Bank exceeds such Bank's highest lawful  
  
   62 

rate, the rate of interest on such Bank's Loan shall be limited to such Bank's highest lawful rate.  The interest rate applicable to the Swing Loans shall be governed by Section 2.9. 
  4.5.1  Revolving Credit Interest Rate Options. 
  The Borrowers shall have the right to select from the following Interest Rate Options applicable to the Revolving Credit Loans, except that no Loan to which the Base Rate Option shall apply may be made in an Optional Currency: 
  (i)  Base Rate Option  :  A fluctuating rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 365/366 days, as the case may be, or, if the Base Rate is measured by reference to the Daily Euro Rate, 360 days, and in each case actual days elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the applicable number of basis points calculated under the Pricing Grid, such interest rate to change automatically from time to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the Base Rate; or 
  (ii)  Euro-Rate Option  :  A rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed, provided that, for Loans made in an Optional Currency for which a 365-day basis is the only market practice available to the Administrative Agent, such rate shall be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days and for the actual days elapsed) equal to the Euro-Rate plus the applicable number of basis points calculated under the Pricing Grid. 
  4.5.2  Term Loan Interest Rate Options. 
  The Borrower shall have the right to select from the following Interest Rate Options applicable to the Term Loans: 
  (i)  Term Loan Base Rate Option  :  A fluctuating rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, or, if the Base Rate is measured by reference to the Daily Euro Rate, 360 days, and in each case actual days elapsed) equal to the Base Rate plus the applicable number of basis points calculated under the Pricing Grid, such interest rate to change automatically from time to time effective as of the effective date of each change in the Base Rate; or 
  (ii)  Term Loan Euro-Rate Option  :  A rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and actual days elapsed) equal to the Euro-Rate plus the applicable number of basis point calculated under the Pricing Grid. 
  4.2  Rate Quotations. 
  TGI, on behalf of the Borrowers, may call the Administrative Agent on or before the date on which a Loan Request is to be delivered to receive an indication of the interest rates and the applicable currency exchange rates then in effect, but it is acknowledged that such projection shall not be binding on the Administrative Agent or the Banks nor affect the rate of interest or the calculation of Equivalent Amounts which thereafter are actually in effect when the election is made. 
  
   63 

4.3  Interest Periods. 
  At any time when the Borrowers shall select, convert to or renew a Euro-Rate Option, TGI, on behalf of the Borrowers, shall notify the Administrative Agent thereof by delivering a Loan Request at least four (4) Business Days prior to the effective date of such Interest Rate Option, with respect to an Optional Currency Swing Loan, and three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such Euro-Rate Option, with respect to a Dollar Loan.  The notice shall specify an interest period (the "  Interest Period  ") during which such Interest Rate Option shall apply, such Interest Period to be one, two, three or six Months, provided that, the sole Interest Period applicable to Optional Currency Swing Loans shall be one Month, and   provided further  , that: 
  4.5.1  Ending Date and Business Day. 
  Any Interest Period which would otherwise end on a date which is not a Business Day shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day unless such Business Day falls in the next calendar month, in which case such Interest Period shall end on the next preceding Business Day; 
  4.5.2  Amount of Borrowing Tranche. 
  The amount of each Borrowing Tranche of Euro-Rate Loans (other than Optional Currency Swing Loans, which are addressed in Section 2.9.7) shall be in integral multiples of $500,000 and not less than $2,000,000; 
  4.5.3  Termination Before Expiration Date. 
  The Borrowers shall not select, convert to or renew an Interest Period for any portion of the (i) Revolving Credit Loans that would end after the Expiration Date, or (ii) Term Loans that would end after the Term Loan Maturity Date; and 
  4.5.4  Renewals. 
  In the case of the renewal of a Euro-Rate Option at the end of an Interest Period, the first day of the new Interest Period shall be the last day of the preceding Interest Period, without duplication in payment of interest for such day. 
  4.4  Interest After Default. 
  To the extent permitted by Law, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default and until such time such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived and to the extent the Administrative Agent at the request of the Required Banks (or PNC Bank alone with respect to Swing Loans which are not converted to Revolving Credit Loans) elect (which election may be made without prior notice to the Borrowers): 
  
   64 

4.5.1  Letter of Credit Fees, Interest Rate. 
  The Letter of Credit Fees and the rate of interest borne by each Loan shall  equal the sum of (i) the interest rate per annum applicable under the Base Rate Option plus (ii) 2.0% per annum; and 
  4.5.2  Other Obligations. 
  Each other Obligation hereunder if not paid when due shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the rate of interest applicable under the  Base Rate Option plus an additional 2.0% per annum from the time such Obligation becomes due and payable and until it is Paid In Full. 
  4.5.3  Acknowledgment. 
  Each Borrower acknowledges that such increased rates reflect, among other things, the fact that such Loans or other amounts have become a substantially greater risk given their default status and that the Banks are entitled to additional compensation for such risk; and, all such interest shall be payable by the Borrowers upon demand by the Administrative Agent. 
  4.5  Euro-Rate Unascertainable. 
  4.5.1  Unascertainable. 
  If on any date on which a Euro-Rate would otherwise be determined, the Administrative Agent shall have determined that: 
  (i)  adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining such Euro-Rate, or 
  (ii)  a contingency has occurred which materially and adversely affects the London interbank eurodollar market relating to the Euro-Rate, then the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.5.3. 
  4.5.2  Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available. 
  If at any time any Bank shall have determined that: 
  (i)  the making, maintenance or funding of any Loan to which a Euro-Rate Option applies has been made impracticable or unlawful by compliance by such Bank in good-faith with any Law or any interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body or with any request or directive of any such Official Body (whether or not having the force of Law), or 
  (ii)  such Euro-Rate Option will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Bank of the establishment or maintenance of any such Loan, or 
  
   65 

(iii)  after making all reasonable efforts, deposits of the relevant amount in Dollars or in the Optional Currency (as applicable) for the relevant Interest Period for a Loan to which a Euro-Rate Option applies are not available to such Bank with respect to such Loan in the London interbank market, then the Administrative Agent shall have the rights specified in Section 4.5.3. 
  4.5.3  Administrative Agent's and Banks' Rights. 
  In the case of any event specified in subsection 4.5.1 above, the Administrative Agent shall promptly so notify the Banks and TGI, on behalf of the Borrowers, thereof, and in the case of an event specified in subsection 4.5.2 above, such Bank shall promptly so notify the Administrative Agent and endorse a certificate to such notice as to the specific circumstances of such notice, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly send copies of such notice and certificate to the other Banks and TGI on behalf of the Borrowers.  Upon such date as shall be specified in such notice (which shall not be earlier than the date such notice is given), the obligation of (A) the Banks, in the case of such notice given by the Administrative Agent, or (B) such Bank, in the case of such notice given by such Bank, to allow the Borrowers to select, convert to or renew a Euro-Rate Option or select an Optional Currency (as applicable) shall be suspended until the Administrative Agent shall have later notified TGI, on behalf of the Borrowers, or such Bank shall have later notified the Administrative Agent, of the Administrative Agent's or such Bank's, as the case may be, determination that the circumstances giving rise to such previous determination no longer exist.  If at any time the Administrative Agent makes a determination under subsection 4.5.1 of this Section 4.5 and TGI, on behalf of the Borrowers, has previously notified the Administrative Agent of their selection of, conversion to or renewal of a Euro-Rate Option and such Interest Rate Option has not yet gone into effect, such notification shall be deemed to provide for selection of, conversion to or renewal of the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loans.  If any Bank notifies the Administrative Agent of a determination under subsection 4.5.2 of this Section 4.5, the Borrowers shall, subject to the Borrowers' indemnification Obligations under Section 5.5.2, as to any Loan of the Bank to which a Euro-Rate Option applies, on the date specified in such notice either (i) as applicable, convert such Loan to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan or select a different Optional Currency or Dollars, or (ii) prepay such Loan in accordance with Section 5.4.  Absent due notice from TGI, on behalf of the Borrowers, of conversion or prepayment, such Loan shall automatically be converted to the Base Rate Option otherwise available with respect to such Loan upon such specified date. 
  4.6  Selection of Interest Rate Options. 
  If the Borrowers fail to select a new Interest Period or Optional Currency to apply to any Borrowing Tranche of Euro-Rate Loans at the expiration of an existing Interest Period applicable to such Borrowing Tranche in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.1 [Interest Periods], the Borrowers shall be deemed to have (a) with respect to Dollar Loans, converted such Borrowing Tranche to the Base Rate Option, commencing upon the last day of the existing Interest Period and (b) with respect to any such Optional Currency Swing Loan Borrowing Tranche, continued the same Optional Currency therefor, but selected a one Month Interest Period therefor, commencing upon the last day of the existing Interest Period. 
  
   66 

5.1  Payments. 
  All payments and prepayments to be made in respect of principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, Administrative Agent's Fee or other fees or amounts due from the Borrowers hereunder shall be payable prior to 1:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, on the date when due without presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the Borrowers, and without set-off, counterclaim or other deduction of any nature, and an action therefor shall immediately accrue.  Such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at the Principal Office for the ratable accounts of the Banks with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans or Term Loans in U.S. Dollars except that payments of principal or interest shall be made in the currency in which such Loan was made, and in immediately available funds, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly distribute such amounts to the Banks in immediately available funds,   provided     that   in the event payments are received by 1:00 p.m., Pittsburgh time, by the Administrative Agent with respect to the Loans and such payments are not distributed to the Banks on the same day received by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent shall pay the Banks the Federal Funds Effective Rate in the case of Loans or other amounts due in Dollars or the Overnight Rate in the case of Loans or other amounts due in an Optional Currency, with respect to the amount of such payments for each day held by the Administrative Agent and not distributed to the Banks.  The Administrative Agent's and each Bank's statement of account, ledger or other relevant record shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive as the statement of the amount of principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts owing under this Agreement (including the Equivalent Amounts of the applicable currencies where such computations are required) and shall be deemed an "account stated."  Except where payment is required earlier, as provided herein, the Borrowers agree to repay (i) with respect to the Term Loans, on the Term Loan Maturity Date, and (ii) with respect to the Revolving Credit Loans, on the Expiration Date, all principal, interest, fees and other Obligations with respect to such Loans then outstanding.  In the event that at any time the Dollar Equivalent Revolving Facility Usage exceeds the aggregate Revolving Credit Commitments, the Borrowers shall promptly repay such excess in immediately available funds. 
  5.2  Pro Rata Treatment of Banks. 
  Subject to Section 2.14, each borrowing shall be allocated to each Bank according to its Ratable Share, and each selection of, conversion to or renewal of any Interest Rate Option and each payment or prepayment by the Borrowers with respect to principal, interest, Commitment Fees, Letter of Credit Fees, or other fees (except for the Administrative Agent's Fee and the Issuing Banks' fronting fee) or amounts due from the Borrowers hereunder to the Banks with respect to the Loans, shall (except as provided in Section 4.5.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits not Available] in the case of an event specified in Section 4.5 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable], 5.4.2 [Replacement of a Bank] or 5.5 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances]) be made in proportion to the applicable Loans outstanding from each Bank and, if no such Loans are then outstanding, in proportion to the Ratable Share of each Bank.  Subject to Section 2.14, notwithstanding any of the foregoing, each borrowing or payment, repayment or prepayment by the Borrowers of principal, interest, fees or other amounts from the Borrowers with respect to Swing Loans shall be made by or to PNC Bank according to Section 2.9. 
  
   67 

5.3  Interest Payment Dates. 
  Interest on Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in arrears on the first Business Day of each October, January, April and July for the prior fiscal quarter, and on the date such Loans are Paid In Full.  Interest on Loans to which the Euro-Rate Option applies shall be due and payable in the currency in which such Loan was made on the last day of each Interest Period for those Loans and, if such Interest Period is longer than three (3) months, also on each day that interest would have been payable had successive Interest Periods of three months' duration been applicable to such Loans.  Interest on mandatory prepayments of principal under Section 5.6 shall be made in the currency in which such Loan was made and shall be due on the date such mandatory prepayment is due.  Interest on the principal amount of each Loan or other monetary Obligation shall be due and payable in the currency in which such Loan was made on demand after such principal amount or such other monetary Obligation becomes due and payable (whether on the stated maturity date, upon acceleration or otherwise). 
  5.4  Voluntary Prepayments and Commitment Reductions.   
  5.9.1  Right to Prepay. 
  The Borrowers shall have the right at their option from time to time to prepay the Loans in whole or part without premium or penalty (except as provided in subsection 5.4.2 below or in Section 5.5) in the currency in which such Loan was made: 
  (i)  at any time with respect to any Loan to which the Base Rate Option applies, 
  (ii)  on the last day of the applicable Interest Period with respect to Loans to which a Euro-Rate Option applies,   provided     however   the Borrowers may otherwise prepay such Loans upon payment of all amounts owing under Section 5.5.2 resulting from such prepayment, 
  (iii)  on the date specified in a notice by any Bank pursuant to Section 4.5.3 [Administrative Agent's and Banks' Rights] with respect to any Loan to which a Euro-Rate Option applies. 
  Whenever the Borrowers desire to prepay any part of the Loans, TGI shall provide a prepayment notice to the Administrative Agent on behalf of the Borrowers on or before (and in the case of Optional Currency Swing Loans, four (4) days before) the date of prepayment of Loans setting forth the following information: 
  (a)  the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made; 
  (b)  a statement indicating the application of the prepayment; and 
  
   68 

(c)  the total principal amount and currency of such prepayment, the Dollar Equivalent amount of which shall not be less than $200,000 for the Revolving Credit Loans. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, whenever the Borrowers desire to prepay any part of the Swing Loans TGI shall provide notice thereof on behalf of the Borrowers no later than 12:00 noon, Pittsburgh time, on the date of prepayment of Swing Loans setting forth the following information: 
  (x)    the date, which shall be a Business Day, on which the proposed prepayment is to be made; and 
  (y)    a statement indicating the application of the prepayment between the Swing Loans. 
  The amount of the payment shall not be less than $25,000 for any Swing Loan except for Swing Loans made pursuant to Section 2.9.9, as to which there shall be no minimum. 
  All prepayment notices shall be irrevocable.  The principal amount of the Loans for which a prepayment notice is given, together with interest on such principal amount, shall be due and payable on the date specified in such prepayment notice as the date on which the proposed prepayment is to be made in the currency in which such Loan was made.  All Term Loan prepayments permitted hereunder shall be applied pro rata against all unpaid installments of principal of the Term Loans.  Except as provided in Section 4.5.3, if the Borrowers prepay a Loan but fails to specify the applicable Borrowing Tranche which the Borrowers are prepaying, the prepayment shall be applied (i) first to Revolving Credit Loans and then to Term Loans; (ii) after giving effect to the allocations in clause (i) above and in the preceding sentence, first to the Loans to which the Base Rate Option applies, then to Dollar Loans to which the Euro-Rate Option applies, and then to Optional Currency Swing Loans.  Any prepayment hereunder shall be subject to the Borrowers' obligation to indemnify the Banks under Section 5.5.2. 
  5.9.2  Replacement of a Bank. 
  In the event any Bank (i) gives notice under Section 4.5.2, Section 5.5.1, or Section 11.20(vii), (ii) becomes a Defaulting Bank or otherwise does not fund Revolving Credit Loans in breach of its obligations under Section 2.5 or because the making of such Loans would contravene any Law applicable to such Bank, (iii) does not approve the extension of the Expiration Date and the Term Loan Maturity Date as contemplated by the Sixth Amendment and the consent of the Required Banks is obtained hereunder (such Bank, a "  Declining Bank  "), (iv) does not approve any other action as to which its consent is required  (other than the consent of the Administrative Agent under Section 11.1.1) and the consent of the Required Banks is obtained hereunder, or (v) becomes subject to the control of an Official Body (other than normal and customary supervision), then the Borrowers shall have the right at their option, with the consent of the Administrative Agent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, to prepay the Loans of such Bank in whole, together with all interest accrued thereon, and terminate such Bank's Commitment within ninety (90) days after (v) receipt of such Bank's notice under Section 4.5.2, 5.5.1, or 11.20(vii), (w) the date such Bank has become a Defaulting Bank or  
  
   69 

otherwise has failed to fund Revolving Credit Loans in breach of its obligations under Section 2.5 or because the making of such Loans would contravene Law applicable to such Bank, (x) the date of obtaining the consent which such Bank has not approved, (y) the date such Bank became subject to the control of an Official Body, (z) receipt of such Bank's or Issuing Bank's notice under Section 2.10.2;   provided   that the Borrowers shall also pay to such Bank at the time of such prepayment any amounts required under Section 5.5 and any accrued interest due on such amount and any related fees;   provided  , however, that the Commitment of such Bank shall be provided by one or more of the remaining Banks or a replacement bank reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent;   provided  , further, the remaining Banks shall have no obligation hereunder to increase their Commitments;   provided   further, in the case of an assignment by a Declining Bank under this Section 5.4.2, the remaining Bank(s) or the replacement bank(s) that is or are the assignees of the Declining Bank shall agree at the time of such assignment to the extension of the Expiration Date and the Term Loan Maturity Date (as contemplated by the Sixth Amendment), which agreement shall be set forth in a written instrument delivered and satisfactory to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent;   provided   further, in the event none of the Banks or any replacement bank acquire the Commitments of the Defaulting Bank the Borrowers may terminate such Defaulting Bank's Commitment and reduce the aggregate Commitments of all of the Banks by the amount of such Defaulting Bank's terminated Commitment subject to the provisions (other than the pro rata provisions) set forth in Section 5.4.3 below; provided that the Borrowers shall prepay the Loans of the Defaulting Bank and any amount required by Section 5.5 and any accrued interest due on such amount and any related fees.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may only be replaced subject to the requirements of Section 10.14 and an Issuing Bank may only be replaced if all applicable Letters of Credit which it has issued have expired, been terminated or replaced or cash collateral or backup letters of credit shall have been deposited. 
  5.9.3  Right to Reduce Commitments. 
  The Borrowers shall have the right at their option from time to time to reduce permanently the Revolving Credit Commitments upon at least one Business Day's advance notice to the Administrative Agent.  Each such permanent reduction shall be in the minimum amount of $5,000,000 and shall reduce the Revolving Credit Commitment of each Bank in proportion to its Ratable Share.  Upon the effective date of each permanent reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments, the Borrowers shall also prepay, with interest and with any additional compensation required under Section 5.5.2, the amount (if any) by which the Revolving Facility Usage at the time of the reduction exceeds the amount of the Revolving Credit Commitments as reduced. 
  5.9.4  Change of Lending Office. 
  Each Bank agrees that upon the occurrence of any event giving rise to increased costs or other special payments under Section 4.5.2 [Illegality; Increased Costs; Deposits Not Available] with respect to such Bank, it will, if requested by TGI on behalf of the Borrowers, use reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Bank) to designate another lending office for any Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event, provided that such designation is made on such terms that such Bank and its lending office suffer no economic, legal or regulatory disadvantage, with the object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving  
  
   70 

rise to the operation of such Section.  Nothing in this Section 5.4.4 shall affect or postpone any of the Obligations of the Borrowers or any other Loan Party or the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Bank provided in this Agreement. 
  5.5  Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances. 
  5.9.1  Increased Costs or Reduced Return Resulting From Reserves, Capital Adequacy Requirements, Expenses, Etc. 
  If any change in any Law, guideline or interpretation or application thereof by any Official Body charged with the interpretation or administration thereof or compliance with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of Law) of any central bank or other Official Body, including, without limitation, all requests, rules, guidelines or directives issued under or in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all requests, rules, guidelines or directives promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, regardless of the date adopted, issued, promulgated, or implemented: 
  (i)  imposes, modifies or deems applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against credits or commitments to extend credit extended by, or assets (funded or contingent) of, deposits with or for the account of, or other acquisitions of funds by, any Bank or any lending office of any Bank or the Issuing Bank, or 
  (ii)  subjects any of the Administrative Agent, PNC Bank as provider of the Swing Loans, the Issuing Bank or any Bank to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (ii) through (iv) of the definition of Excluded Taxes, or (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; 
  (iii)  imposes on any Bank or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other conditions, cost or expenses (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Bank or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
  (iv)  imposes, modifies or deems applicable any capital adequacy, liquidity or similar requirement (A) against assets (funded or contingent) of, or letters of credit, other credits or commitments to extend credit extended by, any Bank or Issuing Bank, or (B) otherwise applicable to the obligations of any Bank or any lending office of any Bank or any Issuing Bank under this Agreement, 
  and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to the Administrative Agent, PNC Bank as provider of the Swing Loan, the Issuing Bank or any Bank of making, converting to, or continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to any of them of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the  
  
   71 

amount of sum received or receivable by, such Bank, Administrative Agent, PNC Bank or Issuing Bank, whether of principal, interest or any other amount (or, in the case of any capital adequacy, liquidity or similar requirement, to have the effect of reducing the rate of return on any Bank's or Issuing Bank's capital, taking into consideration such Bank's or Issuing Bank's customary policies with respect to capital adequacy or liquidity) by an amount which such Bank or Issuing Bank in its sole discretion deems to be material, such Bank or Issuing Bank shall from time to time notify TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, and the Administrative Agent of the amount determined in good-faith (using any reasonable averaging and attribution methods) by such Bank or Issuing Bank to be necessary to compensate such Bank or Issuing Bank for such increase in cost, reduction of income or additional expense (to the extent not reflected in the determination of Base Rate).  Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination.  Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrowers to such Bank or Issuing Bank ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given.  Failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent, PNC Bank as the provider of Swing Loans, any Bank or Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 5.5 shall not constitute a waiver of the Administrative Agent's, PNC Bank's, such Bank's or Issuing Bank's right to demand such compensation;   provided   that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate the Administrative Agent, PNC Bank, a Bank or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 5.5 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that the Administrative Agent, PNC Bank, such Bank or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrowers of change in Law or other circumstances described above giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of the Administrative Agent, PNC Bank's, such Bank's or Issuing Bank's intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the change in Law or other circumstances described above giving rise to such increase costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect). 
  5.9.2  Indemnity. 
  In addition to the compensation required by subsection 5.5.1 of this Section 5.5, each Borrower shall indemnify each Bank and each Issuing Bank against all liabilities, losses or expenses (including loss of margin, any loss or expense incurred in liquidating or employing deposits from third parties and any loss or expense incurred in connection with funds acquired by a Bank or Issuing Bank to fund or maintain Loans subject to the Euro-Rate Option) which such Bank or Issuing Bank actually sustains or incurs as a consequence of any: 
  (i)  payment, prepayment, conversion or renewal of any Loan to which the Euro-Rate Option applies on a day other than the last day of the corresponding Interest Period (whether or not such payment or prepayment is mandatory, voluntary or automatic and whether or not such payment or prepayment is then due), 
  (ii)  attempt by any Borrower to revoke (expressly, by later inconsistent notices or otherwise) in whole or part any notice relating to Loan Requests under Section 2.4 or Section 4.3 or prepayments under Section 5.4, 
  (iii)  default by any Borrower in the performance or observance of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document,  
  
   72 

including any failure of the Borrowers to pay when due (by acceleration or otherwise) any principal, interest, Commitment Fee or any other amount due hereunder, or 
  (iv)  the assignment of any Loans under the Euro-Rate Option other than on the last day of the Interest Period or maturity date applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrowers pursuant to Section 5.4.2. 
  If any Bank or Issuing Bank actually sustains or incurs any such loss or expense, it shall from time to time notify TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, of the amount determined in good-faith by such Bank (which determination may include such reasonable assumptions, allocations of costs and expenses and averaging or attribution methods as such Bank or Issuing Bank shall determine) to be necessary to indemnify such Bank or Issuing Bank for such loss or expense.  Such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such determination.  Such amount shall be due and payable by the Borrowers to such Bank or Issuing Bank, as the case may be, ten (10) Business Days after such notice is given. 
  5.6  Mandatory Prepayments.  
  5.9.1  Currency Fluctuations; Application Among Interest Rate Options. 
  If on any Computation Date (i) the Dollar Equivalent Revolving Facility Usage is greater than the Revolving Credit Commitments, (ii) the Dollar Equivalent of Optional Currency Swing Loans shall exceed the Optional Currency Swing Loan Commitment, or (iii) the Dollar Equivalent of Letters of Credit Outstanding shall exceed $100,000,000, as a result of a change in exchange rates between one (1) or more Optional Currencies and Dollars, then the Administrative Agent shall notify TGI, as agent for the Borrowers of the same.  The Borrowers shall pay or prepay the Revolving Credit Loans and/or Swing Loans (subject to Borrowers' indemnity obligations under Sections 5.4 [Voluntary Prepayments] and 5.5 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances]) within one (1) Business Day after TGI receives such notice such that after giving effect to such payments or prepayments, (a) the Dollar Equivalent Revolving Facility Usage shall not exceed the Revolving Credit Commitments, and (b) the Dollar Equivalent of Optional Currency Swing Loans shall not exceed the Optional Currency Swing Loan Commitment.  With respect to the circumstance identified in clause (iii) of the first sentence of this paragraph, the Borrowers shall Cash Collateralize the Letters of Credit Outstanding to the extent of the amount by which the Dollar Equivalent of Letters of Credit Outstanding exceeds $100,000,000. All prepayments required pursuant to this Section 5.6.1 [Currency Fluctuations; Application Among Interest Rate Options] shall first be applied among the Interest Rate Options to the principal amount of the Revolving Credit Loans subject to the Base Rate Option, then to Revolving Credit Loans subject to a Euro-Rate Option and then to Optional Currency Swing Loans subject to the Euro-Rate Option.  In accordance with Section 5.5.2 [Indemnity], each Borrower shall indemnify the Banks for any loss or expense, including loss of margin, incurred with respect to any such prepayments applied against Loans subject to a Euro-Rate Option on any day other than the last day of the applicable Interest Period.  
  
   73 

5.9.2  Specified Asset Sales. 
  The Borrowers shall prepay the Term Loans in an amount equal to 65% of the Net Asset Sale Proceeds received from the Specified Asset Sales. Such prepayment shall be made no later than 90 days following consummation of the Final Specified Asset Sale (the "  Specified Asset Sale Prepayment Date  ");   provided     that   in the event any Specified Asset Sale is consummated after the Specified Asset Sale Prepayment Date, then the prepayment relating to such Specified Asset Sale shall be made within 90 days following the consummation of such Specified Asset Sale. All Term Loan prepayments required hereunder shall be applied pro rata against all unpaid installments of principal of the Term Loans and shall be applied first, among the Interest Rate Options to the principal amount of such unpaid installments of the Term Loans that are subject to the Base Rate Option and then to the principal amount of such unpaid installments of the Term Loans that are subject to a Euro-Rate Option.  
  5.7  Interbank Market Presumption. 
  For all purposes of this Agreement and each Note with respect to any aspects of the Euro-Rate, any Loan under the Euro-Rate Option or any Optional Currency, each Bank and the Administrative Agent shall be presumed to have obtained rates, funding, currencies, deposits, and the like in the applicable interbank market regardless whether it did so or not; and, each Bank's and the Administrative Agent's determination of amounts payable under, and actions required or authorized by, Sections 4.5 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable] and 5.5 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances] shall be calculated, at each Bank's and the Administrative Agent's option, as though each Bank and the Administrative Agent funded its each Borrowing Tranche of Loans under the Euro-Rate Option through the purchase of deposits of the types and maturities corresponding to the deposits used as a reference in accordance with the terms hereof in determining the Euro-Rate applicable to such Loans, whether in fact that is the case. 
  5.8  Taxes. 
  For purposes of this Section, the term "  Bank  " includes any Issuing Bank and PNC Bank as provider of the Swing Loans. 
  5.9.1  Payments Free of Taxes. 
  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Loan Parties hereunder or under any other Loan Documents shall be made free and clear of and without reduction or withholding for any Taxes except as required by applicable Law.  If any applicable Law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 5.8 [Taxes]) the applicable Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent  
  
   74 

receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
  5.9.2  Payment of Other Taxes by the Loan Parties. 
  The Loan Parties shall timely pay to the relevant Official Body in accordance with applicable Law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
  5.9.3  Indemnification by the Loan Parties. 
  The Loan Parties shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Bank, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 5.8 [Taxes]) payable or paid by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or such Bank, as the case may be, or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Bank, the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrowers by a Bank (with copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  5.9.4  Indemnification by the Banks. 
  Each Bank shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Bank (but only to the extent that any Loan Party has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of any of the Loan Parties to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Bank's failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.11.4 [Participations] relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register, and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Bank, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Official Body.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Bank by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Bank under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Bank from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 5.8.4 [Indemnification by the Banks]. 
  5.9.5  Evidence of Payments. 
  As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Loan Parties to an Official Body, the Loan Parties (or any one of them) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Official Body evidencing such payment, a  
  
   75 

copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
  5.9.6  Status of Banks. 
  (i)  Any Bank that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrowers (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding.  In addition, any Bank, if requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable Law or reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Bank is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 5.8.6(ii)(a), (ii)(b) and (ii)(d) below) shall not be required if in the Bank's reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Bank to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Bank. 
  (ii)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in the event that any Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States of America: 
  (a)  any Bank that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Bank becomes a Bank hereunder (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), properly executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Bank is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax; 
  (b)  any Foreign Bank, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Bank becomes a Bank under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:

   76 

(2)  duly completed and executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;

  (4)  to the extent a Foreign Bank is not the beneficial owner, properly executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E, as applicable, a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit 5.8.6(B)   or   Exhibit 5.8.6(C)  , IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;   provided   that if the Foreign Bank is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Bank are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Bank may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of   Exhibit 5.8.6(D)   on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner; 
  (c)  any Foreign Bank shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Bank becomes a Bank under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable Law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable Law to permit the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
  (d)  if a payment made to a Bank under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Bank were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Bank shall deliver to the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable Law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(c)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Bank has complied with such Bank's obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (d), "FATCA" shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
  
   77 

Each Bank agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrowers and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
  5.9.7  Refund. 
  If any party determines, in its reasonable discretion, that it has received a refund in respect of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section 5.8 [Taxes], (including by payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section 5.8 [Taxes]), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section 5.8 [Taxes] with respect to the Taxes (including without limitation Other Taxes) giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) of the indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Official Body with respect to such refund or credit).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this Section 5.8.8 (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Official Body) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund or credit to such Official Body.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.8.7, in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this Section 5.8.7, the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after-Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund or credit had never been paid.  This paragraph shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person. 
  5.9.8  Survival. 
  Each party's obligations under this Section 5.8 [Taxes] shall survive the resignation of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Bank, the termination of the Revolving Credit Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations.

   78 

HMRC DTTP number, and upon receipt thereof, the Loan Parties each agree to promptly complete and file such forms, certificates and documents and otherwise cooperate with such Bank, as such Bank may request from time to time, in order for such Bank to establish that such Bank is not subject to, or is entitled to a reduction in the amount of or exemption from, any deduction, withholding or other Taxes with respect to any payment to such Bank, including HMRC Form DTTP 2.  The relevant Borrower and such Bank shall each provide all reasonable information and assistance to the Internal Revenue Service and Inland Revenue on a timely basis in order efficiently to process the relevant treaty claim, and shall keep each other (through the Administrative Agent) informed of any matters relating to such claim, including such Borrower providing a copy of any direction (or other authority) issued by the HM Revenue   Customs authorizing such Borrower to pay free and clear of any withholding on account of United Kingdom income tax and of any cancellation thereof. 
  5.9  Judgment Currency. 
  5.9.1  Currency Conversion Procedures for Judgments. 
  If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder or under a Note in any currency (the "  Original Currency  ") into another currency (the "  Other Currency  "), the parties hereby agree, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures each Bank could purchase the Original Currency with the Other Currency after any premium and costs of exchange on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. 
  5.9.2  Indemnity in Certain Events. 
  The obligation of the Borrowers in respect of any sum due from the Borrowers to any Bank hereunder shall, notwithstanding any judgment in an Other Currency, whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise, be discharged only to the extent that, on the Business Day following receipt by any Bank of any sum adjudged to be so due in such Other Currency, such Bank may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Original Currency with such Other Currency.  If the amount of the Original Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to such Bank in the Original Currency, each Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment or payment, to indemnify such Bank against such loss.

The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action hereunder unless it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Banks against any and all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. 
  10.9  Notice of Default. 
  The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of any Potential Default or Event of Default unless the Administrative Agent has received written notice from a Bank or TGI referring to this Agreement, describing such Potential Default or Event of Default and stating that such notice is a "notice of default."

TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, and the other Banks of each change in the Base Rate and the effective date thereof. 
  10.11  Banks in Their Individual Capacities. 
  With respect to its Revolving Credit Commitments, the Revolving Credit Loans made by it, the Administrative Agent shall have the same rights and powers hereunder as any other Bank and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent, and the term "  Banks  " shall, unless the context otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity.  PNC Bank and its Affiliates and each of the Banks and their respective Affiliates may, without liability to account, except as prohibited herein, make loans to, accept deposits from, discount drafts for, act as trustee under indentures of, and generally engage in any kind of banking or trust business with, any Borrower and their Affiliates, in the case of the Administrative Agent, as though it were not acting as Administrative Agent hereunder and in the case of each Bank, as though such Bank were not a Bank hereunder.

The Banks or any such holder receiving any such amount shall purchase for cash from each of the other Banks an interest in such Bank's Loans in such amount as shall result in a ratable participation by the Banks and each such holder in the aggregate unpaid amount under the Notes,   provided   that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter recovered from the Bank or the holder making such purchase, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, together with interest or other amounts, if any, required by law (including court order) to be paid by the Bank or the holder making such purchase.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no payments received from a Foreign Borrower shall be used to satisfy obligations of a Domestic Borrower. 
  
   126 

10.14  Successor Administrative Agent. 
  The Administrative Agent may resign as Administrative Agent by giving not less than thirty (30) days' prior written notice to TGI, as agent for the Borrowers.  If the Administrative Agent shall resign under this Agreement, then either (a) the Required Banks shall appoint from among the Banks a successor agent for the Banks, subject (provided that there does not exist an Event of Default) to the consent of TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, or (b) if a successor agent shall not be so appointed and approved within the thirty (30) day period following the Administrative Agent's notice to the Banks of its resignation, then the Administrative Agent shall appoint, with the consent of TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, a successor agent who shall serve as Administrative Agent until such time as the Required Banks appoint and TGI, as agent for the Borrowers consents to the appointment of a successor agent;   provided   that, in either case, in no event shall any such successor Administrative Agent be a Defaulting Bank or Disqualified Institution.  Upon its appointment pursuant to either clause (a) or (b) above, such successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the Administrative Agent, and the term "  Administrative Agent  " shall mean such successor agent,     effective upon its appointment, and the former Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent (and as Funding Bank) shall be terminated without any other or further act or deed on the part of such former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement.  After the resignation of any Administrative Agent hereunder, the provisions of this Article 9 shall inure to the benefit of such former Administrative Agent and such former Administrative Agent shall not by reason of such resignation be deemed to be released from liability for any actions taken or not taken by it while it was an Administrative Agent under this Agreement. 
  10.15  Administrative Agent's Fee. 
  The Borrowers shall pay to the Administrative Agent a nonrefundable fee (the "  Administrative Agent's Fee  ") under the terms of a letter (the "  Administrative Agent's Letter  ") between TGI, as agent for the Borrowers, and Administrative Agent, as amended from time to time. 
  10.16  Availability of Funds. 
  Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified by a Bank prior to the date and time upon which a Loan is to be made that such Bank does not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent such Bank's portion of such Loan, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Bank has made or will make such proceeds available to the Administrative Agent on such date and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to), make available to the Borrowers a corresponding amount in the applicable currency.  If such corresponding amount is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Bank in the applicable currency, the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such amount on demand from such Bank (or, if such Bank fails to pay such amount forthwith upon such demand from TGI, as agent for the Borrowers) together with interest thereon, in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was made available to the Borrowers and ending on the date the Administrative Agent recovers such amount, at a rate per annum equal to the applicable interest rate in respect of the Loan. 
  
   127 

10.17  Calculations. 
  In the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct, the Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any error in computing the amount payable to any Bank or Issuing Bank whether in respect of the Loans, fees or any other amounts due to the Banks or Issuing Banks under this Agreement.  In the event an error in computing any amount payable to any Bank is made, the Administrative Agent, the Borrowers and each affected Bank shall, forthwith upon discovery of such error, make such adjustments as shall be required to correct such error, and any compensation therefor will be calculated at the Federal Funds Effective Rate. 
  10.18  No Reliance on Administrative Agent's Customer Identification Program. 
  Each Bank and Issuing Bank acknowledges and agrees that neither such Bank, Issuing Bank, nor any of its Affiliates, participants or assignees, may rely on the Administrative Agent to carry out such Bank's, Issuing Bank's, Affiliate's, participant's or assignee's customer identification program, or other obligations required or imposed under or pursuant to the USA Patriot Act or the regulations thereunder, including the regulations contained in 31 CFR 103.121 (as hereafter amended or replaced, the "  CIP Regulations  "), or any other Anti-Terrorism Law, including any programs involving any of the following items relating to or in connection with any of the Loan Parties, their Affiliates or their agents, the Loan Documents or the transactions hereunder or contemplated hereby: (1) any identity verification procedures, (2) any recordkeeping, (3) comparisons with government lists, (4) customer notices or (5) other procedures required under the CIP Regulations or such other Laws. 
  10.19  Beneficiaries. 
  Except as expressly provided herein, the provisions of this Article 9 are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Banks, and the Borrowers shall not have any rights to rely on or enforce any of the provisions hereof.  In performing its functions and duties under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall act solely as agent of the Banks and does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation toward or relationship of agency or trust with or for any Borrower. 
  10.20  Authorization to Release Collateral and Guarantors. 
  In the event that any Loan Party conveys, sells, leases, assigns, transfers or otherwise disposes of all or any portion of any of the Capital Stock or assets of any Subsidiary to a person that is not (and is not required to become) a Domestic Loan Party in a transaction permitted under Section 8.2.4(viii), Section 8.2.7 [Disposition of Assets] or 8.2.6 [Liquidations, Mergers, Consolidations, Acquisitions], any Liens created by any Loan Document on such Capital Stock or assets so disposed of shall be automatically released and the Administrative Agent shall promptly (and the Banks hereby authorize the Administrative Agent to) take such action and execute any such documents as may be reasonably requested by TGI (and at TGI's expense) to release (or release or subordinate on terms acceptable to the Administrative Agent in the case of the sale and leaseback of equipment, provided the Loan Parties are in compliance with Section 8.2.1(i)(g)) any Liens created by any Loan Document on such Capital Stock or assets so disposed of, and, in the case of a disposition of the Capital Stock of any Subsidiary Loan Party in a

  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, no agreement, waiver or consent which would modify the interests, rights or obligations of the (i) Administrative Agent in its capacity as Administrative Agent or the provider of the Swing Loans shall be effective without the written consent of the Administrative Agent or (ii) Issuing Bank in its capacity as the issuer of Letters of Credit shall be effective without the written consent of such Issuing Bank.

The Banks will attempt to minimize the fees and expenses of legal counsel for the Banks which are subject to reimbursement by the Borrowers hereunder by considering the usage of one law firm to represent the Banks and the Administrative Agent if appropriate under the circumstances.  The Borrowers agree unconditionally to pay all stamp, document, transfer, recording or filing taxes or fees and similar impositions now or hereafter determined by the Administrative Agent or any Bank to be payable in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, and the Borrowers agree unconditionally to save the Administrative Agent and the Banks harmless from and against any and all present or future claims, liabilities or losses with respect to or resulting from any omission to pay or delay in paying any such taxes, fees or impositions.  To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no Loan party shall assert, and each Loan party hereby waives, any claim against any Bank, on the theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Documents or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, any Loan or the use of the  
  
   131 

proceeds thereof.  The indemnifications set forth herein shall be in addition to the indemnifications elsewhere set forth in this Agreement. The provisions of this Section shall survive and continue after repayment of the Obligations and termination of this Agreement. 
  11.4  Holidays. 
  Whenever payment of a Loan to be made or taken hereunder shall be due on a day which is not a Business Day such payment shall be due on the next Business Day and such extension of time shall be included in computing interest and fee, except that the Loans shall be due on the Business Day preceding the Expiration Date if the Expiration Date is not a Business Day.  Whenever any payment or action to be made or taken hereunder (other than payment of the Loans) shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a business Day, such payment or action shall be made or taken on the next following Business Day (except as provided in Section 4.3 with respect to Interest Periods under the Euro-Rate Option), and such extension of time shall not be included in computing interest or fees, if any, in connection with such payment or action. 
  11.5  Funding by Branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate. 
  11.12.1         Notional Funding. 
  Each Bank shall have the right from time to time, without notice to any Borrower, to deem any branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate (which for the purposes of this Section 11.5 shall mean any corporation or association which is directly or indirectly controlled by or is under direct or indirect common control with any corporation or association which directly or indirectly controls such Bank) of such Bank to have made, maintained or funded any Loan to which the Euro-Rate Option applies at any time,   provided     that   immediately following (on the assumption that a payment were then due from the Borrowers to such other office), and as a result of such change, the Borrowers would not be under any greater financial obligation pursuant to Section 5.5 than they would have been in the absence of such change.  Notional funding offices may be selected by each Bank without regard to the Bank's actual methods of making, maintaining or funding the Loans or any sources of funding actually used by or available to such Bank. 
  11.12.2         Actual Funding. 
  Each Bank shall have the right from time to time to make or maintain any Loan by arranging for a branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate of such Bank to make or maintain such Loan subject to the last sentence of this Section 11.5.2.  If any Bank causes a branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate to make or maintain any part of the Loans hereunder, all terms and conditions of this Agreement shall, except where the context clearly requires otherwise, be applicable to such part of the Loans to the same extent as if such Loans were made or maintained by such Bank, but in no event shall any Bank's use of such a branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate to make or maintain any part of the Loans hereunder cause such Bank or such branch, Subsidiary or Affiliate to incur any cost or expenses payable by the Borrowers hereunder or require the Borrowers to pay any other compensation to any Bank which would otherwise not be incurred. 
  
   132 

11.6  Notices.

Such register shall be conclusive, and the Borrowers, the Administrative Agent and the Banks may treat each Person whose name is in such register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Bank hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary.  Such register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Bank, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, a Note or any other Loan Document, the Loans and any other Obligations are registered obligations and the right, title and interest of any Bank or Issuing Bank and its assignees in and to such Loans or Obligations shall be transferable only upon notation of such transfer in the register.  This Section 11.11.3 shall be construed so that the Loans and other Obligations are at all times maintained in "registered form" within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and any related regulations (and any other relevant or successor provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or such regulations). 
  11.12.4                 Participations. 
  Any Bank may at any time, without the consent of, or notice to, the Borrowers or the Administrative Agent, sell participations to any Person (other than (a) a natural Person, or a holding company, investment vehicle or trust for, or owned and operated for the primary benefit of, a natural Person, (b) the Borrowers or any of the Borrowers' Affiliates or Subsidiaries, (c) any Disqualified Institution, (d) any Defaulting Bank or any of its Subsidiaries or (e) a Bank, Affiliate of a Bank or an Approved Fund that, in each case at the time of such participation, is a Sanctioned Person) (each, a "  Participant  ") in all or a portion of such Bank's rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitment and/or the Loans owing to it); provided that (i) such Bank's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Bank shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Banks shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Bank in connection with such Bank's rights and obligations under this Agreement. 
  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Bank sells such a participation shall provide that such Bank shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any  provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Bank will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree (other than as is already provided for herein) to any amendment, modification or waiver with respect to Section 11.1.1 [Increase of Commitment; Extension of Expiration Date], Section 11.1.2 [Extension of Payment; Reduction of Principal Interest or Fees; Modification of Terms of Payment], or Section 11.1.4 [Release of Collateral or Guarantor] that affects such Participant.  Subject to Section 11.11.5 [Limitations upon Participant Rights  
  
   137 

Successors and Assigns Generally], the Borrowers agree that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 4.5 [Euro-Rate Unascertainable] Section 5.5 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances]     to the same extent as if it were a Bank and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 11.11.2 [Assignments by Banks], Section 5.8 [Taxes] and Section 11.3 [Reimbursement and Indemnification of Banks by the Borrower; Taxes], provided that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Section 5.4.2 [Replacement of a Bank] as if it were an assignee under Section 11.11.2 [Assignments by Banks]; and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 5.5 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances] or 5.8 [Taxes], with respect to any participation, than its participating Bank would have been entitled to receive, except to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a change in law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Bank that sells a participation agrees, at the Borrowers' request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrowers to effectuate the provisions of Section 5.4.2 [Replacement of a Bank] with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.2.3 as though it were a Bank; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 5.2 [Pro-Rata Treatment of Banks] as though it were a Bank.  Each Bank that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrowers, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant's interest in the Loans or other Obligations under the Loan Documents (the "  Participant Register  "); provided that no Bank shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant's interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other Obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Bank shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, a Note or any other Loan Document, the right, title and interest of any Participant and its assignees in the Loans or other Obligations shall be transferable only upon notation of such transfer in the Participant Register.  This Section 11.11.4 shall be construed so that the Loans and other Obligations (and the participations sold therein) are at all times maintained in "registered form" within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code and any related regulations (and any other relevant or successor provisions of the Internal Revenue Code or such regulations).  For the avoidance of doubt, the Administrative Agent (in its capacity as Administrative Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register. 
  11.12.5         Limitations upon Participant Rights Successors and Assigns Generally. 
  A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 5.5 [Additional Compensation in Certain Circumstances], Section 5.8 [Taxes] or Section 11.3 [Reimbursement and Indemnification of Bank by the Borrower; Taxes ]     than the  
  
   138 

applicable Bank would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower's prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Bank if it were a Bank shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 5.8 [Taxes]     unless the Borrowers are notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrowers, to comply with Section 5.8.6 [Status of Banks]     as though it were a Bank. 
  11.12.6         Certain Pledges; Successors and Assigns Generally. 
  Any Bank may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Bank, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank; provided that no such pledge or assignment shall release such Bank from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Bank as a party hereto.

  11.20  Joinder of Borrowers and Guarantors. 
  (i)  Each Domestic Material Subsidiary acquired, formed or in existence after the Closing Date shall be required to, and, each Foreign Subsidiary upon electing to do so may, become a Borrower or a Guarantor hereunder, and the Borrowers and the Guarantors shall complete all of the following steps in clauses (a) and (b) below within thirty (30) days (unless such time period is extended in writing by the Administrative Agent) after the date of organization or acquisition of (or in the case of a Foreign Subsidiary, election by) such Subsidiary: (a) cause such Person to sign and join in this Agreement or the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement by execution and delivery to the Administrative Agent of one or more counterparts of a Joinder hereto in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit 11.20(A) or Exhibit 11.20(B)   (each, as the case may be, a "Borrower Joinder" or "Guarantor Joinder"), appropriately dated, (b) deliver to the Administrative Agent all certificates and other documents referred to in Section 7 of this Agreement and such Borrower Joinder or Guarantor Joinder and (c) deliver to the Administrative Agent documents necessary to grant and perfect Prior Security Interests to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Banks in all Pledged Collateral held by the owners of such Subsidiary if it is a Foreign Subsidiary owned directly by a Domestic Loan Party. The Borrowers covenant and agree to cause all Domestic Material Subsidiaries to comply with the terms of this Section 11.20(i).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, each new Borrower shall not be permitted to borrow under this Agreement until the following number of Business Days has elapsed after a fully executed Borrower Joinder  
  
   141 

has been delivered to the Banks: (i) five (5) with respect to a Domestic Borrower and (ii) ten (10) with respect to a Foreign Borrower. 
  (ii)  The Borrowers agree that at all times on and after the Closing Date (a) the Borrowers and the Guarantors fully liable for the Obligations hereunder shall have directly accounted for not less than 80% of Consolidated EBITDA of TGI and its Subsidiaries and (b) the Domestic Loan Parties shall have directly accounted for not less than 95% of Consolidated EBITDA of TGI and its Domestic Subsidiaries for the four fiscal quarter period then last ended. 
  (iii)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the other Loan Documents, the obligations of each Foreign Borrower on account of principal and interest under the Loans and Reimbursement Obligations and Letters of Credit Borrowings shall be limited to the principal amount advanced directly to such Foreign Borrower or its Subsidiaries and reimbursement of draws under Letters of Credit issued for the account of such Foreign Borrower or its Subsidiaries and, in each case, interest and/or fees thereon. Each Foreign Borrower shall be liable only for its   pro     rata   share of all fees and expenses and other sums due hereunder (other than principal and interest on the Loans) based upon the ratio of Loans outstanding to, and Letters of Credit Outstanding for Letters of Credit issued for the account of, such Foreign Borrower or its Subsidiaries to the total amount of Loans outstanding and Letters of Credit Outstanding hereunder. 
  (iv)  Any Foreign Borrower may from time to time deliver a termination notice to the Administrative Agent requesting that it no longer be a party hereto. Such termination shall be effective two (2) Business Days after receipt by the Administrative Agent so long as all Obligations of such Foreign Borrower hereunder have been Paid In Full (including principal, interest and other amounts) and no Letter of Credit issued for the account or benefit of such Foreign Borrower or its Subsidiaries is outstanding;   provided     that,   to the extent this Agreement provides for the survival of certain provisions upon termination hereof, such surviving provisions shall survive a termination under this subsection with respect to any such Foreign Borrower. Following receipt of such notice, no further Loans may be borrowed by, or Letters of Credit issued for the account of, such Foreign Borrower or its Subsidiaries hereunder, unless such Foreign Borrower shall thereafter rejoin this Agreement as a Borrower pursuant to the joinder provisions of this Section 11.20. 
  (v)  For purposes of determining Loans outstanding for the benefit of a Foreign Borrower and its Subsidiaries, principal payments received hereunder shall be applied first to Obligations of Domestic Borrowers, unless (a) such payments are made directly by a Foreign Borrower (in which case such payments shall first be applied to Obligations of the Foreign Borrower making such payment) or (b) TGI designates at the time such payment is made that such payment is applicable to the Obligations of an identified Foreign Borrower and certifies that the funds for such payment were received from such Foreign Borrower. 
  (vi)  Subject to the limitation of liability of Foreign Borrowers as expressly set forth in this Section 11.20, all Obligations of the Borrowers and Guarantors  
  
   142 

are joint and several, except that no Foreign Guarantor shall have any liability with respect to any Obligation of a Domestic Loan Party. 
  (vii)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein no Bank shall be obligated to make a Loan to a Foreign Borrower if any Bank shall be prohibited under applicable Law or shall not be licensed to make Loans or extend credit to such Foreign Borrower; provided that if any such Bank is so prohibited, the Borrowers shall have the right to replace such Bank under Section 5.4.2 hereof.  Each Bank agrees to notify the Administrative Agent and TGI in writing promptly upon knowledge that it is so prohibited from making Loans or extending credit to any Foreign Borrower.   
  (viii)  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Foreign Subsidiary shall become a "Borrower" hereunder without the written consent of each Bank.  In addition to the foregoing, prior to any Foreign Subsidiary being a Borrower hereunder, (A) the Administrative Agent shall have received on behalf of the Banks such supporting resolutions, incumbency certificates, legal opinions and other documents or information, in form, content and scope reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, as may be required by the Administrative Agent or the Banks in their sole discretion, (B) the Banks shall have received satisfactory documentation and information required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including, without limitation, the USA Patriot Act, (C) each Bank shall have met all necessary regulatory and licensing requirements and internal policy requirements and shall be legally permitted to make loans in the jurisdiction in which such Foreign Borrower is organized and (D) lending to such Foreign Borrower will not cause any administrative or operational issues for any Bank. 
  11.21  USA Patriot Act. 
  Each Bank or assignee or participant of a Bank that is not incorporated under the Laws of the United States of America or a state thereof (and is not excepted from the certification requirement contained in Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations because it is both (i) an affiliate of a depository institution or foreign bank that maintains a physical presence in the United states or foreign county, and (ii) subject to supervision by a banking authority regulating such affiliated depository institution or foreign bank) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the certification, or, if applicable, recertification, certifying that such Bank is not a "shell" and certifying to other matters as required by Section 313 of the USA Patriot Act and the applicable regulations: (1) within 10 days after the Closing Date, and (2) as such other times as are required under the USA Patriot Act. 
  11.22  Collateral Agency Agreements, Etc. 
  The Administrative Agent is authorized and directed to enter into on behalf of the Banks the Collateral Agency Agreement and any future subordination agreements (pursuant to which the Banks will subordinate their Liens) with respect to Purchase Money Security Interest which are Permitted Liens and are permitted Indebtedness under Section 8.2.1(i)(g), and each of the Banks hereby approves and agrees to be bound by the terms of the Collateral Agency Agreement  
  
   143 

and any such subordination agreement which has been approved by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion. 
  11.23  Acknowledgement and Consent to Bail-In of EEA Financial Institutions 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any EEA Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the write-down and conversion powers of an EEA Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by: 
  (i)  the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by an EEA Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an EEA Financial Institution; and 
  (ii)  the effects of any Bail-in Action on any such liability, including, if applicable: 
  (a)  a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability; 
  (b)  a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such EEA Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or 
  (c)  the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the write-down and conversion powers of any EEA Resolution Authority. 
  11.24  Amendment and Restatement, Ratification, No Novation. 
  This Agreement amends and restates in its entirety the Original Credit Agreement, and the Loan Parties confirm that:  the Original Credit Agreement, the other Loan Documents and the Collateral for the Obligations thereunder (as all such capitalized terms are defined in the Original Credit Agreement) have at all times, since the date of the execution and delivery of such documents, remained in full force and effect and, where applicable, continue to guaranty and secure such obligations which are continued as the Obligations hereunder as amended hereby.  The Loans hereunder are a continuation of the Loans under (and as such term is defined in) the Original Credit Agreement.  The Loan Parties, the Administrative Agent, and the Banks acknowledge and agree that the amendment and restatement of the Original Credit Agreement and any Loan Documents expressly amended by this Agreement are not intended to constitute, nor do they constitute, a novation, interruption, suspension of continuity, satisfaction, discharge or termination of the obligations, loans, liabilities, or indebtedness under the Original Credit Agreement and other Loan Documents thereunder or the collateral security therefor, and this Agreement and the other Loan Documents are entitled to all rights and benefits originally pertaining to the Original Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents (as such term is  
  
   144 

defined therein).  The Loan Parties ratify and reaffirm the Intercompany Subordination Agreement, the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, the Collateral Agency Agreement and the other Loan Documents (and with respect to the Notes, as amended and restated in connection with this Agreement) executed and delivered in connection with the Original Credit Agreement, and agree that the terms thereof remain in full force and effect with respect to this Agreement, the Obligations and the Loan Documents notwithstanding any amendments to the Original Credit Agreement made by virtue of this Agreement. 

145 

EXHIBIT 1.1(P) 
  Pricing Grid 

(1) 
    All prices are expressed in basis points per annum; basis points in "Euro-Rate" and "Base Rate" rows represent margins added to those rates in computing the interest rate(s) payable on the Revolving Credit Loans. Pricing levels are determined quarterly on the basis of the Total Leverage Ratio set forth in the compliance certificates submitted under Section 8.3.3. which shall be on a pro forma basis to take into account acquisitions made during such quarter, as more specifically described in Section 8.2.6(ii) and the requirements set forth in the definition of Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA.  Changes in pricing levels will become effective on the date such compliance certificate is due to be delivered pursuant to Section 8.3.3, except that any changes in pricing levels relating to outstanding Borrowing Tranches of Loans in an Optional Currency shall be effective upon the expiration of the current Interest Period with respect to such Borrowing Tranches. 
              (2) 
    Pricing as of the Sixth Amendment Effective Date shall be set at Level V and remain at no less than Level V until the date upon which the compliance certificate for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2017 is delivered pursuant to Section 8.3.3. 
              (3) 
    If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of TGI or for any other reason, the Borrowers or the Banks determine that (i) the Total Leverage  

Ratio as calculated by the Borrowers as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of the Total Leverage Ratio would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrowers shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Banks, promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to any Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent, any Bank or the Administrative Agent, as Letter of Credit issuer), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of Administrative Agent, any Bank or the Administrative Agent, as Letter of Credit issuer, as the case may be, under Sections 2.8 [Letter of Credit Subfacility] or 4.4 [Interest After Default] or 9 [Default]. The Borrowers' obligations under this paragraph shall survive the termination of the Commitments and the repayments of all other Obligations hereunder. 
           (4)  
    Notwithstanding anything hereinabove in this Schedule to the contrary, if Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA is zero or negative, Level VI pricing shall apply. 
              (5) 
    Notwithstanding anything hereinabove in this Schedule to the contrary, if TGI and its Subsidiaries are at any time rated below Ba3/BB- or equivalent by both S P and Moody's, Level VI pricing shall apply until the time that such rating is upgraded to at least Ba3/BB- or equivalent by either agency. If the rating system of one of S P or Moody's shall change, or if one of such rating agencies shall cease to be in the business of rating corporate debt obligations, TGI and the Banks shall negotiate in good faith to amend this provision to reflect such changed rating system or the unavailability of ratings from such rating agency and, pending the effectiveness of any such amendment, the rating most recently in effect prior to such change or cessation shall apply.
