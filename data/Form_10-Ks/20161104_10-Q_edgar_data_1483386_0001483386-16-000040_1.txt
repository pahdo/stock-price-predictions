1. Organization  

The ETFS Precious Metals Basket Trust (the  Trust ) is an investment trust formed on October 18, 2010, under New York law pursuant to a depositary trust agreement (the  Trust Agreement ) executed by ETF Securities USA LLC (the  Sponsor ) and the Bank of New York Mellon (the  Trustee ) at the time of the Trust s organization. The Trust holds gold, silver, platinum and palladium in set ratios (together,  Bullion ) and issues ETFS Physical PM Basket Shares ( Shares ) (in minimum blocks of 50,000 Shares, also referred to as  Baskets ) in exchange for deposits of Bullion and distributes Bullion in connection with the redemption of Baskets. Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust which are issued by the Trust. The Sponsor is a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of ETF Securities Limited, a Jersey, Channel Islands based company. The Trust is governed by the Trust Agreement.  

The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold, silver, platinum and palladium, less the Trust s expenses and liabilities. The Trust is designed to provide an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a  Shareholder ) an opportunity to participate in the gold, silver, platinum and palladium markets through an investment in securities. The fiscal year end for the Trust is December 31.  

The accompanying financial statements were prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (     U.S. GAAP     ) for interim financial information and with the instructions for the Form 10-Q. In the opinion of management of the Sponsor, all adjustments (which consist of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position and results of operations as of and for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     and for all periods presented have been made.  

These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

2. Significant Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires those responsible for preparing financial statements to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.  

2.1 Basis of Accounting 

The Sponsor has determined that the Trust falls within the scope of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification (     ASC     )   946  ,    Financial Services Investment Companies  ,   and has concluded that for reporting purposes, the Trust is classified as an Investment Company.  The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. 

2.2.   Valuation of Bullion 

The Trust follows the provisions of ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements    (     ASC 820     ). ASC 820 provides guidance for determining fair value and requires increased disclosure regarding the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. 

Bullion is held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the  Custodian ), on behalf of the Trust, at its London, England vaulting premises on a segregated basis. The allocated platinum and palladium may also be held by UBS A.G., or any other firm selected by the Custodian to hold the Trust s platinum and palladium in the Trust s allocated account in the firm s Zurich, Switzerland vault premises on a segregated basis and whose appointment has been approved by the Sponsor (the  Zurich Sub-Custodian ).    At   September   30  , 2016, approximately   2  %   of the Trust s platinum and   2  %   of the Trust s palladium was held by the Zurich Sub-Custodian.  At   September   30  , 2016   no   gold or silver was held by the Zurich Sub-Custodian. 

The Trust s Bullion is recorded, per individual metal type, at fair value. The cost of Bullion is determined according to the average cost method and the fair value is based on the relevant  London Metal Price  for each metal held by the Trust.  Realized gains and losses on transfers of   Bullion  , or   Bullion   distributed for the redemption of Shares, are calculated on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and cost of   Bullion   transferred. 

Since March 20, 2015, the LBMA PM Gold Price is set using the afternoon session of the ICE Benchmark Administration ( IBA ) equilibrium auction, an electronic, tradable and auditable over-the-counter auction market with the ability to settle trades in US Dollars, Euros or British Pounds for LBMA authorized participating gold bullion banks or market makers ( gold participants ) that establishes a reference gold price for that day s trading. 

Prior to March 20, 2015, the fair value of gold was based on the London PM Fix. The London PM Fix price for gold was set using the afternoon session of the twice daily fix of the price of gold by five market making members of the London Bullion Market Association which occurred at approximately 3:00 PM London time, on each working day.   The London PM Fix was discontinued on March 19, 2015. 

The LME is responsible for the administration of the electronic platinum and palladium bullion price fixing system ( LMEbullion ) as well as providing electronic market clearing processes for platinum and palladium bullion transactions at the fixed prices established by the LME pricing mechanism. LMEbullion establishes and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of platinum and palladium twice each London trading day during fixing sessions beginning at 9:45 a.m. London time (the LME AM Fix) and 2:00 p.m. London time (the LME PM Fix). 

The CME Group, Inc. conducts an electronic, over-the-counter silver bullion auction in London, England to establish a fixing price for an ounce of silver once each trading day, which is disseminated by Thomson Reuters (the  London Silver Price ). The London Silver Price is established by the five LBMA authorized bullion banks and market makers participating in the auction.  The  London Metal Price  for silver held by the Trust is the London Silver Price.

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

2.2.   Valuation of Bullion (Continued) 

Once the value of Bullion has been determined, the net asset value (the  NAV ) is computed by the Trustee by deducting all accrued fees, expenses and other liabilities of the Trust, including the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the  Sponsor s Fee ), from the fair value of the Bullion and all other assets held by the Trust.   

The Trust recognizes changes in fair value of the investment in Bullion as   changes in unrealized gains or losses on investment in Bullion   through the Statement of Operations.  

The per Share amount of Bullion exchanged for a purchase or redemption is calculated daily by the Trustee, using the London Metal Price for each metal held by the Trust to calculate the Bullion amount in respect of any liabilities for which covering Bullion sales have not yet been made, and represents the per Share amount of Bullion held by the Trust, after giving effect to its liabilities, to cover expenses and liabilities and any losses that may have occurred.  

Fair Value Hierarchy 

ASC 820 establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The three levels of inputs are as follows: 

Level 1.  

Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Trust has the ability to access.  

Level 2.  

Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly. These inputs may include quoted prices for the identical instrument on an inactive market, prices for similar instruments and similar data.  

Level 3.  

Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability to the extent that relevant observable inputs are not available, representing the Trust s own assumptions about the assumptions that a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability, and that would be based on the best information available.  

To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in level 3. 

The inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls in its entirety is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 

The investment in Bullion is classified as a level 2 asset, as the   fair value of the   Trust s investment in Bullion is calculated   based upon   third party pricing sources supported by observable, verifiable inputs. 

The categorization of the Trust s assets is as shown below: 

There were   no   transfers between levels during the period ended   September 30, 2016   or the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

2.3. Bullion Receivable and Payable 

Bullion receivable or payable represents the quantity of Bullion covered by contractually binding orders for the creation or redemption of Shares respectively, where the Bullion has not yet been transferred to or from the Trust s account. Generally, ownership of the Bullion is transferred within three business days of the trade date.  

2.4.   Creations and Redemptions of Shares    

The Trust expects to create and redeem Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets (a Basket equals a block of   50,000   Shares). The Trust issues Shares in Baskets to Authorized Participants on an ongoing basis. Individual investors cannot purchase or redeem Shares in direct transactions with the Trust. An Authorized Participant is a person who (1) is registered as a broker-dealer or other securities market participant such as a bank or other financial institution which is not required to register as a broker-dealer to engage in securities transactions, (2) is a participant in The Depository Trust Company, (3) has entered into an Authorized Participant Agreement with the Trustee, and (4) has established an Authorized Participant Unallocated Account with the Trust s Custodian. An Authorized Participant Agreement is an agreement entered into by each Authorized Participant, the Sponsor and the Trustee which provides the procedures for the creation and redemption of Baskets and for the delivery of the Bullion required for such creations and redemptions. An Authorized Participant Unallocated Account is an unallocated Bullion account, either loco London or loco Zurich, established with the Custodian or a Bullion clearing bank by an Authorized Participant.  

The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of Bullion and any cash represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received.  

Authorized Participants may, on any business day, place an order with the Trustee to create or redeem one or more Baskets. The typical settlement period for Shares is three business days. In the event of a trade date at period end, where a settlement is pending, a respective account receivable and/or payable will be recorded. When Bullion is exchanged in settlement of redemption, it is considered a sale of Bullion for financial statement purposes.  

The amount of Bullion represented by the Baskets created or redeemed can only be settled to the nearest 1/1000th of an ounce. As a result, the value attributed to the creation or redemption of Shares may differ from the value of Bullion to be delivered or distributed by the Trust. In order to ensure that the correct metal is available at all times to back the Shares, the Sponsor accepts an adjustment to its management fees in the event of any shortfall or excess   on each transaction  . For each transaction, this amount is not more than 1/1000th of an ounce.  

As the Shares of the Trust are subject to redemption at the option of Authorized Participants, the Trust has classified the outstanding Shares as Net Assets.  Changes in Shares are presented in the Statement of Changes in Net Assets.  

2.5.   Income Taxes 

The Trust is classified as a  grantor trust  for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax. Instead, the Trust s income and expenses will  flow through  to the Shareholders, and the Trustee will report the Trust s proceeds, income, deductions, gains, and losses to the Internal Revenue Service on that basis.  

The Sponsor has evaluated whether or not there are uncertain tax positions that require financial statement recognition and has determined that   no   reserves for uncertain tax positions are required as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

2. Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) 

2.7.   Expenses /   Realized Gains / Losses 

The primary expense of the Trust is the Sponsor s Fee, which is paid by the Trust through in-kind transfers of Bullion to the Sponsor.  

The Trust will transfer Bullion to the Sponsor to pay the Sponsor s Fee that will accrue daily at an annualized rate equal to   0.60  % of the adjusted net asset value (the  ANAV ) of the Trust, paid monthly in arrears.  

The Sponsor has agreed to assume administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust, including the Trustee s monthly fee and out of pocket expenses, the Custodian s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian s expenses, exchange listing fees, United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and certain legal expenses.  

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     the Sponsor s Fee was $  379,826     and $  211,594  , respectively.   For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   the Sponsor s Fee was   $894,907   and   $714,191  , respectively. 

At   September 30, 2016     and at   December 31, 2015  , the fees payable to the Sponsor were   $  132,872   and $  80,206  , respectively. 

With respect to expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor, the Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s Bullion as necessary to pay these expenses. When selling Bullion to pay expenses, the Trustee will endeavor to sell the smallest amounts of Bullion needed to pay these expenses in order to minimize the Trust s holdings of assets other than Bullion.    Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had   no   expenses during the     three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   and the   nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  . 

Unless otherwise directed by the Sponsor, when selling Bullion the Trustee will endeavor to sell at the price established by the London Metal Price for each metal held by the Trust. The Trustee will place orders with dealers (which may include the Custodian) through which the Trustee expects to receive the most favorable price and execution of orders. The Custodian may be the purchaser of such Bullion only if the sale transaction is made at the London Metal Price for each metal held by the Trust used by the Trustee to value the Trust s Bullion. A gain or loss is recognized based on the difference between the selling price and the cost of the Bullion sold. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor is liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of any sale. 

Realized gains and losses result from the transfer of   Bullion   for Share redemptions and / or to pay expenses and are recognized on a trade date basis as the difference between the fair value and cost of   Bullion   transferred. 

2.8.   Subsequent Events 

In accordance with the provisions set forth in FASB ASC 855-10,   Subsequent Events  , the Trust s management has evaluated the possibility of subsequent events   impacting   the Trust s financial statements through the filing date.  During this period, no material subsequent events requiring adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements were identified. 

11   

ETFS PRECIOUS METALS BASKET TRUST 

Notes to the Financial Stat  e  ments 

3. Related Parties  

The Sponsor and the Trustee are considered to be related parties to the Trust. The Trustee s and Custodian s fees are paid by the Sponsor and are not separate expenses of the Trust. The Trustee and the Custodian and their affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants and purchase or sell Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  In addition the Trustee and the Custodian and their affiliates may from time to time purchase or sell Bullion directly, for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion.  

4. Concentration of Risk  

The Trust s sole business activity is the investment in Bullion, and substantially all the Trust s assets are holdings of Bullion which creates a concentration risk associated with fluctuations in the price of Bullion. Several factors could affect the price of Bullion, including: (i) global Bullion supply and demand, which is influenced by factors such as general changes in economic conditions, such as a recession or other economic downturn, recycling, autocatalyst demand, industrial demand, jewelry demand and investment demand, central bank purchases and sales, and production and cost levels in major Bullion-producing countries; (ii) investors  expectations with respect to the rate of inflation; (iii) currency exchange rates; (iv) interest rates; (v) investment and trading activities of hedge funds and commodity funds; and (vi) global or regional political, economic or financial events and situations. In addition, there is no assurance that Bullion will maintain its long-term value in terms of purchasing power in the future. In the event that the price of Bullion declines, the Sponsor expects the value of an investment in the Shares to decline proportionately. Each of these events could have a material effect on the Trust s financial position and results of operations.  

5. Indemnification  

Under the Trust s organizational documents, the Trustee (and its directors, employees and agents) and the Sponsor (and its members, managers, directors, officers, employees and affiliates) are indemnified by the Trust against any liability, cost or expense it incurs without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part and without reckless disregard on its part of its obligations and duties under the Trust s organizational documents. The Trust s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have not yet occurred.

Introduction 

The Trust is a common law trust, formed under the laws of the state of New York on October 18, 2010. The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. It does not have any officers, directors, or employees and is administered by the Trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. It will not hold or trade in commodity futures contracts, nor is it a commodity pool, or subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading adviser in connection with issuing Shares.  

The Trust holds Bullion (consisting of gold, silver, platinum and palladium in specified proportions) and is expected to issue Baskets in exchange for deposits of Bullion, and to distribute Bullion in connection with redemptions of Baskets. Shares issued by the Trust represent units of undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of gold, silver, platinum and palladium in the proportions held by the Trust, less the Trust s expenses. The Trust holds Bullion in a ratio such that for every 0.03 ounces of gold, it holds 1.1 ounces of silver, 0.004 ounces of platinum and 0.006 ounces of palladium. The Sponsor believes that, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost effective investment relative to traditional means of investing in Bullion.  

The Trust issues and redeems Shares only with Authorized Participants in exchange for Bullion   and   only in aggregations of 50,000 or integral multiples thereof. A list of current Authorized Participants is available from the Sponsor or the Trustee. Shares of the Trust trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the  NYSE ) Arca under the symbol  GLTR .  

Valuation of Bullion and Computation of Net Asset Value 

On each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such day ( Evaluation Time ), the Trustee will evaluate the Bullion held by the Trust and determine both the ANAV and the NAV of the Trust. 

At the Evaluation Time, the Trustee will value the Trust s Bullion on the basis of that day s London Metal Price for such metal or, if no London Metal Price is made for a metal on such day or has not been announced by the Evaluation Time, the next most recent London Metal Price announced for such metal determined prior to the Evaluation Time will be used, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor determines that the applicable London Metal Price or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly represents the commercial value of the Trust s Bullion is not an appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust s Bullion, it shall identify an alternative basis for such evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor shall be liable to any person for the determination that the London Metal Price or such other publicly available price is not appropriate as a basis for evaluation of the Trust s Bullion or for any determination as to the alternative basis for such evaluation provided that such determination is made in good faith.  

Once the value of the Bullion has been determined, the Trustee will subtract all estimated accrued but unpaid fees (other than the fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes place computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets), expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the Bullion and all other assets of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trust s reserve account, if established). The resulting figure is the ANAV of the Trust. The ANAV of the Trust is used to compute the Sponsor s Fee. 

All fees accruing for the day on which the valuation takes place computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets shall be calculated using the ANAV calculated for such day on which the valuation takes place. The Trustee shall subtract from the ANAV the amount of accrued fees so computed for such day and the resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee will also determine the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of the Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes the net number of any Shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day).

The Quarter Ended   September 30, 2016 

The NAV of the Trust is obtained by subtracting the Trust s liabilities on any day from the value of the Bullion owned and receivable by the Trust on that day; the NAV per Share is obtained by dividing the NAV of the Trust on a given day by the number of Shares outstanding on that day.  

The Trust s NAV   increase  d   from $  208,258,032   at   June 30, 2016   to   $  278,003,094   at   September 30, 2016  , a   33.49%     increase   for the quarter. The   increase     in the Trust s NAV resulted primarily from     a  n     increase   in outstanding Shares, which   rose   from   3,200,000   Shares   at   June 30, 2016   to   4,150,000   shares at   September 30, 2016  ,   a result of   950,000   Shares (  19   Basket  s  ) being created  . No   Shares   were   redeemed during the quarter. 

There was also    a  n     increase   in the price per ounce of gold, silver, platinum and palladium in the proportions held by the Trust (the  Proportionate Price ), which   rose     3.09%   during the quart  er. 

NAV per Share   increased     2.93%   from $  65.08   at   June 30, 2016   to   $  66.99   at   September 30, 2016  . The Trust s NAV per Share   rose     slightly   less     than the Proportionate Price on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s Fee, which was   $  379,826   for the quarter, or 0.60% of the Trust s   ANAV   on an annualized basis. 

NAV per Share of $  70.23   at   August 2, 2016   was the highest during the quarter, compared with a low of $  65.61   at   September 1, 2016  . 

The   increase   in net assets from operations for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   was $  4,834,605  , resulting from   a change in unrealized   gain   on investment in Bullion of   $5,189,505     and   a realized   gain   of $  24,926   on the transfer of Bullion to pay expenses  ,    offset by   the Sponsor s Fee of $  379,826  . Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .

The   increase     in the Trust s NAV resulted primarily from   an   increase   in outstanding Shares, which   rose   from   3,100,000   Shares   at   December 31, 2015   to   4,150,000   shares at   September 30, 2016  ,   a result of   1,450,000   Shares (  29   Basket  s  ) being created and   400,000   Shares (  8   Baskets) being redeemed during the period   and   an   increase   in   the Proportionate Price  , which   rose     28.95%   during the period  . 

NAV per Share   increased     28.38%   from   $52.18   at   December 31, 2015   to   $66.99   at   September 30, 2016  . The Trust s NAV per Share   rose     slightly   less     than the Proportionate Price on a percentage basis due to the Sponsor s Fee, which was   $894,907   for the period  , or 0.60% of the Trust s ANAV on an annualized basis. 

NAV per Share of   $70.23   at   August 2, 2016   was the highest during the   period  , compared with a low of   $52.35   at   January 12, 2016  . 

The   increase   in net assets from operations for the   period   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $42,015,014  , resulting from a change in unrealized   gain   on investment in Bullion of   $45,633,664   offset by a realized   loss   of   $3,053   on the transfer of Bullion to pay expenses, a realized   loss   of   $2,720,690   on Bullion distributed for the redemption of Shares, and the Sponsor s Fee of   $894,907  . Other than the Sponsor s Fee, the Trust had no expenses during the   period   ended   September 30, 2016  .

Liquidity   Capital Resources 

The Trust is not aware of any trends, demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in material changes to its liquidity needs. In exchange for the Sponsor s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume most of the expenses incurred by the Trust. As a result, the only ordinary expense of the Trust during the period covered by this report was the Sponsor s Fee.  

The Trustee will, at the direction of the Sponsor or in its own discretion, sell the Trust s Bullion, only in the specified proportion of gold, silver, platinum and palladium held by the Trust, as necessary to pay the Trust s expenses not otherwise assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee will not sell Bullion to pay the Sponsor s Fee but will pay the Sponsor s Fee through in-kind transfers of Bullion to the   Sponsor. At   September 30, 2016   the Trus  t did not have any cash balances.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

The Trust has no off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Critical Accounting Policies 

The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements relies on estimates and assumptions that impact the Trust s financial position and results of operations. These estimates and assumptions affect the Trust s application of accounting policies.     In addition, please refer to Note 2 to the financial statements for further discussion of accounting policies.
