  Note A--Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results for the   six  -month period ended   October 31, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   April 30, 2017  .  The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   April 30, 2016   filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).     

Note B--New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in  Accounting Standard Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition  and most industry-specific guidance. The standard requires that entities recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  In August 2015, the  FASB issued  ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date.   ASU 2015-14  defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that period.  The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2014-09 and ASU 2015-14 will have on its financial position and results of operations. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  Among other things, ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize most leases on-balance sheet, which will increase reported assets and liabilities. Lessor accounting remains substantially similar to current U.S. GAAP. ASU 2016-02 supersedes  Topic 840 - Leases.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shares-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU 2016-09 is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB s simplification initiative. ASU 2016-09 changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) accounting for income taxes; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows; (3) forfeitures; (4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; and (5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years for public companies.  The Company early adopted this standard as of May 1, 2016. As a result, during the first half of fiscal 2017, it recognized the excess tax benefit of   $1.2 million   as income tax expense on the condensed consolidated statements of income (adopted prospectively). The adoption did not impact the existing classification of the awards. Excess tax benefits from stock based compensation is now classified in net income in the statement of cash flows instead of being separately stated in financing activities for the six months ended October 31, 2016 (adopted prospectively). Additionally, the Company reclassified   $2.6 million   of employee withholding taxes paid from operating activities into financing activities in the statement of cash flows for the six month period ended October 31, 2015, as required by ASU 2016-09 (adopted retrospectively).  Following the adoption of the new standard, the Company elected to continue estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited and adjust its estimate on an ongoing basis. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The Company retrospectively adopted this standard on April 30, 2016, which resulted in the reclassification of approximately   $0.3 million   of debt issuance costs from other assets to long-term debt as of April 30, 2016.  Adoption of the new guidance did not impact the Company's shareholder's equity, results of operations or statements of cash flows.

Note C--Net Earnings Per Share 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net earnings per share: 

The Company repurchased a total of   67,400   and   78,232   shares of its common stock during the three-month periods ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   139,800   and   108,787   shares of its common stock during the six-month periods ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  There were   no   potentially dilutive securities for the three- and   six  -month periods ended   October 31, 2016   and 2015, which were excluded from the calculation of net earnings per diluted share.  

Note D--Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company has various stock-based compensation plans.  During the quarter ended October 31, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved grants of a total of   5,880   service-based restricted stock units ( RSUs ) to non-employee directors. The service-based RSUs vest daily through the end of the two-year vesting period as long as the recipient continuously remains a member of the Board, and entitle the recipient to receive one share of the Company's common stock per unit granted. During the   six  -months ended   October 31, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the Company also approved grants of service-based RSUs and performance-based RSUs to key employees.  The employee performance-based RSUs totaled   36,058   units and the employee service-based RSUs totaled   19,442   units. The performance-based RSUs entitle the recipients to receive   one   share of the Company s common stock per unit granted if applicable performance conditions are met and the recipient remains continuously employed with the Company until the units vest.  The service-based RSUs entitle the recipients to receive   one   share of the Company s common stock per unit granted if they remain continuously employed with the Company until the units vest.  All of the Company s RSUs granted to employees cliff-vest   three   years from the grant date.  
    
  For the three- and   six  -month periods ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  , stock-based compensation expense was allocated as follows:  

8 

During the   six   months ended   October 31, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the Company also approved grants of   5,136   cash-settled performance-based restricted stock tracking units ("RSTUs") and   2,804   cash-settled service-based RSTUs for more junior level employees.  Each performance-based RSTU entitles the recipient to receive a payment in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock as of the payment date if applicable performance conditions are met and the recipient remains continuously employed with the Company until the units vest.  The service-based RSTUs entitle the recipients to receive a payment in cash equal to the fair market value of a share of the Company's common stock as of the payment date if they remain continuously employed with the Company until the units vest.  All of the RSTUs cliff-vest   three   years from the grant date.  Since the RSTUs will be settled in cash, the grant date fair value of these awards is recorded as a liability until the date of payment.  The fair value of each cash-settled RSTU award is remeasured at the end of each reporting period and the liability is adjusted, and related expense recorded, based on the new fair value.  The Company recognized expense of $  152 thousand   and $  220 thousand   for the three-month periods ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $203 thousand   and   $501 thousand   for the six month periods ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to RSTUs.  A liability for payment of the RSTUs is included in the Company's balance sheets in the amount of $  0.9 million   and $  1.2 million   as of   October 31, 2016   and   April 30, 2016  , respectively. 

Note E--Customer Receivables 
    
  The components of customer receivables were:  

Note F--Inventories 
    
  The components of inventories were:  

Interim LIFO calculations are based on management s estimates of expected year-end inventory levels and costs.  Since these items are estimated, interim results are subject to the final year-end LIFO inventory valuation. 

Note G--Product Warranty 
    
  The Company estimates outstanding warranty costs based on the historical relationship between warranty claims and revenues.  The warranty accrual is reviewed monthly to verify that it properly reflects the remaining obligation based on the anticipated expenditures over the balance of the obligation period.  Adjustments are made when actual warranty claim experience differs from estimates.  Warranty claims are generally made within   two months   of the original shipment date.

The following is a reconciliation of the Company s warranty liability, which is included in other accrued expenses on the balance sheet:  

Note H--Cash Flow 
    
  Supplemental disclosures of cash flow information: 

Note I--Pension Benefits 
    
  Effective April 30, 2012, the Company froze all future benefit accruals under the Company s hourly and salary defined-benefit pension plans. 
    
  Net periodic pension (benefit) cost consisted of the following for the three- and   six  -month periods ended   October 31, 2016   and   2015  :  

The Company expects to contribute a total of   $27.3 million   to its pension plans in fiscal 2017, which represents both required and discretionary funding.  Of that amount, as of   October 31, 2016  ,   $10.5 million   of contributions had been made.  On August 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved up to   $20 million   of discretionary funding which is included in the total expected contributions for the year.  The Company made contributions of   $5.0 million   to its pension plans in fiscal 2016.  

Note J--Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The Company utilizes the hierarchy of fair value measurements to classify certain of its assets and liabilities based upon the following definitions: 
  
   10 

Level 1- Investments with quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The Company s Level 1 investments include money market funds, mutual funds and certificates of deposit. The Company s mutual fund investment assets represent contributions made and invested on behalf of the Company s executive officers in a supplementary employee retirement plan. 
    
  Level 2- Investments with observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as: quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. The Company has no Level 2 assets or liabilities. 
    
  Level 3- Investments with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The Company has no Level 3 assets or liabilities. 
    
  The following table summarizes the fair values of assets that are recorded in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of   October 31, 2016   and   April 30, 2016   at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):   

Note K--Loans Payable and Long-Term Debt 
    
  The Company's outstanding indebtedness and other obligations to Wells Fargo are unsecured.  Under the terms of its revolving credit facility, the Company must (1) maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of not greater than   1.4   to 1.0; (2) maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of not less than   1.5   to 1.0 measured on a rolling four-quarter basis; and (3) comply with other customary affirmative and negative covenants.  The Company was in compliance with all covenants specified in the credit facility as of   October 31, 2016  , including as follows: (1) the Company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at   October 31, 2016   was   0.6   to 1.0; and (2) the Company's ratio of cash flow to fixed charges for its most recent four quarters was   4.8   to 1.0. 

Note L--Income Taxes 
    
  The Company s effective income tax rate for the   three and six   month periods ended   October 31, 2016   were   38.0%   and   34.9%  , respectively, compared with   36.3%   and   36.2%  , respectively, in the comparable periods of the prior fiscal year.  The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was negatively impacted by a reduction in the domestic production deduction benefit due to planned additional pension contributions.  The effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2017 as compared to the first half of fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted by a   $1.2 million   tax benefit related to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation. 

Note M--Other Information 
    
  The Company is involved in suits and claims in the normal course of business, including without limitation product liability and general liability claims, and claims pending before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  On at least a  
  
   11 

quarterly basis, the Company consults with its legal counsel to ascertain the reasonable likelihood that such claims may result in a loss.  As required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic 450,  Contingencies  (ASC 450), the Company categorizes the various suits and claims into three categories according to their likelihood for resulting in potential loss: those that are probable, those that are reasonably possible, and those that are deemed to be remote.  Where losses are deemed to be probable and estimable, accruals are made. Where losses are deemed to be reasonably possible, a range of loss estimates is determined and considered for disclosure.  In determining these loss range estimates, the Company considers known values of similar claims and consults with independent counsel. 
    
  The Company believes that the aggregate range of loss stemming from the various suits and asserted and unasserted claims that were deemed to be either probable or reasonably possible was not material as of   October 31, 2016  . 

Item 2. 
  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
  and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, both of which are included in Part I, Item 1 of this report.  The Company s critical accounting policies are included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. 

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This report contains statements concerning the Company s expectations, plans, objectives, future financial performance, and other statements that are not historical facts.  These statements may be  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  In most cases, the reader can identify forward-looking statements by words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   forecast,   expect,   believe,   should,   could,   would,   plan,   may,   intend,   estimate,   prospect,   goal,   will,   predict,   potential  or other similar words.  Forward-looking statements contained in this report, including elsewhere in  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  are based on current expectations and our actual results may differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.  In addition, the Company participates in an industry that is subject to rapidly changing conditions and there are numerous factors that could cause the Company to experience a decline in sales and/or earnings or deterioration in financial condition.  Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements made in this report include but are not limited to: 

general economic or business conditions and instability in the financial and credit markets, including their potential impact on the Company's (i) sales and operating costs and access to financing, and (ii) customers and suppliers and their ability to obtain financing or generate the cash necessary to conduct their respective businesses; 
                
    the volatility in mortgage rates and unemployment rates; 
                
    slower growth in personal income and residential investment; 
                
    the cyclical nature of the Company s industry, which is particularly sensitive to changes in consumer confidence, the amount of consumers  income available for discretionary purchases, and the availability and terms of consumer credit; 
                
    economic weakness in a specific channel of distribution; 
                
    the loss of sales from specific customers due to their loss of market share, bankruptcy or switching to a competitor; 
                
    risks associated with domestic manufacturing operations and suppliers, including fluctuations in capacity utilization and the prices and availability of key raw materials as well as fuel, transportation, warehousing and labor costs and environmental compliance and remediation costs; 
                
    the need to respond to price or product initiatives launched by a competitor; 
                
    the ability to retain and motivate Company employees; 
                
    the Company s ability to successfully implement initiatives related to increasing market share, new products, maintaining and increasing its sales force and new product displays; and 
                
    sales growth at a rate that outpaces the Company s ability to install new manufacturing capacity or a sales decline that requires reduction or realignment of the Company s manufacturing capacity.  
       
  Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements is contained in this report, including elsewhere in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and also in the Company's most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, filed with the SEC, including under Item 1A, "Risk Factors," Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,  and Item 7A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk."  While the Company believes that these risks are manageable and will not adversely impact the long-term performance  
  
   12 

of the Company, these risks could, under certain circumstances, have a material adverse impact on its operating results and financial condition. 
    
  Any forward-looking statement that the Company makes speaks only as of the date of this report.  The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements or cautionary factors, as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. 

Overview 
    
  American Woodmark Corporation manufactures and distributes kitchen cabinets and vanities for the remodeling and new home construction markets.  Its products are sold on a national basis directly to home centers, major builders and home manufacturers, and through a network of independent dealers and distributors.  At   October 31, 2016  , the Company operated nine manufacturing facilities and seven service centers across the country. 
    
  The three-month period ended   October 31, 2016   was the Company s   second   quarter of its fiscal year that ends on April 30, 2017 ( fiscal 2017 ).  During the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company continued to experience improving market conditions from the housing market downturn that began in 2007. 
    
  The Company s remodeling-based business was impacted by the following trends during the   second   quarter of the Company s fiscal 2017:     

Residential investment as a percentage of gross domestic product as tracked by the U.S. Department of Commerce for the third calendar quarter of 2016 remained unchanged at 3.5% from the same period in the prior year; 
                
    The median price per existing home sold improved from the same period one year ago by 5.19% according to data provided by the National Association of Realtors, and existing home sales fell 0.37% during the third calendar quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year;  
                
    The unemployment rate improved to 4.9% as of October 2016 compared to 5.0% as of October 2015 according to data provided by the U.S. Department of Labor;  
                
    Mortgage interest rates remained low with a thirty-year fixed mortgage rate of approximately 3.47% in October 2016, a decrease of  approximately 33 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year; and 
        
  The Company believes there is no single indicator that directly correlates with cabinet remodeling market activity. For this reason, the Company considers other factors in addition to those discussed above as indicators of overall market activity including credit availability, housing affordability and sales reported by the Kitchen Cabinet Manufacturers Association ( KCMA ), a trade organization that issues the aggregate sales that have been reported by its members including the largest cabinet manufacturers in the United States.  Based on the totality of factors listed above, the Company believes that the cabinet remodeling market increased in the low single digits during the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017.  
    
  The Company s largest remodeling customers and competitors continued to utilize sales promotions in the Company s product category to boost sales and some competitors accelerated their promotional activity.  These promotions consisted of free products and/or cash discounts to consumers based upon the amount or type of cabinets they purchased.  The Company strives to maintain its promotional levels in line with market activity, with a goal of remaining competitive.  The Company experienced promotional levels during the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017 that were higher than those experienced in the same period of the prior year.  
    
  The Company s remodeling sales decreased 9% during the   second   quarter and 3% during the first half of fiscal 2017 compared with the same prior-year periods.  Our Waypoint brand, which serves the dealer channel, represented approximately 10% of our overall sales and grew by approximately 9% during the second quarter and more than 10% during the first half of fiscal 2017, respectively, when compared to the comparable prior-year period.  Management believes that the Company has improved market share within the dealer channel while it has lost some share within big box retailers.  The Company believes the share loss within the big box retailers is due to competitive promotional activity. 
    
  Regarding new construction markets, the Company believes that fluctuations in single-family housing starts are the best indicator of cabinet activity.  Assuming a sixty to ninety day lag between housing starts and the installation of cabinetry, single-family housing starts rose approximately 4% during the   second   quarter of the Company s fiscal 2017 over the comparable prior year period.  

13 

Sales in the new construction channel increased 15% in the   second   quarter and more than 17% during the first half of fiscal 2017 when compared with the same periods of fiscal 2016.  The Company believes it continued to over index the market both due to share penetration with our builder partners as well as the health of the markets where we concentrate our business.  
    
  The Company s total net sales rose 3% during the   second   quarter and 7%     during the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the same prior-year periods,     which management believes was driven primarily by a rise in overall market activity. 
     
  As of   October 31, 2016  , the Company had total net deferred tax assets of $20.8 million, down from $32.6 million at April 30, 2016.  The Company regularly considers the need for a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, after considering all positive and negative evidence, it is determined that it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.  The Company has recorded a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets for certain state investment tax credit ( ITC ) carryforwards.  These credits expire in various years beginning in fiscal 2020.  The Company believes based on positive evidence of the housing industry improvement along with four consecutive years of profitability that the Company will more likely than not realize all other remaining deferred tax assets. 
    
  The Company earned net income of $17.6 million for the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with $18.2 million in the   second   quarter of its prior fiscal year, and earned net income of $39.3 million for the first half of fiscal 2017, compared with $33.3 million in the same period of the prior year.     

Results of Operations    

Net Sales.   Net sales were $264.1 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, an increase of 3% compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2016.  For the first   six   months of fiscal 2017, net sales were   $522.2 million  , reflecting a   7%   increase compared with the same period of fiscal 2016.  Overall unit volume for the three- and   six  -month periods ended   October 31, 2016   improved by 2% and 6%, respectively.  Average revenue per unit increased 1% during the three- and   six  -month periods ended   October 31, 2016  , driven by improvements in the Company s sales mix. 
    
  Gross     Profit.    Gross profit margin for the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017 was 21.3%, compared with 21.9% for the same period of fiscal 2016.  Gross profit margin was 22.1% for the first half of fiscal 2017, compared with 21.8% in the first half of fiscal 2016.  Gross profit in the second quarter was negatively impacted by higher labor benefit costs and depreciation costs.  Gross profit for the first six months of the current fiscal year was favorably impacted by higher sales volume, lower labor benefit costs and improved operating efficiency.     
     
  Selling and     Marketing Expenses  .        Selling and marketing expenses were 6.5% of net sales in the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017 and 2016.  For the first six months of fiscal 2017, selling and marketing expenses were 6.4% of net sales, compared with 6.7% of net sales for the same period of fiscal 2016.  Selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales remained unchanged during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 as additional product launch costs in the quarter were offset by lower commissions.  The decrease in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales during the first half of fiscal 2017 is due to favorable leverage through expense management.  
    
  General and     Administrative Expenses.      General and administrative expenses were 4.0% of net sales in the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017, compared with 4.2% of net sales in the   second   quarter of fiscal 2016, and 4.1% of net sales in the first half of fiscal 2017 compared with 4.4% of net sales in the same period in fiscal 2016.  The decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales during the   second   quarter and first half of fiscal 2017 is due to favorable leverage from increased sales, lower pay for performance compensation costs and ongoing expense control.  

14 

Effective Income Tax Rates.        The Company s effective income tax rate for the three- and   six  -month periods ended   October 31, 2016   was 38.0% and 34.9%, respectively, compared with 36.3% and 36.2%, respectively, in the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.  The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2017 was negatively impacted by a reduction in the domestic production deduction benefit due to planned additional pension contributions.  The effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2017 as compared to the first half of fiscal 2016 was favorably impacted by a   $1.2 million   tax benefit related to the early adoption of ASU 2016-09, the new accounting guidance relating to stock-based compensation. 
    
  Outlook.    The Company believes that the average price of existing home sales will continue to increase driven by growth in both employment and growth in new household formation.  In this environment, the Company expects the cabinet remodeling market will show modest improvement during the remainder of fiscal 2017 but overall activity will continue to be below historical averages.  Within the cabinet remodeling market, the Company expects independent dealers to outperform other channels of distribution primarily due to their more affluent customer base.  As a result, the Company expects its remodeling sales for the remainder of fiscal 2017 to exceed the market rate.  The Company expects to increase its market share in the home center channel versus the first half of fiscal 2017 through using a competitive promotional strategy that restores market parity and to increase share in the dealer channel.   
    
  The Company expects that single-family housing starts and in turn, new construction cabinet sales, will grow approximately 10% during the remainder of its fiscal year 2017, and that the Company s new construction sales growth will continue to exceed this level for the remainder of its current fiscal year, but at a lower rate than fiscal 2016, as comparable prior year sales levels become more challenging.  
    
  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  The Company s cash and cash equivalents totaled   $155.6 million   at   October 31, 2016  , representing an $18.8 million decrease from its April 30, 2016 levels.  At   October 31, 2016  , total long-term debt (including current maturities) was $25.5 million, an increase of $1.8 million from its balance at April 30, 2016.  The Company s ratio of long-term debt to total capital was 7.0% at   October 31, 2016  , compared with 7.3% at April 30, 2016. 
    
  The Company s main sources of liquidity are its existing cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from its operating activities. The Company can borrow up to $35 million under its revolving credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ( Wells Fargo ).  At   October 31, 2016  , $10 million of loans and $4.5 million of letters of credit were outstanding under the facility, and the Company had additional borrowing base availability of $25.0 million.  
    
  The Company's outstanding indebtedness and other obligations to Wells Fargo are unsecured.  Under the terms of its revolving credit facility, the Company must: (1) maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth of not greater than 1.4 to 1.0; (2) maintain at the end of each fiscal quarter a ratio of cash flow to fixed charges of not less than 1.5 to 1.0 measured on a rolling four-quarter basis; and (3) comply with other customary affirmative and negative covenants.  The Company was in compliance with all covenants specified in the credit facility as of   October 31, 2016  , including as follows: (1) the Company s ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth at   October 31, 2016   was 0.6 to 1.0; and (2) cash flow to fixed charges for its most recent four quarters was 4.8 to 1.0. 
    
  The revolving credit facility does not limit the Company s ability to pay dividends or repurchase its common shares as long as the Company is in compliance with these covenants.  
    
  Cash provided by operating activities in the first   six   months of fiscal 2017 was $  40.1 million  , compared with $  42.0 million   in the comparable period of fiscal 2016.  The decrease in the Company s cash from operating activities was driven primarily by lower increases in accounts payables and accrued expenses which was partially offset by lower increases in customer receivables and higher operating profitability. 
    
  The Company s investing activities primarily consist of purchases and maturities of certificates of deposit, investment in property, plant and equipment and promotional displays.  Net cash used for investing activities was $50.4 million in the first   six   months of fiscal 2017, compared with $25.8 million in the comparable period of fiscal 2016. The increase in cash used was driven by a $36.5 million increased investment in certificates of deposit, offset by a $10.8 million decrease in outflows for investment in property, plant and equipment.  
    
  During the first   six   months of fiscal 2017, net cash used by financing activities was $8.5 million, compared with $0.8 million in the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.  The increase in cash used was driven by the Company s receipt of $2.2 million during the current fiscal year from employees  exercise of stock options compared to $6.0 million in the same period of the  
  
   15 

prior year, as well as stock repurchases of $10.4 million during the first   six   months of fiscal 2017 compared to $7.0 million in the same period of the prior year.   
    
  On November 20, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized repurchases of up to $25 million of the Company's common shares.  On November 19, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $20 million of the Company's common shares.  This authorization is in addition to the stock repurchase program authorized on November 20, 2014.  Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, or through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, at prices and on terms the Company deems appropriate and subject to the Company's cash requirements for other purposes, compliance with the covenants under the Company s revolving credit facility, and other factors management deems relevant. At   October 31, 2016  , $18.0 million remained authorized by the Company s Board of Directors to repurchase the Company s common shares.  The Company purchased a total of 139,800 common shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $10.4 million, during the first   six   months of fiscal 2017, under the authorizations. The Company continues to evaluate its cash on hand and prospects for future cash generation, and compare these against its plans for future capital expenditures. Although the evaluation of its future capital expenditures is ongoing, the Company expects that it will make repurchases of its common shares from time to time during the remainder of the fiscal year, subject to the Company s financial condition, capital requirements, results of operations and any other factors then deemed relevant.  See Part II. Item 2, "Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds" for further information on share repurchases, including a discussion of the authorization of an additional stock repurchase program of up to an additional $50 million by the Company's Board of Directors on November 30, 2016.  
    
  On August 25, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved up to $20 million of discretionary funding to reduce its defined benefit pension liabilities.  At October 31, 2016, $12.0 million of discretionary funding remained authorized by the Company's Board of Directors to reduce its defined benefit pension liabilities.  The Company made contributions of $8.0 million of discretionary funding during the first six months of fiscal 2017. 
    
  On November 30, 2016 the Board of Directors of the Company approved a new corporate headquarters in Winchester, Virginia.  The new space will consolidate employees that currently occupy four buildings in Winchester, Virginia and Frederick County, Virginia, in early 2018.  It is expected that the new building will be self-funded for approximately $30 million. 
    
  Cash flow from operations combined with accumulated cash and cash equivalents on hand are expected to be more than sufficient to support forecasted working capital requirements, service existing debt obligations and fund capital expenditures for the remainder of fiscal 2017. 

Seasonal and Inflationary Factors 
    
  The Company s business has historically been subject to seasonal influences, with higher sales typically realized in the second and fourth fiscal quarters. 
    
  The costs of the Company s products are subject to inflationary pressures and commodity price fluctuations.  The Company has generally been able over time to recover the effects of inflation and commodity price fluctuations through sales price increases. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  There have been no significant changes to the Company s critical accounting policies as disclosed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. 

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Since the end of the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, the Company has had no material exposure to changes in interest rates for its debt agreements. 
    
  The Company does not currently use commodity or interest rate derivatives or similar financial instruments to manage its commodity price or interest rate risks.  See  Seasonal and Inflationary Factors  in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above for additional information regarding the effects inflation and commodity price fluctuations have on the costs of the Company s products.  

16 

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures 
    
  Senior management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of   October 31, 2016  .  Based on this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective.  In addition, there has been no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   October 31, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.   Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is involved in various suits and claims in the normal course of business all of which constitute ordinary, routine litigation incidental to the Company s business.  The Company is not party to any material litigation that does not constitute ordinary, routine litigation incidental to its business. 

Item 1A.   Risk Factors 
    
  Risk factors that may affect the Company s business, results of operations and financial condition are described in Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016 and there have been no material changes from the risk factors disclosed.

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  The following table details share repurchases made by the Company during the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017: 

(1) On November 20, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized a repurchase of up to $25 million of the Company's common shares.  On November 19, 2015, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $20 million of the Company's common shares.  This authorization is in addition to the stock repurchase program authorized on November 20, 2014.  Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, or through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, at prices and on terms the Company deems appropriate and subject to the Company's cash requirements for other purposes, compliance with the covenants under the Company's revolving credit facility, and other factors management deems relevant.  The authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire a specific number of shares during any period, and the authorization may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Board.  Management expects to fund share repurchases using available cash and cash generated from operations.  Repurchased shares will become authorized but unissued common shares.  In the   second   quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company repurchased   67,400   common shares for an aggregate purchase price of $5.3 million, under the authorization, pursuant to a repurchase plan intended to comply with the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 and Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  At   October 31, 2016  ,   $18.0 million   remained authorized by the Company's Board of Directors to repurchase the Company's common shares.   
    
  On November 30, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized an additional stock repurchase program of up to $50 million of the Company's common shares. This authorization is in addition to the stock repurchase programs authorized on November 19, 2015 and November 20, 2014. Repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, or through privately negotiated transactions or otherwise, in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, at prices and on terms the Company deems appropriate and subject to the Company's cash requirements for other purposes, compliance with the covenants under the Company's revolving credit facility, and other factors management deems relevant. The authorization does not obligate the Company to acquire a specific number of shares during any period, and the authorization may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time at the discretion of the Board. Management expects to fund share repurchases using available cash and cash generated from operations. Repurchased shares will become authorized but unissued common shares.  The November 30, 2016 authorization is not reflected in the table above since it occurred after the quarter ended.

Exhibit 

Exhibit 31.1    
  CERTIFICATION UNDER SECTION 302  
  OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002  
  CERTIFICATION  
  I, S. Cary Dunston, certify that:  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this report on Form 10-Q of American Woodmark Corporation;  
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;  
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;  
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  
              a. 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
              b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;
