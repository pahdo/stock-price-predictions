  1. Description of Business, Basis of Presentation, and Operating Segment 
    
  (a) Description of Business 
    
  Endologix, Inc. (the "Company") is a Delaware corporation with corporate headquarters in Irvine, California and production facilities located in Irvine, California and Santa Rosa, California. The Company develops, manufactures, markets, and sells innovative medical devices for the treatment of aortic disorders. The Company's products are intended for the minimally invasive endovascular treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms ("AAA"). The Company's AAA products include innovations for minimally-invasive endovascular aneurysm repair ("EVAR") or endovascular aneurysm sealing ( EVAS ), the Company's innovative solution for sealing the aneurysm sac while maintaining blood flow through two blood flow lumens. The Company's current EVAR products include the Ovation  Abdominal Stent Graft System ( Ovation ), and the AFX  Endovascular AAA System ( AFX ) which features the VELA  Proximal Endograft System ( VELA ) and the AFX2 Bifurcated Endograft System ( AFX2 ). The Company's current EVAS product is the Nellix  EndoVascular Aneurysm Sealing System ( Nellix EVAS System ). Sales of the Company's EVAR and EVAS platforms (including extensions and accessories) to hospitals in the U.S. and Europe, and to third-party international distributors worldwide, provide the sole source of the Company's reported revenue. 
    
  On February 3, 2016, the Company completed the previously announced acquisition of TriVascular Technologies, Inc. ( TriVascular ). The acquisition expanded our product offering and intellectual property, increased our sales force, and enhanced our product development capabilities.  
    
  The Company s Ovation products consist of a radiopaque nitinol stent for suprarenal fixation and a low-permeability polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft. The stent is designed with integral anchors to enable fixation to the aortic wall. To seal the graft and to provide support for the aortic body legs into which the iliac limbs are deployed, the graft contains a network of inflatable rings that are filled with a liquid polymer that solidifies during the deployment procedure.   
    
  The Company's AFX products consist of (i) a cobalt chromium alloy stent covered by polytetrafluoroethylene (commonly referred to as "ePTFE") graft material ( Stent Graft ) and (ii) accompanying delivery systems. Once fixed in its proper position within the abdominal aortic bifurcation, the Company's AFX device provides a conduit for blood flow, thereby relieving pressure within the weakened or  aneurysmal  section of the vessel wall, which greatly reduces the potential for the AAA to rupture.   
    
  The Company's Nellix EVAS System product consists of (i) bilateral covered stents with endobags, (ii) a biocompatible polymer injected into the endobags to seal the aneurysm and (iii) a delivery system and polymer dispenser. The Company's EVAS product seals the entire aneurysm sac effectively excluding the aneurysm reducing the likelihood of future aneurysm rupture. Additionally, it has the potential to reduce post procedural re-interventions. 
             
  (b)     Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP") and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). These financial statements include the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company, including its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly-owned. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no related party transactions.  
    
  The interim financial data as of   September 30, 2016   is unaudited and is not necessarily indicative of the results for a full year. In the opinion of the Company's management, the interim data includes normal and recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to SEC rules and regulations relating to interim financial statements. The interim financial data includes the results of TriVascular Technologies, Inc., beginning on February 3, 2016, the date of the acquisition.  
    
  The accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016.

On May 28, 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU ") No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers", which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The FASB agreed to a one-year deferral of the revenue recognition standard's effective date for all entities. The new standard is effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method.  Early application is permitted, but not before the original effective date, which would have been January 1, 2017 for the Company. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has begun its analysis of adopting the standard and evaluating the impact the standard will have on its financial reporting but has not yet selected a transition method nor has it determined the effect of the standard on its ongoing financial reporting. 
    
  On April 7, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the debt liability, similar to the presentation of debt discounts. The ASU was effective for the Company on January 1, 2016. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" during the first quarter of 2016, utilizing retrospective application as permitted. As a result, the Company reclassified debt issuance costs from other assets to reduce the convertible notes as of December 31, 2015 and as of September 30, 2016. In conjunction with the Company s adoption of ASU 2015-03, the Company also adopted an update thereof or ASU 2015-15  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of Credit Arrangements.  As a result, the Company classified debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as other assets.   
    
  On July 22, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which requires an entity to measure inventory within the scope of the amendment at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,  which requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The new guidance also requires that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard and has applied it to provisional amounts related to the TriVascular acquisition.  
    
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which amends the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and creates Topic 842,  Leases.  The new topic supersedes Topic 840,  Leases,  and increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires disclosures of key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 mandates a modified retrospective transition method. The Company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which includes multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of accounting and reporting for share-based payments. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods, and interim periods therein, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the presentation and classification of specific cash flow items to improve consistency within the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

On October 24, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16,  Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory,  which requires an entity to immediately recognize the tax consequences of intercompany transfer other than inventory. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
  (c) Operating Segment 
    
  The Company has   one   operating and reporting segment that is focused exclusively on the development, manufacture, marketing, and sale of EVAR and EVAS product for the treatment of aortic disorders.  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , all of the Company's revenue and related expenses were solely attributable to these activities. Substantially all of the Company's long-lived assets are located in the U.S. 

2. Use of Estimates and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company's management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, the Company's management evaluates its estimates, including those related to (i) collectibility of customer accounts; (ii) whether the cost of inventories can be recovered; (iii) the value of goodwill and intangible assets; (iv) realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities; (v) likelihood of payment and value of contingent liabilities; and (vi) potential outcome of litigation. Such estimates are based on management's judgment which takes into account historical experience and various assumptions. Nonetheless, actual results may differ from management's estimates. 
  For a complete summary of our significant accounting policies, please refer to Note 2, "Use of Estimates and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies", in Part II, Item 8, of our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , filed February 29, 2016. There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

3. Balance Sheet Account Detail 
    
  (a) Property and Equipment 
    
  Property and equipment consisted of the following:

(1) Difference in the value between these dates is mainly due to acquisition of TriVascular. Refer to Note 12 of the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 
  Amortization expense for intangible assets for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.0 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 amortization expense for intangible assets was   $2.6 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively.

Estimated amortization expense for the five succeeding years and thereafter is as follows: 

(d) Marketable securities 
    
        Investments in held-to-maturity marketable securities consist of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s investments included   5   held-to-maturity debt securities in unrealized loss positions with a total unrealized loss of approximately   $17 thousand   and a total fair market value of approximately   $10.5 million  . All investments with gross unrealized losses have been in unrealized loss positions for less than   2   months. The unrealized losses were caused by interest rate fluctuations. There was no change in the credit risk of the securities. The Company does not intend to sell the securities and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell the securities before the expected recovery of their amortized cost bases. There were no realized gains or losses on the investments for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . All of the Company's investments of held-to-maturity securities will mature within less than 12 months with an average maturity of   5   months.

(e) Fair Value Measurements 
    
        The following fair value hierarchy table presents information about each major category of the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :  

There were no re-measurements to fair value during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   of financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. There were no transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 securities during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  (f) Financial Instruments Not Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
    
  We measure the fair value of our Senior Notes carried at amortized cost quarterly for disclosure purposes. The estimated fair value of the Senior Notes is determined by Level 2 inputs and is based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or similar securities. Based on the market prices, the fair value of our long-term debt was   $249.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $207.9 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .

5. Net Loss Per Share 
  Net loss per share was calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  

The following outstanding Company securities, using the treasury stock method, were excluded from the above calculations of net loss per share because their impact would have been anti-dilutive: 

As discussed in Note 6, in December 2013, the Company issued   $86.3 million   in aggregate principal amount of   2.25%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2018 (the    2.25%   Senior Notes ) in an underwritten public offering. In November 2015, the Company also issued   $125.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.25%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (the    3.25%   Senior Notes ) in an underwritten public offering. Upon any conversion, the   2.25%   Senior Notes and/or   3.25%   Senior Notes, (collectively the "Senior Notes") may be settled, at the Company s election, in cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock. For purposes of calculating the maximum dilutive impact, the Company presumed that the Senior Notes will be settled in common stock with the resulting potential common shares included in diluted earnings per share if the effect is more dilutive. The effect of the conversion of the Senior Notes is excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share because the impact of these securities would be anti-dilutive. The potential dilutive effect of these securities is shown in the chart below: 

The effect of the contingently issuable common stock is excluded from the calculation of basic net loss per share until all necessary conditions for issuance have been satisfied. Refer to Note 9 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 

6. Credit Facilities 
    
   2.25% Convertible Senior Notes    
    
         On December 10, 2013, the Company issued   $86.3 million   in aggregate principal amount of   2.25%   Convertible Senior Notes (the    2.25%   Senior Notes ). The   2.25%   Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2018 unless earlier repurchased by the Company or converted. The Company received net proceeds of approximately   $82.6 million   from the sale of the   2.25%   Senior Notes, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by the Company. Interest is payable on the   2.25%   Senior Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning   June 15, 2016  .

The   2.25%   Senior Notes are governed by the terms of a base indenture (the  Base Indenture ), as supplemented by the first supplemental indenture relating to the   2.25%   Senior Notes (the  First Supplemental Indenture,  and together with the Base Indenture, the  Indenture ), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the  Trustee ), each of which were entered into on   December 10, 2013  .  
    
         The   2.25%   Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and are: (a) senior in right of payment to the Company s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the   2.25%   Senior Notes; (b) equal in right of payment to the Company s existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; (c) effectively junior to any of the Company s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (d) and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by the Company s subsidiaries. 
    
         The Company may not redeem the   2.25%   Senior Notes prior to   December 15, 2016  . On or after   December 15, 2016  , the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the   2.25%   Senior Notes, at its option, but only if the closing sale price of the Company s common stock for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any   30   consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the second trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, exceeds   130%   of the conversion price on each applicable trading day. The redemption price will equal   100%   of the principal amount of the   2.25%   Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the   2.25%   Senior Notes.  
    
         Holders may convert their   2.25%   Senior Notes at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding   September 15, 2018   only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2014, if the closing sale price of the Company s common stock, for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) in the period of   30   consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the calendar quarter in which the conversion occurs, is more than   130%   of the conversion price of the   2.25%   Senior Notes in effect on each applicable trading day; (2) during the   five   consecutive business-day period following any   five   consecutive trading-day period in which the trading price for the   2.25%   Senior Notes for each such trading day was less than   98%   of the closing sale price of the Company s common stock on such date multiplied by the then-current conversion rate; (3) if the Company calls all or any portion of the notes for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the second scheduled trading day prior to the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after   September 15, 2018   until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date, holders may surrender their   2.25%   Senior Notes for conversion at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.  
    
         Upon conversion, the Company will, at its election, pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock.  
    
         The initial conversion rate of the   2.25%   Senior Notes will be   41.6051   shares of the Company s common stock for each   $1,000   principal amount of   2.25%   Senior Notes, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately   $24.04   per share. Following certain corporate transactions that occur on or prior to the stated maturity date or the Company s delivery of a notice of redemption, the Company will increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its   2.25%   Senior Notes in connection with such a corporate transaction.  
    
         If a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture) occurs prior to the stated maturity date, holders may require the Company to purchase for cash all or any portion of their   2.25%   Senior Notes at a fundamental change purchase price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the   2.25%   Senior Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change purchase date.  
         The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants and events of default with respect to the   2.25%   Senior Notes. If an event of default (as defined in the Indenture) occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee or the holders of at least   25%   in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding   2.25%   Senior Notes may declare the principal amount of the   2.25%   Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately by notice to the Company (with a copy to the Trustee). If an event of default arising out of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company or a significant subsidiary (as set forth in the Indenture) occurs with respect to us, the principal amount of the   2.25%   Senior Notes and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will automatically become immediately due and payable.  
    
         Upon issuance and through   December 31, 2015  , the Company was not required to separate the conversion option in the   2.25%   Senior Notes under ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging", and has the ability to settle the   2.25%   Senior Notes in cash,

common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, at its option. In accordance with cash conversion guidance contained in ASC 470-20, "Debt with Conversion and Other Options", the Company accounted for the   2.25%   Senior Notes by allocating the issuance proceeds between the liability and the equity component. The equity component is classified in stockholders  equity and the resulting discount on the liability component is accreted such that interest expense equals the Company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate. The separation was performed by first determining the fair value of a similar debt that does not have an associated equity component. That amount was then deducted from the initial proceeds of the   2.25%   Senior Notes as a whole to arrive at a residual amount, which was allocated to the conversion feature that is classified as equity. The initial fair value of the indebtedness was   $66.9 million   resulting in a   $19.3 million   allocation to the embedded conversion option. The embedded conversion option was recorded in stockholders  equity and as debt discount, to be subsequently accreted to interest expense over the term of the   2.25%   Senior Notes. Underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses totaled   $3.7 million   and were allocated between the liability and the equity component in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively. As a result,   $2.9 million   attributable to the indebtedness was recorded as deferred financing costs in other assets, to be subsequently amortized as interest expense over the term of the   2.25%   Senior Notes, and   $0.8 million   attributable to the equity component was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital in stockholders  equity. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" during the first quarter of 2016, utilizing retrospective application as permitted. As a result, the Company reclassified   $1.9 million   of debt issuance costs from other assets to reduce the convertible notes as of   December 31, 2015  .  
    
        As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding borrowings of   $76.8 million  , and deferred financing costs of   $1.5 million  , related to the   2.25%   Senior Notes. There are no principal payments due during the term. Annual interest expense on these notes will range from   $5.7 million   to   $6.9 million   through maturity.   
    
      Capped Call Transactions 
    
         On December 10, 2013, in connection with the pricing of the   2.25%   Senior Notes and the exercise in full of their overallotment option by the underwriters, the Company entered into privately-negotiated capped call transactions (the  Capped Call Transactions ) with Bank of America, N.A., an affiliate of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated. The Capped Call Transactions initial conversion rate and number of options substantially corresponds to each $1,000 principal amount of   2.25%   Senior Notes. The Company used approximately   $7.4 million   of the net proceeds from the   2.25%   Senior Notes offering to pay for the cost of the Capped Call Transactions.  
    
         The Capped Call Transactions are separate transactions entered into by the Company with Bank of America, N.A., are not part of the terms of the   2.25%   Senior Notes and will not change the holders  rights under the   2.25%   Senior Notes. The Capped Call Transactions have anti-dilution adjustments substantially similar to those applicable to the   2.25%   Senior Notes. The Capped Call Transactions are derivative instruments that are recorded within stockholders  equity because they meet an exemption from mark-to-market derivative accounting. 
    
         The Capped Call Transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments that the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount upon conversion of the   2.25%   Senior Notes in the event that the market price per share of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions, which initially corresponds to the   $24.04   conversion price of the   2.25%   Senior Notes. If, however, the market price per share of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the initial cap price of   $29.02  , there would nevertheless be dilution and/or there would not be an offset of such potential cash payments, in each case, to the extent that such market price exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions.  
    
         The Company will not be required to make any cash payments to Bank of America, N.A. or any of its affiliates upon the exercise of the options that are a part of the Capped Call Transactions, but will be entitled to receive from Bank of America, N.A. (or an affiliate thereof) a number of shares of the Company s common stock and/or an amount of cash generally based on the amount by which the market price per share of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, is greater than the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions during the relevant valuation period under the Capped Call Transactions. However, if the market price of the Company s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions, exceeds the cap price of the Capped Call Transactions during such valuation period under the Capped Call Transactions, the number of shares of common stock and/or the amount of cash the Company expects to receive upon exercise of the Capped Call Transactions will be capped based on the amount by which the cap price exceeds the strike price of the Capped Call Transactions.

For any conversions of   2.25%   Senior Notes prior to the close of business on the 55th scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date of the   2.25%   Senior Notes, including without limitation upon an acquisition of the Company or similar business combination, a corresponding portion of the Capped Call Transactions will be terminated. Upon such termination, the portion of the Capped Call Transactions being terminated will be settled at fair value (subject to certain limitations), as determined by Bank of America, N.A., in its capacity as calculation agent under the Capped Call Transactions, which the Company expects to receive from Bank of America, N.A., and no payments will be due Bank of America, N.A. The capped call expires on December 13, 2018. 
    
  3.25%   Convertible Senior Notes due 2020  
         On November 2, 2015, the Company issued   $125.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.25%   Senior Convertible Notes due 2020 (the    3.25%   Senior Notes ). The   3.25%   Senior Notes are governed by the Base Indenture, as amended and supplemented by the second supplemental indenture relating to the   3.25%   Senior Notes (the  Second Supplemental Indenture,  and together with the Base Indenture, the    3.25%   Senior Notes Indenture ), dated as of November 2, 2015, by and between the Company and the Trustee.  
         The   3.25%   Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and are: senior in right of payment to the Company s future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the   3.25%   Senior Notes; equal in right of payment to the Company s existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated, including the   2.25%   Senior Notes; effectively junior to any of the Company s secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all existing and future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by the Company s subsidiaries.  
         The   3.25%   Senior Notes accrue interest at a rate of   3.25%   per year, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year, commencing May 1, 2016. The   3.25%   Senior Notes mature on November 1, 2020, unless earlier purchased, redeemed or converted into shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the   3.25%   Senior Notes Indenture.  
  The Company may not redeem the   3.25%   Senior Notes prior to November 1, 2018. On or after November 1, 2018, the Company may redeem for cash all or any portion of the   3.25%   Senior Notes, at its option, but only if the closing sale price of the Company s common stock for at least   20   trading days (whether or not consecutive) during any   30   consecutive trading day period ending on, and including, the second trading day immediately preceding the date on which the Company provides notice of redemption, exceeds   130%   of the conversion price on each applicable trading day. The redemption date can be no sooner than 30 trading days from the date on which notice of redemption is provided to the holders, during which time, up until two trading days prior to the redemption, the holders may elect to convert all or a portion of the   3.25%   Senior Notes into shares of the Company s common stock. The redemption price will equal   100%   of the principal amount of the   3.25%   Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date. No sinking fund is provided for the   3.25%   Senior Notes.  
   The   3.25%   Senior Notes are convertible at the option of the holders: (1) in the calendar quarter following any quarter in which, for at least   20   out of the   30   consecutive trading days (whether or not consecutive) ending on the last day of the quarter, the closing price of the Company s common stock is more than   130%   of the then-current conversion price of the   3.25%   Senior Notes; (2) in the   five   business days following any   five   day period in which the trading price per $1,000 note was less than   98%   of the product of the closing sale price of the Company s common stock and the current conversion rate; (3) in the event that the Company has provided notice of redemption, but no later than two trading days prior to Company s proposed redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after August 1, 2020 until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the stated maturity date, holders may surrender their   3.25%   Senior Notes for conversion at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances.  
  The initial conversion rate of the   3.25%   Senior Notes is   89.4314   shares of the Company s common stock per   1,000   principal amount of the  3.25%   Senior Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately   $11.18   per share. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specified events. Upon conversion, the Company will at its election pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of the Company s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company s common stock.  
  If a fundamental change (as defined in the   3.25%   Senior Notes Indenture) occurs prior to the stated maturity date, holders may require the Company to purchase for cash all or any portion of their   3.25%   Senior Notes at a fundamental change purchase price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the   3.25%   Senior Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest.  
  The   3.25%   Senior Notes Indenture contains customary terms and covenants and events of default with respect to the   3.25%   Senior Notes. If an event of default (as defined in the   3.25%   Senior Notes Indenture) occurs and is continuing, either the Trustee

or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding   3.25%   Senior Notes may declare the principal amount of the   3.25%   Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately by notice to the Company (with a copy to the Trustee). If an event of default arising out of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company or a significant subsidiary (as set forth in the   3.25%   Senior Notes Indenture) occurs with respect to us, the principal amount of the   3.25%   Senior Notes and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will automatically become immediately due and payable.  
   Upon issuance and through December 31, 2015, the Company was not required to separate the conversion option from the   3.25%   Senior Notes under ASC 815, "Derivatives and Hedging". However, because the Company has the ability to settle the   3.25%   Senior Notes in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock, the Company applied the cash conversion guidance contained in ASC 470-20, "Debt With Conversion and other Options", and accounted for the   3.25%   Senior Notes by allocating the issuance proceeds between the liability-classified debt component and a separate equity component attributable to the conversion option. The equity component is classified in stockholders  equity and the resulting discount on the liability component is accreted such that interest expense equals the Company s borrowing rate for nonconvertible loan products of similar duration. The separation was performed by first determining the fair value of a similar debt that does not have an associated equity component. That amount was then deducted from the initial proceeds of the   3.25%   Senior Notes as a whole to arrive at a residual amount, which was allocated to the conversion feature that is classified as equity. The initial fair value of the indebtedness was   $97.8 million   resulting in a   $27.2 million   allocation to the embedded conversion option. The embedded conversion option was recorded in stockholders  equity and as a debt discount, to be subsequently accreted to interest expense over the term of the   3.25%   Senior Notes. Underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses totaled   $3.7 million   and were allocated between the liability and the equity component in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively. As a result,   $2.9 million   attributable to the indebtedness was recorded as deferred financing costs  in other assets, to be subsequently amortized as interest expense over the term of the   3.25%   Senior Notes, and   $0.8 million   attributable to the equity component was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital in stockholders  equity. The company adopted ASU 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" during the first quarter of 2016, utilizing retrospective application as permitted. As a result, the Company reclassified   $2.9 million   of debt issuance costs from other assets to reduce the convertible notes as of December 31, 2015.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding borrowings of    $101.9 million  , and deferred financing costs of   $2.5 million  , related to the   3.25%   Senior Notes. There are no principal payments due during the term. Annual interest expense on these   3.25%   Senior Notes will range from   $9.1 million   to   $10.7 million   through maturity.  
  In connection with its merger with TriVascular Technologies, Inc. ("TriVascular") in February 2016, the Company issued   13.6 million   shares of common stock as consideration to the former stockholders. As a result of the Company's issuance of such shares in the merger, the quantity of authorized common shares available for future issuance was reduced to a level insufficient to honor all of the potential common shares underlying instruments then outstanding. Such instruments include the conversion options related to the   3.25%   Senior Notes and   2.25%   Senior Notes, employee stock options, restricted stock units, contingently issuable common stock relating to the prior Nellix acquisition, and stock warrants. The creation of this authorized share deficiency in February 2016 required the Company, during the first quarter of 2016, to separate as a stand-alone derivative the   3.25%   Senior Notes conversion option and a portion of the   2.25%   Senior Notes conversion option for which no authorized shares are available to effect share settlement in the event of a conversion. Accordingly, in February 2016 the Company re-classed   $24.8 million   of the conversion features originally recorded in stockholder s equity of the Senior Notes to derivative liabilities which will be marked to market each period until the Company authorizes sufficient new common shares to alleviate the deficiency.  
  On June 2, 2016, the Company amended their Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from   100,000,000   to   135,000,000  , which is currently at a level sufficient to alleviate the share deficiency. Accordingly, on June 2, 2016, the Company re-classed   $68.6 million   of the conversion features of the Senior Notes from derivative liabilities to additional paid-in capital. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $0.0 million   and   $43.8 million  , respectively as a fair value adjustment of derivative liabilities. The primary factor causing the change in the fair value of the derivative liability was during the period February 3, 2016 through June 2, 2016 when the Company's stock price increased. Adjustments to the fair value of the derivative liabilities are recognized within other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
  The value of the derivative liabilities were estimated using a  with  and  without  approach utilizing observable and unobservable inputs causing this to be a Level 3 measurement. In the  with  scenario, the value of the Senior Notes were estimated in a binomial lattice model that considers all terms of the Senior Notes, including the conversion features, with a range of probabilities and assumptions related to the timing and likelihood of the conversion features being exercised by either the Company or the holders of the Senior Notes. In the  without  scenario the value of the Senior Notes absent the conversion

options were estimated. The difference between the values estimated in the  with  and  without  scenarios represents the value of the derivative liabilities. Changes in the value of the derivative liabilities were driven by changes in the Company s stock price, expected volatility, credit spreads, and market yields. 
    
     Bank of America line of credit 
    
  On   July 21, 2015  , the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with Bank of America, N.A. ( BOA ), whereby the Company could borrow up to   $20.0 million   (the  BOA Credit Facility ). All amounts owing under the BOA Credit Facility would become due and payable upon its expiration on   July 21, 2017  . A sub-feature in the line of credit allowed for the issuance of up to   $10.0 million   in letters of credit. The BOA Credit Facility was collateralized by all of the Company's assets, except its intellectual property. The BOA Credit Facility could be terminated at any time during the two year term by the Company upon three business days      notice. The BOA Credit Facility usage was priced at a spread over the one, two, three and six month LIBOR rates, and was subject to a covenant related to timely providing publicly reported information and a liquidity covenant tied to  Unencumbered Liquid Assets  ("ULA") of not less than   $30.0 million  . If not in default, the Company had the ability to reduce the ULA covenant requirement by reducing the BOA Credit Facility, with the ULA maintained at   1.5   times the BOA Credit Facility.  
  The Company terminated the BOA Credit Facility on July 29, 2016 concurrent with its entry into a credit and security agreement with MidCap.   
    
  Japan Lifeline Co., Ltd. Credit Facility 
    
  On July 4, 2016, the Company entered into a loan agreement with Japan Lifeline Co., Ltd. ( JLL ), the Company s Japanese distributor, pursuant to which, on July 11, 2016, the Company borrowed   $6.0 million   (the  JLL Credit Facility ). All amounts owing under the JLL Credit Facility accrued interest at a rate of   1.5%   per annum and would become due and payable upon the earlier of (a) a business day within 30 days following the termination of the Company s distribution agreement with JLL and (b) the end of the amended Initial Term (as defined in the Distribution Agreement) of the Distribution Agreement.  The JLL Credit Facility was collateralized by all of the Company's assets, except its intellectual property. The Company terminated the JLL Credit Facility on July 29, 2016 concurrent with its entry into a credit and security agreement with MidCap and repaid all amounts previously borrowed and unpaid. 
    
  MidCap Credit Facility 
    
  On July 29, 2016, the Company entered into a credit and security agreement with MidCap Financial Trust ("MidCap"), as agent for the lenders party thereto and as a lender, whereby the Company may borrow up to the lesser of   $50.0 million   or its applicable borrowing base of asset-based revolving loans (the  MidCap Credit Facility ). All amounts owing under the MidCap Credit Facility shall accrue interest at a rate equal to the LIBOR Rate plus four and one tenth percent (  4.10%  ). For purposes of the MidCap Credit Facility, LIBOR Rate means a per annum rate of interest equal to the greater of (a) one half of one percent (  0.50%  ) and (b) the rate determined by MidCap by dividing (i) the Base LIBOR Rate, meaning the base London interbank offer rate for the applicable interest period, by (ii) the sum of one minus the daily average during such interest period of the aggregate maximum reserve requirement then imposed under Regulation D of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System for  Eurocurrency Liabilities  (as defined therein). At September 30, 2016, the interest rate was   4.6%  . The Company is subject to other fees in addition to interest on outstanding borrowings ( Other Fees ) related to the MidCap Credit Facility. A balance minimum of the lesser of   $10.0 million   and average borrowing base during the immediately preceding month ( Minimum Balance ) is used in calculating Other Fees as described hereto. The Unused Line Fee is based on the difference between the preceding month s average outstanding borrowings and the Minimum Balance, multiplied by   0.50%   per annum. Additionally, a Minimum Balance Fee is assessed on the positive difference between the Minimum Balance and the preceding month s average outstanding borrowings, multiplied by the highest, per annum, prevailing interest rate during the month per the MidCap Credit Facility agreement. Lastly, a Collateral Management Fee is assessed on the greater of the preceding month s average outstanding borrowings or the Minimum Balance, multiplied by   0.50%   per annum.  
    
  Deferred financing costs directly related to the MidCap Credit Facility such as legal, origination, and professional services fees totaled   $0.9 million  . In conjunction with the Company s adoption of ASU 2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  during the first quarter of 2016, the Company also adopted an update thereof or ASU 2015-15  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of Credit Arrangements.  As a result,   $0.9 million   attributable to the MidCap Credit Facility was recorded as deferred financing costs in other assets, to be subsequently amortized

as interest expense over the term of the MidCap Credit Facility. The MidCap Credit Facility also contains a lockbox arrangement clause requiring the Company to maintain a lockbox bank account in favor of the MidCap Credit Facility; Company cash receipts remitted to the lockbox bank account are swept on a regular basis to reduce outstanding borrowings related to the MidCap Credit Facility. 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had   $0   in outstanding borrowings and   $0.9 million   in deferred financing costs related to the MidCap Credit Facility. 
    
  The MidCap Credit Facility includes a subjective acceleration clause that would prompt outstanding borrowings under the credit facility to become immediately due and payable, together with accrued interest and Other Fees. A material adverse change in the Company s business condition, any default in performance or compliance of the terms set in the MidCap Credit Facility, or the inability to repay the outstanding borrowings based on MidCap s discretion, can trigger the subjective acceleration clause. 
    
  The MidCap Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the Company's assets, excluding its intellectual property ( Collateral ), and places customary limitations on indebtedness, liens, distributions, acquisitions, investments, and other activities of the Company in a manner designed to protect the Collateral. The Company could be materially affected if it violates any covenants, as MidCap could declare all outstanding borrowing related to the MidCap Credit Facility, together with accrued interest and Other Fees, to be immediately due and payable. The MidCap Credit Facility is also subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants for asset-based revolving credit facilities, including a minimum net revenue covenant. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants. The MidCap Credit Facility is scheduled to terminate on July 29, 2020. 
    
  In conjunction with the Company s termination of the BOA Credit Facility and concurrent entry into a credit and security agreement with Midcap in July 2016, the Company entered into a corporate credit card agreement whereby the Company is required to maintain a   $2.0 million   deposit in favor of the credit card issuer. The deposit account related to these credit cards will be presented as restricted cash on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

7. Revenue by Geographic Region 
  The Company's revenue by geographic region, was as follows: 

8. Commitments and Contingencies 
  (a) Leases 
  The Company leases its administrative, research, and manufacturing facilities located in Irvine, California, Santa Rosa, California and an administrative office located in Rosmalen, The Netherlands. These facility lease agreements require the Company to pay operating costs, including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, the Company has certain equipment under long-term agreements that are accounted for as operating leases.  
  In conjunction with the TriVascular merger, the Company assumed the lease for TriVascular's facility in Santa Rosa, California. The facility is being used for manufacturing, research   development, and administrative purposes and consists of   110,000   square feet under an operating lease scheduled to expire in February 2018, which may be renewed for an additional   5 years  , at the Company's option.

  (Unaudited) 

Future minimum payments by year under non-cancelable leases with initial terms in excess of one year were as follows as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Facilities rent expense for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $0.9 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 facilities rent expense was   $2.5 million   and   $1.8 million  , respectively. 
  (b) Employment Agreements and Retention Plan 
  On February 1, 2014, the Company entered into new employment agreements with certain of its executive officers under which payment and benefits would become payable in the event of termination by the Company for any reason other than cause, death or disability or termination by the employee for good reason (collectively, an  Involuntary Termination ) prior to, upon or following a change in control of the Company. The severance payment will generally be in a range of   six   to   eighteen   months of the employee s then current salary for an Involuntary Termination prior to a change in control of the Company, and will generally be in a range of   eighteen   to   twenty-four   months of the employee s then current salary for an Involuntary Termination upon or following a change in control of the Company. 
  (c) Legal Matters 
        We are from time to time involved in various claims and legal proceedings of a nature we believe are normal and incidental to a medical device business. These matters may include product liability, intellectual property, employment, and other general claims. Such cases and claims may raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the facts and circumstances of each particular case or claim, the jurisdiction in which each suit is brought, and differences in applicable law. We accrue for contingent liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The accruals are adjusted periodically as assessments change or as additional information becomes available. 
    
          LifePort Sciences LLC v. Endologix, Inc. 
      On December 28, 2012, LifePort Sciences, LLC ("LifePort") filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court, District of Delaware, alleging that certain of the Company's products infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 5,489,295, 5,676,696, 5,993,481, 6,117,167, 6,302,906, and 8,192,482, which were alleged to be owned by LifePort. On March 17, 2016, the Company entered into a Settlement and Patent License Agreement with LifePort (the  Settlement Agreement ) whereby LifePort granted the Company license rights to patents in exchange for a settlement of   $4.7 million  . The Settlement Agreement resolves this litigation and fully and finally releases the Company and LifePort from any claims arising out of or in connection with the litigation or the subject patents. The Settlement Agreement also contained a covenant not to sue for other patents owned by LifePort. However, since the subject patents were all expired and the Company was not currently using and has no plans to use the other patents owned by LifePort in products that could reach technological feasibility during the covenant not to sue period, there is no alternative future use and the full amount was recorded as settlement costs in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss. 
  (d) Contract Termination 
    
  In the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company sent notices of termination to certain of its distributors providing for the termination of the respective distribution agreements. In accordance with ASC No. 420  Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations , the Company expensed distributor termination costs in the period in which the written notification of termination occurred. As a result, the Company incurred termination costs of   $0   and   $2.6 million   for the three and   nine months

ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. Such termination costs are included in contract termination and business acquisition expenses for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

9. Contingently Issuable Common Stock 
            On October 27, 2010, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the  Merger Agreement ) with Nepal Acquisition Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( Merger Sub ), Nellix, Inc. ("Nellix"), certain of Nellix s stockholders named therein and Essex Woodlands Health Ventures, Inc., as representative of the former Nellix stockholders. On December 10, 2010 (the  Nellix Closing Date ), the Company completed the merger (the  Merger ) of Merger Sub with and into Nellix pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement. The purchase price consisted of   3.2 million   shares of the Company's common stock, issuable to the former Nellix stockholders as of the Nellix Closing Date, then representing a value of $  19.4 million  . Under the agreement, additional payments, solely in the form of shares of the Company's common stock (the  Contingent Payment ), could be made upon the achievement of a revenue milestone and a regulatory approval milestone (collectively, the  Nellix Milestones ).   
  Under the merger agreement, the ultimate value of each Contingent Payment would be determined on the date that each Nellix Milestone is achieved. The number of issuable shares would be established using an applicable per share price, which is subject to a ceiling and/or floor, resulting at the closing of the merger in a potential maximum of   10.2 million   shares issuable upon the achievement of the Nellix Milestones. As of the Closing Date, the aggregate fair value of the cash Contingent Payment was estimated to be $  28.2 million  .  
  The Merger Agreement provides that, in addition to the shares of common stock of the Company (the  Common Stock ) issued to the former Nellix stockholders at the closing of the Merger, the former Nellix stockholders were entitled to receive shares of the Common Stock if the Company s sales of a Nellix product (the  Nellix Product ) outside of the United States exceeded   $10.0 million   within a certain time period following the Company s receipt of CE mark approval for the Nellix Product (the  OUS Milestone ). The aggregate dollar value of the shares of the Common Stock to be issued upon achievement of the OUS Milestone ranged from a high of   $24.0 million  , or   6.9 million   shares, to a low of   $10.0 million  , or   1.3 million   shares. The price per share of the Common Stock to be issued upon achievement of the OUS Milestone was subject to a floor of   $3.50   per share and a ceiling of   $7.50   per share. 
  On June 17, 2014, the Company announced its achievement of the OUS Milestone and the issuance of an aggregate of   2.7 million   unregistered shares of the Common Stock (the  OUS Milestone Shares ), plus an amount of cash in lieu of fractional shares, to the former Nellix stockholders. The Company offered and sold the OUS Milestone Shares in reliance upon exemptions from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ). The former Nellix stockholders previously gave representations to the Company regarding their investment intent, experience, financial sophistication, access to information regarding the Company and certain other matters to support the Company s reasonable belief that it could rely upon the foregoing exemptions from registration pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. No underwriting discounts or commissions were or will be paid in conjunction with the issuance of the OUS Milestone Shares. The Company previously filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (Registration No. 333-171639) (the  Form S-3 ) for the purpose of registering for resale shares of the Common Stock issued or issuable pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including the OUS Milestone Shares. The Securities and Exchange Commission declared the Form S-3 effective on January 18, 2011. 
  In addition, if the Company receives approval from the FDA to sell the Nellix Product in the United States (the  PMA Milestone ), the Company will issue additional shares of the Common Stock to the former stockholders of Nellix. The dollar value of the shares of the Common Stock to be issued upon achievement of the PMA Milestone will be equal to   $15.0 million   (less the dollar value of certain cash payments and other deductions). The price per share of the shares of the Common Stock to be issued upon achievement of the PMA Milestone is subject to a stock price floor of   $4.50   per share, but not subject to a stock price ceiling. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   the Company's stock price last closed at   $12.80   per share. Thus, had the PMA Milestone been achieved on   September 30, 2016   the Contingent Payment would have comprised   1.2 million   shares (based on the 30-day average closing stock price ending 5 days prior to the announcement), representing a value of   $15.7 million  .  
      The value of the Contingent Payment is derived using a discounted income approach model, with a range of probabilities and assumptions related to the timing and likelihood of achievement of the PMA Milestone (which include Level 3 inputs - see Note 3(e) and the Company's stock price (Level 1 input) as of the balance sheet date). These varying probabilities and

  (Unaudited) 

assumptions and changes in the Company's stock price have required fair value adjustments of the Contingent Payment in periods subsequent to the Nellix Closing Date.  
  The Contingent Payment fair value will continue to be evaluated on a quarterly basis until milestone achievement occurs, or until the expiration of the "earn-out period," as defined within the Nellix purchase agreement. Adjustments to the fair value of the Contingent Payment are recognized within other income (expense) in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Loss.  

10. Income Tax Expense 
    
  The Company applied an estimated annual effective tax rate ( ETR ) approach for calculating a tax provision for interim periods. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The Company's ETR was   (1.2)%   and   (0.6)%   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The Company's ETR for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of   34%   primarily as a result of nondeductible expenses (including the Nellix Contingent Payment and mark to market adjustment of derivative liabilities), state income taxes, foreign income taxes, and the impact of a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets. 
    
  The Company has evaluated the available evidence supporting the realization of its deferred tax assets, including the amount and timing of future taxable income, and has determined that it is more likely than not that its net deferred tax assets will not be realized in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. Due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of the deferred tax assets, the Company maintains a full valuation allowance against substantially all deferred tax assets. If/when the Company determines that it will be able to realize some portion or all of its deferred tax assets, an adjustment to its valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets would have the effect of increasing net income in the period(s) such determination is made. 

11. Restructuring Charges 
    
  In the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $8.6 million   in restructuring costs within operating expenses related to focused reductions of its workforce. The Company began substantially formulating plans around this workforce reduction during the first quarter of 2016 in conjunction with its merger of TriVascular. The targeted reductions and other restructuring activities were initiated to provide efficiencies and realign resources as well as to allow for continued investment in strategic areas and drive growth. The Company expects to incur a total of   $9.0 million   in restructuring charges upon the completion of the plan, which represents the Company s best estimate as of   September 30, 2016  . The recognition of restructuring charges requires that the Company make certain judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing and amount of costs associated with the planned reductions of workforce. At the end of each reporting period, the Company will evaluate the remaining accrued balance to ensure that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purpose in accordance with developed plans. The following table reflects the movement of activity of the restructuring reserve for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

The accrual balance as of   September 30, 2016   is classified within accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet.

12.   TriVascular Merger    
    
  On   February 3, 2016  , the Company completed its merger with TriVascular pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ), dated   October 26, 2015  , by and among Endologix, TriVascular and Teton Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Endologix ( Merger Sub ). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Endologix acquired all of TriVascular s outstanding capital stock through the merger of Merger Sub with and into TriVascular (the  Merger ), with TriVascular surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Endologix. The Company completed the merger in order to become the innovation leader with broad clinical indications for the treatment of AAA, leverage the combined company s commercial capabilities, and provide an accelerated path to profitability. The total purchase consideration given related to the acquisition follows:   

  Common stock consideration consisted of   13,586,503   shares of Endologix common stock, worth   $100.8 million   based on the market value of   $7.42   per share as of the effective date of the Merger on   February 3, 2016  . 
  In connection with the Merger, the Company assumed stock warrants, originally issued by TriVascular, and converted them to Endologix stock warrants. The fair value of the stock warrants represents a component of the total consideration for the Merger.  Stock warrants assumed were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model as of the effective date of the Merger. 
  The acquisition was recorded by allocating the costs of the net assets acquired based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of the acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. The fair values were based on management s analysis, including work performed by third-party valuation specialists. The following presents the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on   February 3, 2016   (in thousands): 

Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for this business combination upon the finalization of more detailed analyses of the facts and circumstances that existed at the date of the transaction will change the allocation of the purchase price. Any subsequent changes to the purchase allocation during the measurement period that are material will be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined in accordance with ASU 2015-16.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except per share, per unit, and number of years) 
  (Unaudited) 

The goodwill is primarily attributable to strategic opportunities that arose from the acquisition of TriVascular, such as broadening the product portfolio for the treatment of AAA and leveraging the combined company s technology and commercial capabilities. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are as follows (in thousands):  

During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company revised the opening net assets acquired and goodwill by   $205 thousand  , which comprised of the following: an increase in accounts receivable of   $30 thousand  ; an increase in accrued liabilities and other of   $192 thousand  ; and a decrease in inventories of   $43 thousand   as a result of gathering additional information during the measurement period. 
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company revised the opening net assets acquired and goodwill by   $27,201 thousand  , which comprised of the following: an increase in inventories of   $219 thousand  ; an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of   $77 thousand  ; an increase in accounts receivable of   $30 thousand  ; and an increase in accrued liabilities and other of   $556 thousand   as a result of gathering additional information during the measurement period. The Company also revised the initial values of intangible assets by decreasing them   $26,971 thousand   as a result of switching from utilizing publicly available benchmarking information to determine the fair value of the intangible assets to primarily utilizing an income method based on forecasts of expected future cash flows. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded an adjustment to the amortization of intangible assets of   $266 thousand  , comprising of a   $217 thousand   and   $49 thousand   decrease within cost of goods sold and marketing and sales expense, respectively, in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss, that would have been recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016, if the adjustment to the intangible assets had been recognized as of the date of the Merger. 
  Trade payables, as well as other current and non-current assets and liabilities, were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the fair value of those items at the acquisition date, based on management s judgments and estimates. Trade receivables included gross contractual amounts of   $5.8 million   and our best estimate of   $0.2 million   which represents contractual cash flows not expected to be collected at the acquisition date. 
  The fair value of property, plant and equipment utilized a combination of the cost and market approaches, depending on the characteristics of the asset classification. Of the   $46.2 million   of acquired intangible assets,   $7.5 million   was assigned to customer relationships (  10   year life),   $27.5 million   was assigned to developed technology (  11   year life), and   $11.2 million   was assigned to in-process research and development. 
  Due to the fact that the TriVascular acquisition has just recently occurred, the magnitude of the transaction, and the significant information to be obtained and analyzed, some of which resides in foreign jurisdictions, the Company s fair value estimates for the purchase price allocation are preliminary and may change during the allowable measurement period, which is up to the point the Company obtains and analyzes the information that existed as of the date of the acquisition necessary to determine the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, but in no case to exceed more than one year from the date of acquisition. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had not finalized the determination of fair values allocated to property, plant and equipment, identifiable intangible assets, inventory, other assets, deferred taxes, goodwill, tax uncertainties, income taxes payable, and other liabilities. Any changes in the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the measurement period may result in material adjustments to goodwill. 

Pro Forma Condensed Combined Financial Information (Unaudited) 
    
  The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information summarizes the results of operations for the periods indicated as if the TriVascular merger had been completed as of   January 1, 2015  . Pro forma information reflects adjustments that

  (all tabular amounts presented in thousands, except per share, per unit, and number of years) 
  (Unaudited) 

are expected to have a continuing impact on our results of operations and are directly attributable to the merger. The unaudited pro forma results include adjustments to reflect, among other things, the amortization of the inventory step-up, direct transaction costs relating to the acquisition, the incremental intangible asset amortization to be incurred based on the preliminary values of each identifiable intangible asset, and to eliminate interest expense related to legacy TriVascular's former loans, which was repaid upon completion of the TriVascular merger. The pro forma amounts do not purport to be indicative of the results that would have actually been obtained if the merger had occurred as of   January 1, 2015   or that may be obtained in the future, and do not reflect future synergies, integration costs, or other such costs or savings.   

  Included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss are net sales from products acquired as part of the TriVascular merger of   $11.0 million   and   $28.2 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. Net losses included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations and Comprehensive Loss from the TriVascular operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   have not been reported as it is impracticable to do so given the integration and other efficiency and cost saving measures in process during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

Overview  
          Our Business 
  Our corporate headquarters is located in Irvine, California and we have manufacturing facilities located in Irvine and Santa Rosa, California. We develop, manufacture, market, and sell innovative medical devices for the treatment of aortic disorders. Our principal products are intended for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms ("AAA"). Our AAA products are built on one of two platforms: (a) traditional minimally-invasive endovascular repair ("EVAR") or (b) endovascular sealing ( EVAS ), our innovative solution for sealing the aneurysm sac while maintaining blood flow through two blood flow lumens.  
  We sell our products through our direct U.S. and European sales forces and third-party international distributors and agents in other parts of the world.

  Recent Highlights of Our Product Development Initiatives, Clinical Trials and Regulatory Approvals 
    
         Nellix  
    
           In March 2016, we announced that the first two patients with AAAs in Japan had been treated with the Nellix  EndoVascular Aneurysm Sealing System (the  "Nellix EVAS System"). The patients were treated under Japan's "compassionate use" system, which grants access to physicians for use of medical treatments not yet approved in Japan for patients who are diagnosed with advanced diseases that are not responsive to existing treatment options. 
    
           In April 2016, we announced achievement of CE Mark approval of the next-generation Nellix EVAS System. The new Nellix EVAS system will be gradually introduced in Europe and other markets. In March 2016, we submitted our final premarket approval ("PMA") modules to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the  FDA ) and completed our 100-day PMA meeting with the FDA. The FDA has requested additional information and indicated that we may need to go to an Advisory Committee Panel. If we do have to go to an Advisory Committee Panel, we anticipate that the timeline for PMA approval for the Nellix EVAS System may extend into the third quarter of 2017. We are working collaboratively and in a timely manner with the FDA to provide the required information, and we remain confident that we will receive PMA approval for Nellix EVAS System based upon the IDE clinical results, data from other international studies and our worldwide experience, which now includes over 7,000 patients. 
  On December 10, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Nellix. Using the technology we acquired in the Nellix acquisition, we developed the Nellix EVAS System, a next-generation device, to treat infrarenal AAA. We have the following trials in process to build independent and collective clinical and economic evidence of clinical safety and effectiveness: 
             
    EVAS FORWARD Global Registry - This study is designed to provide real world clinical results to demonstrate the effectiveness and broad applicability of the Nellix EVAS System. The first phase of the registry included 300 patients  
     
   24 

     Table of Contents  

enrolled in up to 30 international centers. The first patient in the registry was treated in October 2013. In September 2014, we announced completion of patient enrollment in the Nellix EVAS FORWARD global registry. In April 2016, we announced updated data on 300 patients with a mean follow-up of 20 months along with results from a sub-analysis of 72 patients with concomitant AAA and iliac artery aneurysms that could not have been treated within the indications for use in traditional EVAR devices.  
             
    EVAS FORWARD IDE - Pivotal clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Nellix EVAS System. The study is a prospective single arm registry which enrolled 179 patients at 29 centers in the U.S. and Europe. In November 2014, we completed enrollment in the EVAS FORWARD IDE and submitted the one year results to the FDA in March 2016.  In May 2016, we announced the results of the one (1) year clinical data from the EVAS FORWARD IDE study that demonstrate that the Nellix EVAS System met the study primary endpoints for major adverse events at 30 days (safety) and Treatment Success at one year (effectiveness).  
                
    ASCEND Registry - In April 2016, we announced the first data presentation with one-year outcomes from the ASCEND Registry (Aneurysm Study for Complex AAA: Evaluation of Nellix Durability), a physician-initiated registry of the Nellix EVAS System used with aortic branch stent grafts for the treatment of patients with complex AAAs.  
           
      AFX  
    
  In September 2014, we announced a new clinical study called LEOPARD (Looking at EVAR Outcomes by Primary Analysis of Randomized Data). The study will provide a real-world comparison of the AFX system versus other commercially available EVAR devices. The LEOPARD study is designed to randomize and enroll up to 800 patients at 80 leading centers throughout the United States and commenced in the first quarter of 2015. The centers will be a mix of our current and new customers, with each investigator selecting one competitive device to randomize against AFX. The LEOPARD study is being led by an independent steering committee of leading physicians who will be involved with the study and responsible for presenting the results over the five-year follow-up period. 
    
  In December 2015, we announced that the AFX  Endovascular AAA System for the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms has received Shonin approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW). 
    
           In February 2016, we announced the completion of the first U.S. commercial implant of the Company's AFX 2 Bifurcated Endograft System ( AFX2 ). AFX2 reduces procedure steps for the delivery and deployment of the bifurcated endograft. AFX2 also facilitates percutaneous endovascular aneurysm repair, or PEVAR, by providing the lowest profile contralateral access through a 7F introducer. These improvements bring together our ActiveSeal  technology, DuraPly  ePTFE graft material and VELA  Proximal Endograft, into an integrated new EVAR system. 
    
  Ovation 
    
           In October 2014, TriVascular initiated the LIFE Study to illustrate the potential advantages of a fast tract protocol including PEVAR, local anesthesia, no time in ICU and a one night stay in the hospital with the Ovation System. In May 2016, we announced the completion of enrollment of 250 patients at 34 sites participating in the LIFE Study. In September 2016, we announced the results of the one-month clinical data from the LIFE Study that demonstrate that the Ovation System met the study primary endpoint for major adverse events at 30 days. 
    
           In early 2015, TriVascular initiated the LUCY Study which will evaluate the clinical benefits associated with EVAR using the Ovation System in patients with challenging anatomies including small access vessels. We expect to complete enrollment of the planned 225 patients around the end of 2016. 
    
           In February 2015, the FDA approved the next generation Ovation iX  Iliac Stent Graft for the Ovation System, and in July 2015, the FDA approved the Ovation iX  Abdominal Stent Graft System. In September 2015, the first patients were treated with the Ovation iX Abdominal Stent Graft System in Europe, and in August 2015, TriVascular initiated the launch of the Ovation iX System in the United States.

         Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented.  While management believes these estimates are reasonable and consistent, they are by their very nature, estimates of amounts that will depend on future events. Accordingly, actual results could differ from these estimates. Our Audit Committee periodically reviews our significant accounting policies.  
              For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to the  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  section in Part II, Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations , in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

     Table of Contents  

securities and   $2.1 million   used for machinery and equipment purchases. This is offset by proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities of   $37.9 million  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , cash provided by investing was   $23.3 million   and consisted of   $79.3 million   in maturities of marketable securities; offset by   $52.4 million   used to purchase marketable debt securities, and   $3.6 million   used for machinery and equipment purchases. 
         Financing Activities 
  Cash provided by financing activities was   $3.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to cash provided by financing activities of   $4.1 million   in the prior year period. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , cash provided by financing activities consisted of   $4.3 million   from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, offset by   $0.9 million   used to pay deferred financing costs and   $0.1 million   used to pay minimum tax withholdings on behalf of employees for restricted stock units vested during the period. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds of   $4.4 million   from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from sales of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, offset by   $0.3 million   used to pay minimum tax withholdings on behalf of employees for restricted stock units vested during the period. 
         Credit Arrangements 
    
          See Note 6 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
         Future Capital Requirements 
  We believe that the future growth of our business will depend upon our ability to successfully develop new technologies for the treatment of aortic disorders and successfully bring these technologies to market. We expect to incur significant expenditures in completing product development and clinical trials. 
  The timing and amount of our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including: 

the need for working capital to support our sales growth; 
                
    the need for additional capital to fund future development programs; 
                
    the need for additional capital to fund our sales force expansion; 
                
    the need for additional capital to fund strategic acquisitions; 
                
    our requirements for additional facility space or manufacturing capacity; 
                
    our requirements for additional information technology infrastructure and systems; and 
                
    adverse outcomes from potential litigation and the cost to defend such litigation. 
       
  We believe that our world-wide cash resources are adequate to operate our business. We presently have several operating subsidiaries and branches outside of the U.S. As of   September 30, 2016  , these subsidiaries and branches held an aggregate of   $7.6 million   in foreign bank accounts to fund their local operations. A portion of these balances relate to undistributed earnings, and are deemed by management to be permanently reinvested in the corresponding country in which our subsidiary operates. Management has no present or planned intention to repatriate foreign earnings into the U.S. However, in the event that we require additional funds in the U.S. and must repatriate any foreign earnings to meet those needs, we would then need to accrue, and ultimately pay, incremental income tax expenses on such  deemed dividend,  unless we then had sufficient net operating losses to offset this potential tax liability.  
    
  In the event we require additional financing in the future, it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Even if we are able to obtain financing, it may cause substantial dilution (in the case of an equity financing), or may contain burdensome restrictions on the operation of our business (in the case of debt financing). If we are not able to obtain required financing, we may need to curtail our operations and/or our planned product development.

Contractual Obligations     
         Contractual obligation payments by year with initial terms in excess of one year were as follows as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

Refer to Note 6 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of long-term debt obligations and Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of operating lease obligations. 
      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
         We have no off-balance sheet arrangements (except for operating leases) that provide financing, liquidity, market or credit risk support, or involve derivatives. In addition, we have no arrangements that may expose us to liability that are not expressly reflected in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
         As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as "structured finance" or "special purpose entities," established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not subject to any material financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships. 

Item 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
       
  We do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate or foreign currency transaction risks.  
    
  Interest Rate and Market Risk.   We have investments in U.S. Government and agency securities, corporate bonds and other debt securities. As a result, we are exposed to potential loss from market risks that may occur as a result of changes in interest rates, changes in credit quality of the issuer or otherwise.  
    
  We generally place our marketable security investments in high quality credit instruments, as specified in our investment policy guidelines. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate   $123 thousand   increase in the fair value of our investments as of   September 30, 2016  . We believe, however, that the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure, and our investment policy limits the amount of our credit exposure to any one issue, issuer (with the exception of U.S. agency obligations) and type of instrument. We do not expect any material loss from our marketable security investments and therefore believe that our potential interest rate exposure is limited. We intend to hold the majority of our investments to maturity, in accordance with our business plans.  
    
  We do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio. We are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk, market risk, and reinvestment risk. We attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only high credit quality securities and by positioning our portfolio to appropriately respond to a significant reduction in the credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor.  
    
  We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates on the MidCap Credit Facility. All outstanding amounts under the MidCap Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR, plus 4.10%. As of September 30, 2016, we had no amounts outstanding under the MidCap Credit Facility.   

Our Senior Notes bear fixed interest rates, and therefore, would not be subject to interest rate risk. The Capped Call transactions are derivative instruments that qualify for classification within stockholders  equity because they meet an exemption from mark-to-market derivative accounting. The settlement amounts for the capped call transactions are each determined based upon the difference between a strike price and a traded price of the Company s common stock.

Foreign Currency Transaction Risk.   While a majority of our business is denominated in the U.S. dollar, a portion of our revenue and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies. Fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the U.S. dollar and the Euro or the British Pound Sterling may affect our results of operations and the period-to-period comparisons of our operating results. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are caused by transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and must be remeasured at each balance sheet date or upon settlement. Foreign currency transaction realized and unrealized gains and losses resulted in approximately   $0.1 million   of gains during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $0.8 million   of losses during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily related to intercompany payables and receivables associated with our European operations. We expect to reduce our exposure through future settlements.  
    
  Market Price Sensitive Instruments.   In connection with our merger with TriVascular Technologies, Inc. ( TriVascular ) in February 2016, we issued 13.6 million shares of our common stock as consideration to the former stockholders of TriVascular. As a result of our issuance of such shares in the merger, the quantity of authorized common shares available for future issuance at that time was reduced to a level insufficient to honor all of the potential common shares underlying instruments then outstanding. Such instruments included the conversion options related to the 3.25% Senior Notes and 2.25% Senior Notes, employee stock options, restricted stock units, contingently issuable common stock relating to the prior Nellix acquisition, and stock warrants. The creation of this authorized share deficiency in February 2016 required us, during the first quarter of 2016, to separate as a stand-alone derivative the 3.25% Senior Notes conversion option and a portion of the 2.25% Senior Notes conversion option for which no authorized shares are available to effect share settlement in the event of a conversion. Accordingly, in February 2016 we re-classed $24.8 million of the equity component of the Senior Notes to derivative liabilities which will be marked to market each period.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded $43.8 million as a fair value adjustment of derivative liabilities primarily based on our stock price increasing from $7.42 to $13.06 from the date of reclassification. The value of the derivative liability and our earnings was subject to market price risk until we increased the number of our authorized common shares to alleviate the deficiency. In June 2016, upon the approval of our stockholders, we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of our authorized common shares eliminating the authorized share deficiency. 

Item 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
       
  We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report, were effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Following the completion of our merger with TriVascular on February 3, 2016, we have implemented internal controls over financial reporting to include consolidation of TriVascular, as well as acquisition-related accounting and disclosures. Our merger with TriVascular represents a material change in internal control over financial reporting since management s last assessment of our internal control over financial reporting, which was completed as of December 31, 2015. TriVascular utilizes separate information and accounting systems and processes. Our management is in the process of reviewing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting relating to TriVascular.  
  There have been no other material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Part II.  Other Information    

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings. 
       
  Refer to Note 8 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our legal proceedings. 
  We are from time to time involved in various other legal proceedings, most of which are routine litigation in the normal course of business. We believe that the resolution of the legal proceedings in which we are involved will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
