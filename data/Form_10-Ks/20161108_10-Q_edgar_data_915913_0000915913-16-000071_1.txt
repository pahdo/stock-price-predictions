NOTE 1 Basis of Presentation: 
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Albemarle Corporation and our wholly-owned, majority-owned and controlled subsidiaries (collectively,  Albemarle,   we,   us,   our  or  the Company ) contain all adjustments necessary for a fair statement, in all material respects, of our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our consolidated statements of income and consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and our consolidated statements of changes in equity and condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Other comprehensive income for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   includes an adjustment of   $12.5 million   to reduce the Foreign currency translation on the Company s investment in the Windfield Holdings Pty Ltd joint venture related to the three month period ended March 31, 2016. There is no impact to the results for the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company does not believe this adjustment is material to the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2016 or September 30, 2016. All other adjustments are of a normal and recurring nature. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on February 29, 2016. The   December 31, 2015   condensed consolidated balance sheet data herein was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) in the United States ( U.S. ). The results of operations for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Certain reclassifications have been made to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto to conform to the current presentation. 
  On June 17, 2016, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its Chemetall        Surface Treatment business to BASF SE. In the second quarter of 2016, the Company began accounting for this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and excluded the business from segment results for all periods presented. Related assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale for all periods presented in accordance with accounting standards for reporting discontinued operations. See Note 3,  Divestitures,  for additional information.  
  As described further in Note 2,  Acquisitions,  we completed our acquisition of Rockwood Holdings, Inc. ( Rockwood ) on January 12, 2015. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contained herein include the results of operations of Rockwood, commencing on January 13, 2015. 
   
  NOTE 2 Acquisitions: 
  On January 12, 2015 (the  Acquisition Closing Date ), we completed the acquisition of all the outstanding shares of Rockwood (the  Merger ) for a purchase price of approximately   $5.7 billion  . As a result, Rockwood became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Albemarle. 
  Purchase Price Allocation 
  The aggregate purchase price noted above was allocated to the major categories of assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values at the Acquisition Closing Date, which were based, in part, upon third-party appraisals for certain assets, including specifically-identified intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired was approximately   $2.8 billion   and was recorded as goodwill.

  ALBEMARLE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

The allocation of the Rockwood purchase price was finalized in the first quarter of 2016. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price paid and the amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the Rockwood acquisition based upon estimated fair values at the date of acquisition (in thousands): 

(a) 
    Total net assets acquired includes amounts for the Chemetall Surface Treatment business, which is reported as discontinued operations. See Note 3,  Divestitures,  for additional information. 
     Significant changes to the purchase price allocation since our initial preliminary estimates reported in the first quarter of 2015 were primarily related to decreases in the estimated fair values of certain current assets, property, plant and equipment, investments and intangible assets and increases in certain other noncurrent liabilities and noncontrolling interests, which resulted in an increase to recognized goodwill of approximately   $193.8 million  . This increase to recognized goodwill includes approximately   $1.5 million   that was recognized during the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016   based on changes to intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and deferred taxes. 
  Goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the anticipated synergies and economies of scale from the combined companies and the overall strategic importance of the acquired businesses to Albemarle. The goodwill attributable to the acquisition is not amortizable or deductible for tax purposes. 
  Included in Acquisition and integration related costs on our consolidated statements of income for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   is   $6.3 million   and   $42.4 million  , respectively, of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Rockwood (mainly consisting of professional services fees, costs to achieve synergies, relocation costs, and other integration costs) and   $0.4 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively, of costs in connection with other significant projects. The consolidated statements of income for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2015   include  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  
  ALBEMARLE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Unaudited) 

$35.5 million   and   $111.2 million  , respectively, of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Rockwood (mainly consisting of professional services and advisory fees, costs to achieve synergies, relocation costs, and other integration costs) and   $1.0 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively, of costs in connection with other significant projects. 
  The weighted-average amortization periods for the intangible assets acquired are   20   years for patents and technology,   20   years for trade names and trademarks and   24   years for customer lists and relationships. The weighted-average amortization period for all definite-lived intangible assets acquired is   23   years. 
  For the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016  , Depreciation and amortization expense included in Cost of goods sold was reduced by approximately   $0.2 million   as a result of measurement-period adjustments related to previous reporting periods. In addition, Income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of tax) was reduced by approximately   $4.1 million   for the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016   as a result of measurement-period adjustments related to previous reporting periods. 
  Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information 
  The following unaudited pro forma results of operations of the Company for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended September 30, 2015 assume that the Merger occurred on January 1, 2015. The pro forma amounts include certain adjustments, including interest expense, depreciation, amortization expense and income taxes. The pro forma amounts are also adjusted to exclude approximately   $41.8 million   and   $120.5 million  , respectively, of nonrecurring acquisition and integration related costs, and approximately   $16.8 million   and   $102.3 million  , respectively, of charges related to the utilization of the inventory markup as further described in Note 12,  Segment Information.  The pro forma results do not include adjustments related to cost savings or other synergies anticipated as a result of the Merger. In addition, the pro forma amounts are not adjusted to reflect the Chemetall Surface Treatment business as discontinued operations. Accordingly, these unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have been if the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2015, nor are they necessarily indicative of future results of operations. 

See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 2,  Acquisitions,  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for further details about the Rockwood acquisition. 
   
  NOTE 3 Divestitures: 
  Discontinued Operations 
  On June 17, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF SE for proceeds of approximately   $3.2 billion   in cash, subject to adjustment with respect to certain pension liabilities, cash, working capital and indebtedness. The sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business reflects the Company s commitment to investing in the future growth of its high priority businesses, reducing leverage and returning capital to shareholders. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approvals from regulatory authorities. At closing, any difference between the sales price and the proportionate carrying value of the interests being sold would be recognized. 
  The sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business, a separate reportable segment, qualifies for discontinued operations treatment because it represents a strategic shift     that will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results  . As a result, in the second quarter of 2016,     the Company began accounting for this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and excluded the business from segment results for all periods presented. Related assets and liabilities are classified as held for sale for all periods presented. As of the date this business qualified for discontinued

  (Unaudited) 

operations treatment, the Company stopped recording depreciation and amortization expense on assets of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business. 
  The major components of Income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of tax) for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (in thousands): 

(a) 
    Interest and financing expenses included the allocation of interest expense not directly attributable to other operations as well as interest expense related to debt to be assumed by the buyer. The allocation of interest expense to discontinued operations was based on the ratio of net assets held for sale to the sum of total net assets plus consolidated debt. 
              (b) 
    Income tax expense for the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016     included a discrete non-cash charge of   ($381.5) million   due to a change in the Company s assertion over book and tax basis differences related to a U.S. entity being sold. In addition, Income tax expense for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   included discrete non-cash benefits (charges) of   $5.4 million   and   ($29.8) million  , respectively, related to a change in the Company s assertion over reinvestment of foreign undistributed earnings. The associated liability of   $411.3 million   has been recorded in Deferred income taxes on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016. Upon completion of the sale, the buyer will not assume these outside basis differences, thus the liability is ultimately the responsibility of the Company, and as such, this amount is not recorded as a Liability held for sale. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, at which time any difference between the sales price and the proportionate carrying value of the interests being sold would be recognized. 
     The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities for the Chemetall Surface Treatment business classified as held for sale     at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , were as follows (in thousands):

Depreciation and amortization and capital expenditures from discontinued operations     for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (in thousands): 

Other Assets Held for Sale 
  In 2015, we announced our intention to pursue strategic alternatives, including divestitures, related to certain businesses, including the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals, fine chemistry services and metal sulfides businesses.   In the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined that the assets held for sale criteria were met for these businesses as well as a small group of assets at an idled site. As of the     December 31, 2015     balance sheet date, the Company expected to complete the sales of the businesses included in assets and liabilities held for sale and therefore such amounts were classified as current. These businesses did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment because the Company s management did not consider their sale or potential sale as representing a strategic shift     that had or will have a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results  .    
  On November 5, 2015, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its Tribotecc metal sulfides business to Treibacher Industrie AG. Included in the transaction were sites in Vienna and Arnoldstein, Austria, and Tribotecc s proprietary sulfide synthesis process. On January 4, 2016, t  he Company closed the sale of this business,     effective for the first day of business in 2016.     We received net proceeds of approximate  ly   $137 million   and recorded a gain of   $11.5 million   before income taxes in 2016 related to the sale of this business. 
  On December 16, 2015, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business to Huber Engineered Materials, a division of J.M. Huber Corporation. The transaction included Albemarle s Martinswerk GmbH subsidiary and manufacturing facility located in Bergheim, Germany, and Albemarle s     50%     ownership interest in Magnifin Magnesiaprodukte GmbH, a joint-venture with     Radex Heraklith Industriebeteiligung     AG at Breitenau, Au  stria. On February 1, 2016, the Company closed the sale of these businesses. We received net proceeds of approximately   $187 million   and   recorded     a gain of   $112.3 million   before income taxes in   2016 related to the sale of these businesses. 
  In April 2016, the Company concluded that it would discontinue efforts to sell its fine chemistry services business, and as a result, this business is accounted for as held and used beginning in the second quarter of 2016. 
  The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities of these businesses classified as held for sale at   December 31, 2015  , were as follows (in thousands):

Also included in Gain on sales of businesses, net, for the   nine-month period ended September 30, 2016   was a loss of   $1.5 million   on the sale of our wafer reclaim business. 

NOTE 4 Goodwill and Other Intangibles: 
  The following table summarizes the changes in goodwill by reportable segment for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(a) 
    The December 31, 2015 balances have been recast to reflect a change in segments. See Note 12,  Segment Information,      for further details. 
              (b) 
    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $1.5 billion   of Goodwill was classified as Assets held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3,  Divestitures,  for additional information. 
              (c) 
    Represents final purchase price adjustments for the Rockwood acquisition recorded in the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016  . Excludes     $3.2 million     of final purchase price adjustments for businesses reported as discontinued operations. 
              (d) 
    Represents Goodwill of the     fine chemistry services business, which was reported in Assets held for sale on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   December 31, 2015  .   See Note 3,  Divestitures,  for additional information. 
     The following table summarizes the changes in other intangibles and related accumulated amortization for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(a) 
    Included in Trade Names and Trademarks were indefinite-lived intangible assets with a gross carrying amount of   $8.8 million   and   $8.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
              (b) 
    Represents     Other intangibles and related amortization     of the     fine chemistry services business, which was reported in Assets held for sale on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   December 31, 2015  . See Note 3  Divestitures,  for additional information.

(c) 
    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $1.3 billion   and   $1.4 billion  , respectively, of Other intangibles, net of amortization were classified as Assets held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3  Divestitures,  for additional information. 

NOTE 5 Foreign Exchange: 
  Foreign exchange transaction gains (losses) were   $0.3 million   and   ($3.1) million   for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   ($1.2) million   and   $51.8 million   for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and were included in Other income, net, in our consolidated statements of income, with the unrealized portion included in Other, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. The gains in the   nine-month period ended September 30, 2015   were primarily related to cash denominated in U.S. Dollars held by foreign subsidiaries where the European Union Euro serves as the functional currency, which was repatriated using the applicable transaction rates during the first quarter of 2015. 
   
  NOTE 6 Income Taxes: 
  The effective income tax rate for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   was   11.1%   and   13.8%  , respectively, compared to   19.5%   and   23.2%   for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The Company s effective income tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, its level and location of income. The difference between the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate for the   2016   and   2015   periods was primarily due to the impact of earnings from outside the U.S. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily driven by a tax discrete benefit of   $5.5 million   related mainly to foreign provision to return adjustments. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily driven by income of   $122.3   million from the sales of businesses with associated tax expense of   $6.7   million, that was subject to tax at a rate below our effective tax rate and changes in impacts of earnings from outside the U.S.

considers Windfield to be a variable interest entity ( VIE ). However, the Company does not consolidate Windfield as it is not the primary beneficiary. The carrying amount of our   49%   equity interest in Windfield, which is our most significant VIE, was   $295.8 million   and   $280.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company s aggregate net investment in all other entities which it considers to be VIE s for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary was   $8.6 million   and   $7.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Our unconsolidated VIE s are reported in Investments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company does not guarantee debt for, or have other financial support obligations to, these entities, and its maximum exposure to loss in connection with its continuing involvement with these entities is limited to the carrying value of the investments. 
  Included in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, was a return of capital from Windfield of   $98.0 million  . 
   
  NOTE 10 Long-Term Debt: 
  Long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following (in thousands): 

(a) 
    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $16.5 million   and   $20.3 million  , respectively, of long-term debt was classified as Liabilities held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3,  Divestitures,  for additional information. 
     As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance effective January 1, 2016 on a retrospective basis, unamortized debt issuance costs are now deducted from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability on the balance sheet. The reclassification of these unamortized debt issuance costs resulted in reductions of   $17.1 million   in Long-term debt and Other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015. See Note 18,  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements,  for additional information. 
  Initial borrowings under our September 2015 Term Loan Agreement, which occurred on October 15, 2015, consisted of a   364  -day term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of   $300 million   (the  364-Day Facility ) and a   five  -year term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of   $950 million   (the  Five-Year Facility ), or collectively, the  Term Loan Facilities.  In the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016  , we repaid the 364-Day Facility in full and repaid approximately   $81 million   of borrowings under the Five-Year Facility, each primarily with proceeds from the sales of the metal sulfides business and the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business, which closed in the first quarter of 2016.  
  Current portion of long-term debt at   September 30, 2016   consisted primarily of commercial paper notes with a weighted-average interest rate of approximately   1.38%   and a weighted-average maturity of   39 days  . 
  The carrying value of our   1.875%   Euro-denominated senior notes has been designated as an effective hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries where the Euro serves as the functional currency, and gains or losses on the

revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. During the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016  , losses of   $7.4 million   and   $10.3 million   (net of income taxes), respectively, and during the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2015  , (losses) gains of   ($3.4) million   and   $39.7 million   (net of income taxes), respectively, were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss in connection with the revaluation of these senior notes to our reporting currency. 

NOTE 11 Commitments and Contingencies: 
  Environmental 
  We had the following activity in our recorded environmental liabilities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as follows (in thousands): 

(a) 
    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $3.9 million   of environmental liabilities were classified as Liabilities held for sale in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 3,  Divestitures,  for additional information. 
     Environmental remediation liabilities included discounted liabilities of   $23.8 million   and   $22.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, discounted at rates with a weighted-average of   3.5%  , with the undiscounted amount totaling   $63.3 million   and   $59.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. For certain locations where the Company is operating groundwater monitoring and/or remediation systems, prior owners or insurers have assumed all or most of the responsibility.  
  The amounts recorded represent our future remediation and other anticipated environmental liabilities. These liabilities typically arise during the normal course of our operational and environmental management activities or at the time of acquisition of the site, and are based on internal analysis as well as input from outside consultants. As evaluations proceed at each relevant site, changes in risk assessment practices, remediation techniques and regulatory requirements can occur, therefore such liability estimates may be adjusted accordingly. The timing and duration of remediation activities at these sites will be determined when evaluations are completed. Although it is difficult to quantify the potential financial impact of these remediation liabilities, management estimates (based on the latest available information) that there is a reasonable possibility that future environmental remediation costs associated with our past operations, in excess of amounts already recorded, could be up to approximately   $16 million   before income taxes. 
  We believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation matters in excess of the amounts recorded would likely occur over a period of time and would not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period. 
  Litigation 
  We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our business, including administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as CERCLA or Superfund, products liability, breach of contract liability and premises liability litigation. Where appropriate, we may establish financial reserves for such proceedings. We also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks. Costs for legal services are generally expensed as incurred.

Indemnities 
  We are indemnified by third parties in connection with certain matters related to acquired and divested businesses. Although we believe that the financial condition of those parties who may have indemnification obligations to the Company is generally sound, there can be no assurance that any party who may have obligations to indemnify us will adhere to their obligations and we may have to resort to legal action to enforce our rights under the indemnities. 
  The Company may be subject to indemnity claims relating to properties or businesses it divested, including properties or businesses that Rockwood divested prior to the Acquisition Closing Date. In the opinion of management, and based upon information currently available, the ultimate resolution of any indemnification obligations owed to the Company or by the Company is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Other 
  We have contracts with certain of our customers, which serve as guarantees on product delivery and performance according to customer specifications that can cover both shipments on an individual basis as well as blanket coverage of multiple shipments under certain customer supply contracts. The financial coverage provided by these guarantees is typically based on a percentage of net sales value. 
   
  NOTE 12 Segment Information: 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016, our former Performance Chemicals reportable segment was split into   two   reportable segments: (1) Lithium and Advanced Materials and (2) Bromine Specialties. In addition, on June 17, 2016, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell its Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF SE. This business, a separate reportable segment, is classified as discontinued operations and its results are excluded from segment results for all periods presented. As a result, our   three   reportable segments include Lithium and Advanced Materials, Bromine Specialties and Refining Solutions. Each segment has a dedicated team of sales, research and development, process engineering, manufacturing and sourcing, and business strategy personnel and has full accountability for improving execution through greater asset and market focus, agility and responsiveness. The new business structure aligns with the markets and customers we serve through each of the segments. The new structure also facilitates the continued standardization of business processes across the organization, and is consistent with the manner in which information is presently used internally by the Company s chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions. 
  Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables. Results for 2015 have been recast to reflect the change in segments noted above. 
  The  All Other  category comprises three operating segments that do not fit into any of our core businesses subsequent to the acquisition of Rockwood: minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals, fine chemistry services and metal sulfides. During the first quarter of   2016  , we completed the sales of the metal sulfides business and the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals businesses. For additional information about these businesses, see Note 3,  Divestitures.   
  The Corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporate-related items not allocated to the reportable segments. Pension and OPEB service cost (which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period) and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the reportable segments, All Other, and Corporate, whereas the remaining components of pension and OPEB benefits cost or credit ( Non-operating pension and OPEB items ) are included in Corporate. Segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs. 
  The Company s chief operating decision maker uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-recurring or unusual items such as acquisition and integration related costs, utilization of inventory markup, gains or losses on sales of businesses, restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges, non-operating pension and OPEB items and other significant non-recurring items ( adjusted EBITDA ), in a balanced manner and on a segment basis to assess the ongoing performance of the Company s business segments and to allocate resources. In addition, management uses adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performance-based compensation for management and other employees. The Company has reported adjusted EBITDA because management believes it provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income (loss) attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the

most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or any other financial measure reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

              (c) 
    In connection with the acquisition of Rockwood, the Company valued Rockwood s existing inventory at fair value as of the Acquisition Closing Date, which resulted in a markup of the underlying net book value of the inventory totaling approximately   $103.4 million  . The inventory markup was expensed over the estimated remaining selling period. For the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2015  ,   $7.7 million   and   $55.4 million  , respectively, was included in Cost of goods sold, and Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was reduced by   $9.1 million   and   $26.9 million  , respectively, related to the utilization of the inventory markup.

NOTE 13 Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefits: 
  The components of pension and postretirement benefits cost (credit) from continuing operations for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (in thousands):    

           (a) 
    For the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $3.7 million   and   $4.9 million  , respectively, of net pension and postretirement benefits cost are included in Income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of tax) in the consolidated statements of income. For the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2015  ,   $0.8 million   and   ($0.4) million  , respectively, of net pension and postretirement benefits cost (credit) are included in Income (loss) from discontinued operations (net of tax) in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 3,  Divestitures,  for additional information. 
     During the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016  , we made contributions of   $3.4 million   and   $11.4 million  , respectively, to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans related to continuing and discontinued operations. During the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2015  , we made contributions of   $4.8 million   and   $13.8 million  , respectively, to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans related to continuing and discontinued operations. 
  We paid   $0.7 million   and   $2.3 million   in premiums to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan during the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. During the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2015  , we paid   $0.9 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively, in premiums to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan.  
  Multiemployer Plan 
  Our contributions to the Pensionskasse Dynamit Nobel Versicherungsverein auf Gegenseitigkeit, Troisdorf ( DN Pensionskasse ) multiemployer plan for continuing and discontinued operations were    0.4 million   and    1.3 million   (approximately   $0.5 million   and   $1.4 million  ) during the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016  ,

respectively. During the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2015  , we made contributions of    0.5 million   and    1.2 million   (approximately   $0.6 million   and   $1.4 million  ), respectively, to the DN Pensionskasse multiemployer plan for continuing and discontinued operations. 
  Effective July 1, 2016, the DN Pensionskasse is subject to a financial improvement plan which expires on December 31, 2022. This financial improvement plan calls for increased capital reserves to avoid future underfunding risk. 
   
  NOTE 14 Fair Value of Financial Instruments: 
  In assessing the fair value of financial instruments, we use methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and other risk factors existing at the time of assessment. Fair value information for our financial instruments is as follows: 
  Long-Term Debt the fair values of our senior notes and other fixed rate foreign borrowings are estimated using Level 1 inputs and account for the majority of the difference between the recorded amount and fair value of our long-term debt. The carrying value of our remaining long-term debt reported in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets approximates fair value as substantially all of such debt bears interest based on prevailing variable market rates currently available in the countries in which we have borrowings. 

Foreign Currency Forward Contracts we enter into foreign currency forward contracts in connection with our risk management strategies in an attempt to minimize the financial impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. The fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts are estimated based on current settlement values. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts with notional values totaling   $465.5 million   and   $217.7 million  , respectively. Our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were not designated as hedging instruments under Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $0.2 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, was included in Accrued expenses associated with the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts. 
  Gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in Other income, net; further, fluctuations in the value of these contracts are generally expected to be offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged, which are also reported in Other income, net. For the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized gains (losses) of   $3.0 million   and   ($1.9) million  , respectively, in Other income, net, in our consolidated statements of income related to the change in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts. For the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized gains (losses) of   $2.5 million   and   ($14.1) million  , respectively, in Other income, net, in our consolidated statements of income related to the change in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts. Also, for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recorded losses of   $1.9 million   and   $14.1 million  , respectively, related to the change in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts, and net cash settlements of   $2.0 million   and   $13.0 million  , respectively, in Other, net, in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 
  The counterparties to our foreign currency forward contracts are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships. We are exposed to, but do not anticipate, credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties.

NOTE 15 Fair Value Measurement: 
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). The inputs used to measure fair value are classified into the following hierarchy: 
                 Level 1 
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

Level 2 
    Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities, or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability 

Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 

We endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy are deemed to have occurred on the date of the event or change in circumstance that caused the transfer. There were no transfers between Levels 1 and 2 during the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016  . The following tables set forth our financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands): 

(a) 
    We maintain an Executive Deferred Compensation Plan ( EDCP ) that was adopted in 2001 and subsequently amended. The purpose of the EDCP is to provide current tax planning opportunities as well as supplemental funds upon the retirement or death of certain of our employees. The EDCP is intended to aid in attracting and retaining employees of exceptional ability by providing them with these benefits. We also maintain a Benefit Protection Trust (the  Trust ), created to provide a source of funds to assist in meeting the obligations of the EDCP, subject to the claims of our creditors in the event of our insolvency. Assets of the Trust are consolidated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance. The assets of the Trust consist primarily of mutual fund investments (which are accounted for as trading securities and are marked-to-market on a monthly basis through the consolidated statements of income) and cash and cash equivalents. As such, these assets and obligations are classified within Level 1. 
              (b) 
    Primarily consists of private equity securities classified as available-for-sale and are reported in Investments in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The changes in fair value are reported in Other income, net, in our consolidated statements of income. Holdings in private equity securities are typically valued using the net asset valuations provided by the underlying private investment companies and as such are classified within Level 3. 
              (c) 
    As a result of our global operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial position. When deemed appropriate, we minimize our risks from

Unless otherwise noted, these derivative financial instruments are not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  . The foreign currency forward contracts are valued using broker quotations or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within Level 2.

NOTE 18 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements: 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued accounting guidance designed to enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions and capital markets. The core principle of the guidance is that revenue recognized from a transaction or event that arises from a contract with a customer should reflect the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services provided. To achieve that core principle the new guidance sets forth a five-step revenue recognition model that will need to be applied consistently to all contracts with customers, except those that are within the scope of other topics in the ASC. Also required are new disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows from contracts with customers. The new disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, significant judgments made in applying the revenue guidance, and assets recognized related to the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. In March 2016 and April 2016, the FASB issued amendments to this new guidance that provides clarification about principal versus agent considerations, identification of performance obligations and accounting for the licensing of intellectual property. In addition, in May 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to the guidance that provides clarification about collectibility, noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. These new requirements become effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The impact of these new requirements on our financial statements is being assessed and is not yet known.

In February 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance that changes the analysis that reporting entities must perform to determine whether certain types of legal entities should be consolidated. Specifically, the amendments affect (a) limited partnerships and similar legal entities; (b) the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships; and (c) certain investment funds. These amendments became effective on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In April and August 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance that changes the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs (except for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements). The guidance requires debt issuance costs relating to a recognized debt liability to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the associated debt liability in the balance sheet. This new requirement became effective on January 1, 2016. See Note 10,  Long-Term Debt  for additional information. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance that, among other things, provides for a practical expedient related to interim period remeasurements of defined benefit plan assets and obligations. The practical expedient permits entities to remeasure plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the date of the actual event. Disclosure of such election and related month-end remeasurement date is required. This guidance became effective on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance which clarifies the proper method of accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. The guidance requires software licenses included in a cloud computing arrangement to be accounted for consistently with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the arrangement should be accounted for as a service contract. This guidance became effective on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance for which investments measured at net asset value per share (or its equivalent) using the practical expedient should no longer be categorized within the fair value hierarchy. Although removed from the fair value hierarchy, disclosure of the nature, risks and amount of investments for which fair value is measured using the practical expedient is still required. This guidance became effective on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The scope of this guidance excludes inventory measured using the last-in first-out method or the retail inventory method. This new requirement will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that requires assets and liabilities arising from leases to be recorded on the balance sheet. Additional disclosures are required regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows from leases. This new guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The impact of this new requirement on our financial statements is being assessed and is not yet known. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment awards. Among other things, this guidance requires all tax effects related to share-based payment awards to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit on the income statement, thus eliminating all additional paid-in capital pools. An entity should recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces income taxes payable in the current period. For interim reporting purposes, excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies should be accounted for as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. Additionally, this new guidance requires all tax related cash flows resulting from share-based payments to be presented as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity. This guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The impact of this new requirement on our financial statements is being assessed and is not yet known. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued accounting guidance which clarifies the proper presentation and classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance addresses cash flow issues including, but not limited to, debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs and distributions received from equity method investments. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal

We assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forward-looking statements should circumstances change, except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws. The following discussion should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
  The following is a discussion and analysis of results of operations for the   three-month and nine-month   periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . A discussion of consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading  Financial Condition and Liquidity  on page 44. 
   
  Overview 
  We are a leading global developer, manufacturer and marketer of highly-engineered specialty chemicals that meets customer needs across an exceptionally diverse range of end markets. The end markets we serve include the petroleum refining, consumer electronics, energy storage, construction, automotive, steel and aerospace, lubricants, pharmaceuticals, crop protection, household appliances, heating, ventilation, aluminum finishing, food safety and custom chemistry services. We believe that our commercial and geographic diversity, technical expertise, innovative capability, flexible, low-cost global manufacturing base, experienced management team and strategic focus on our core base technologies will enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate. 
  Secular trends favorably impacting demand within the end markets that we serve combined with our diverse product portfolio, broad geographic presence and customer-focused solutions will continue to be key drivers to our future earnings growth. We continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative, yet commercially viable, clean energy products and services to the marketplace. We believe our disciplined cost reduction efforts, ongoing productivity improvements and the acquisition of Rockwood position us well to take advantage of strengthening economic conditions as they occur while softening the negative impact of the current challenging global economic environment. 
   
  Third Quarter     2016    
  During the   third   quarter of   2016  : 
             
    We signed a definitive agreement to acquire the lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonate conversion assets of Jiangxi Jiangli New Materials Science and Technology Co. Ltd. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of 2017, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. 
                
    We entered an agreement with Bolland Minera S.A., for the exclusive exploration and acquisition rights to a lithium resource in Antofalla, within the Catamarca Province of Argentina. 
                  
    Earnings per share from continuing operations were   $0.93   (on a diluted basis), an increase from   third   quarter   2015   results of   $0.48   per diluted share. 

Outlook 
  Effective January 1, 2016, the former Performance Chemicals segment was split into two reportable segments: (1) Lithium and Advanced Materials, which includes Performance Catalyst Solutions and Curatives ( PCS ), and (2) Bromine Specialties. Each segment has a dedicated team of sales, research and development, process engineering, manufacturing and sourcing, and business strategy personnel and has full accountability for improving execution through greater asset and market focus, agility and responsiveness. We expect this change to provide further clarity into the performance of each business. 
  On June 17, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF SE for consideration of approximately $3.2 billion in cash, subject to adjustment with respect to certain pension liabilities, cash, working capital and indebtedness. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
  The current global business environment presents a diverse set of opportunities and challenges in the markets we serve, from slow and uneven global growth, currency exchange volatility, significantly lower crude oil prices, a dynamic pricing environment in bromine derivatives and an ever-changing landscape in electronics, to the continuous need for cutting edge catalysts and technology by our refinery customers, diverse energy storage needs including exciting opportunities in electric

     Table of Contents  

vehicles, and increasingly stringent environmental standards. Amidst these dynamics, we believe our business fundamentals are sound and that we are strategically well-positioned as we remain focused on increasing sales volumes, significant deleveraging, optimizing and improving the value of our portfolio through pricing and product development, managing costs and delivering value to our customers. We believe that our businesses remain positioned to capitalize on new business opportunities and long-term trends driving growth within our end markets and to respond quickly to improved economic conditions. Additionally, we are well on track to exceed our initial expectations regarding synergies from the acquisition of the Rockwood businesses in 2015. 
  Lithium and Advanced Materials:   We expect continued strong growth for the remainder of 2016, led by demand in battery-grade applications and continued price improvement in Lithium. PCS experienced strong growth in 2015 due to market demand in general and due to certain competitor outages. While we expect most of the PCS business to maintain a similar level of profitability in 2016, weakness in the curatives market and the bankruptcy filing of one of our customers is expected to result in a $15 million impact to Income from continuing operations before income taxes and adjusted EBITDA over the course of the current year. 
  On a longer term basis, we believe that demand for lithium will continue to grow as new applications for lithium power continue to be developed and the use of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and battery electric vehicles escalates. In addition, we expect growth in PCS to come from growing global demand for plastics driven by rising standards of living and infrastructure spending, particularly in Asia and the Middle East. 
  Bromine Specialties:   We continue to expect the second half of 2016 results to be below first half on sales and profitability due to expected decline in demand for clear brine fluids used in offshore drilling projects, lower flame retardant volumes due to order timing and seasonality, and inventory rebalancing. Through working capital discipline and strong controls on costs, we expect to generate healthy cash flows in the Bromine business despite these second-half challenges. We believe that the combination of solid, long-term business fundamentals, with our strong cost position, product innovations and effective management of raw material costs will enable us to manage our business through end market challenges and to capitalize on opportunities that are expected with favorable market trends in select end markets. 
  On a longer term basis, we continue to believe that improving global standards of living, widespread digitization, increasing demand for data management capacity and the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations in developing markets are likely to drive continued demand for fire safety products. Demand for drilling completion fluids in the first half of 2016 held up better than expected, but we have seen lower demand since mid-year as a result of sustained low oil prices impacting offshore drilling projects around the world. Longer term, absent an increase in regulatory pressure on offshore drilling, we would expect this business to follow a solid growth trajectory once oil prices recover from recent levels as we expect that deep water drilling will continue to increase around the world. Net sales of flame retardants were also stronger than expected in the first half of 2016 due to favorable bid results as well as customer order timing. We are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets. We believe the global supply/demand gap will tighten as demand for existing and possible new uses of bromine expands over time. 
  Refining Solutions:   In 2016, despite some near-term concerns about how the price of oil will continue to impact the crude slate used by refineries and the resulting demand for catalysts, we expect to see continued, sustained high level performance from heavy oil upgrading as well as improvement in clean fuels technology results due to increased change outs by refiners and an improved product mix, although certain domestic oil companies, among others, are expected to look for ways to delay catalysts change outs due to the current oil economic environment. 
  On a longer term basis, we believe increased global demand for transportation fuels and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements will drive growth in our Refining Solutions business. Delivering superior end-use performance continues to be the most effective way to create sustainable value in the refinery catalysts industry, and we believe our technologies continue to provide significant performance and financial benefits to refiners challenged to meet tighter regulations around the world, those managing new contaminants present in North America tight oil, and those in the Middle East and Asia seeking to use heavier feedstock while pushing for higher propylene yields. While lower oil prices may impact the overall crude slate for a period of time, longer term, we believe that the global crude supply will get heavier and more sour, trends that bode well for catalysts demand. Given this and based on our technology, current production capacities and expected growth in end market demand, we believe that we remain well-positioned for the future. 
  All Other:   During the first quarter of   2016  , we closed the previously announced sales of the metal sulfides business and the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business. The cash generated from the sale of these businesses was used to reduce borrowings outstanding under the September 2015 Term Loan Agreement. 
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

In April 2016, we concluded that we would suspend efforts to sell the fine chemistry services business. This business will continue to be reported outside the Company s reportable segments.  
  Corporate:   In the first quarter of   2016  , we increased our quarterly dividend rate to   $0.305   per share. We continue to focus on cash generation, working capital management and process efficiencies. We expect our global effective tax rate for   2016   to be approximately   15.9%  ; however, our rate will vary based on the locales in which income is actually earned and remains subject to potential volatility from changing legislation in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. 
  We remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions or other business development activities that will complement our business footprint.

Net Sales 
  For the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net sales of   $654.0 million  ,   a decrease   of   $39.2 million  , or   6%  , compared to net sales of   $693.2 million   for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . On January 4, 2016, we closed the sale of the metal sulfides business and on February 1, 2016, we closed the sale of the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business. The divestiture of these businesses reduced net sales by $73.3 million as compared to the three-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding the impact of the divested businesses noted above, net sales increased by $34.1 million due to $31.2 million of higher volumes resulting from market demand and $2.7 million of favorable currency exchange impacts. 
  Gross Profit 
  For the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , our gross profit   increased     $19.9 million  , or   9%  , from the corresponding   2015   period. Gross profit includes charges of $7.7 million in the three-month period ended September 30,   2015   for the utilization of the inventory markup recorded as part of purchase accounting for the acquisition of Rockwood. The divestiture of our metal sulfides and minerals-based flame retardants businesses in the first quarter of 2016 reduced gross profit by $9.2 million as compared to the three-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding the inventory markup charges and the impact of divestitures, gross profit increased by $21.4 million, or 9.8%, due primarily to higher overall sales volumes and $4.6 million in lower variable and fixed costs. Overall, these factors contributed to a   higher   gross profit margin for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   of   36.5%  ,   up   from   31.6%   in the corresponding period in   2015  . Excluding the inventory markup charges and the impact of divestitures, gross profit margin was 36.3% for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 34.9% in the corresponding period in 2015. 
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
  For the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , our selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses   increased     $5.3 million  , or   7%  , from the three-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to timing of expenses and increased compensation costs, partially offset by a reduction in SG A costs associated with the divested businesses. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses were   13.2%   for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   11.7%   for the corresponding period in   2015  . 
  Research and Development Expenses 
  For the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , our research and development ( R D ) expenses   decreased     $0.9 million  , or   4%  , from the three-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . As a percentage of net sales, R D expenses were   3.2%   for the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Restructuring and Other, Net 
  Included in restructuring and other, net, for the third quarter of 2015 is a gain of $6.8 million ($4.7 million after income taxes) recognized upon the sale of the land in Avonmouth, UK, which was utilized by the phosphorus flame retardants business we exited in 2012.  
  Acquisition and Integration Related Costs 
  The three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   includes   $6.3 million   of integration costs resulting from the acquisition of Rockwood (mainly consisting of professional services, costs to achieve synergies, relocation costs, and other integration costs) and   $0.4 million   of costs in connection with other significant projects. The three-month period ended   September 30, 2015   includes   $35.5 million   of acquisition and integration related costs directly related to the acquisition of Rockwood and   $1.0 million   of costs in connection with other significant projects. 
  Interest and Financing Expenses 
  Interest and financing expenses for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     $3.3 million   to   $15.9 million   from the corresponding   2015   period, due mainly to lower debt levels as well as the favorable impact of the refinancing of the senior notes assumed from Rockwood that was completed on October 15, 2015. 
  Other Income, Net 
  Other income, net, for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   was   $3.0 million   versus   $0.1 million   for the corresponding   2015   period. The change was primarily due to a $2.9 million gain in the fair value of our investment in private equity securities recorded during the   third   quarter of   2016  . 
  Income Tax Expense 
  The effective income tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   was   11.1%   compared to   19.5%   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . Our effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates in the comparative periods primarily due  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

to the impact of earnings from outside the U.S. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily driven by a tax discrete benefit of $5.5 million related mainly to foreign provision to return adjustments. 
  Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Investments 
  Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was   $15.0 million   for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $5.7 million   in the same period last year. Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2015   includes a   $9.1 million   charge for utilization of fair value adjustments to inventories in connection with the Rockwood acquisition. Excluding this charge, equity in net income of unconsolidated investments increased by $0.2 million primarily due to higher equity income reported by our Lithium and Advanced Materials segment joint venture Windfield Holdings Pty Ltd primarily due to higher sales volumes. This was partially offset by the sale of our ownership interest in Magnifin Magnesiaprodukte GmbH during 2016. 
  Income from Discontinued Operations 
  Income from discontinued operations, after income taxes, was   $23.2 million   for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $11.0 million   in the same period last year. The change was primarily due to favorable sales prices and volumes due to market demand, no depreciation and amortization expense in the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   because of discontinued operations accounting, as well as lower interest expense, partially offset by increased SG A expenses of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business. 
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  For the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was   $9.5 million   compared to   $5.5 million   in the same period last year. This   increase   of $4.0 million was due primarily to an increase in consolidated income related to our Jordanian joint venture from higher sales volumes. 
  Net Income Attributable to Albemarle Corporation 
  Net income attributable to Albemarle Corporation   increased   to   $128.2 million   in the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $65.4 million   in the three-month period ended   September 30, 2015  . The three-month period ended   September 30, 2015   included a $13.6 million charge after income taxes for utilization of fair value adjustments to inventories. Excluding this charge, net income attributable to Albemarle increased by $49.2 million. The increase is primarily due to higher gross profit associated with stronger business results, a reduction in acquisition and integration costs, lower interest associated with lower debt levels and the favorable impact of the refinancing that was completed on October 15, 2015, in addition to a lower overall effective tax rate, partially offset by the impact of the divestitures and higher SG A expenses. 
  Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax 
  Total other comprehensive income (loss), after income taxes, was   $41.0 million   for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   ($70.4) million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The majority of these amounts are the result of translating our foreign subsidiary financial statements from their local currencies to U.S. Dollars. In the   2016   period, other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation adjustments was   $47.7 million  , mainly as a result of favorable movements in the European Union Euro of approximately $38 million and the Korean Won of approximately $8 million. The movement in the European Union Euro includes an adjustment of $12.5 million to reduce the Foreign currency translation on our investment in the Windfield Holdings Pty Ltd joint venture related to the three month period ended March 31, 2016. Also included in total other comprehensive income for the 2016 period is a loss of   $7.4 million   in connection with the revaluation of our  700.0 million senior notes which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations. In the   2015   period, other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was   $67.5 million  , mainly as a result of unfavorable movements in the British Pound Sterling of approximately $30 million, the Brazilian Real of approximately $18 million, the Chinese Renminbi of approximately $7 million, the Korean Won of approximately $7 million, and a net unfavorable variance in various other currencies totaling approximately $29 million (each approximately $5 million or less), partially offset by a favorable movement in the European Union Euro of approximately $25 million. Also included in total other comprehensive loss for the 2015 period is a loss of   $3.4 million   in connection with the revaluation of our  700.0 million senior notes which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations. 
    
  Segment Information Overview.   We have identified three reportable segments according to the nature and economic characteristics of our products as well as the manner in which the information is used internally by the Company s chief operating decision maker to evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions. Our reportable business segments consist of: (1) Lithium and Advanced Materials, (2) Bromine Specialties and (3) Refining Solutions. 
  Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables. Results for 2015 have been recast to reflect the change in segments previously noted. The  All Other  category is comprised of three operating  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

segments that do not fit into any of our core businesses subsequent to the acquisition of Rockwood: minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals, fine chemistry services and metal sulfides. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the sales of the metal sulfides business and the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business. 
  The Corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporate-related items not allocated to the reportable segments. Pension and OPEB service cost (which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period) and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the segments, All Other, and Corporate, whereas the remaining components of pension and OPEB benefits cost or credit ( Non-operating pension and OPEB items ) are included in Corporate. Segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs. 
  The Company s chief operating decision maker uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-recurring or unusual items such as acquisition and integration related costs, utilization of inventory markup, gains or losses on sales of businesses, restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges, non-operating pension and OPEB items and other significant non-recurring items ( adjusted EBITDA ), in a balanced manner and on a segment basis to assess the ongoing performance of the Company s business segments and to allocate resources. In addition, management uses adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performance-based compensation for management and other employees. The Company has reported adjusted EBITDA because management believes it provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income (loss) attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or any other financial measure reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Net Sales 
  For the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net sales of   $2.0 billion  ,   a decrease   of   $123.3 million  , or   6%  , compared to net sales of   $2.1 billion   for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2015  . On January 4, 2016, we closed the sale of the metal sulfides business and on February 1, 2016, we closed the sale of the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business. The divestiture of these businesses reduced net sales by $194.4 million as compared to the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding the impact of the divested businesses noted above, net sales increased by $71.1 million due to $67.8 million of higher volumes due to market demand, and $4.9 million of favorable price impacts partially offset by $1.6 million of unfavorable currency exchange impacts. 
  Gross Profit 
  For the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , our gross profit   increased     $107.2 million  , or   17%  , from the corresponding   2015   period. Gross profit includes charges of $55.3 million in the   nine  -month period ended September 30,   2015   for the utilization of the inventory markup recorded as part of purchase accounting for the acquisition of Rockwood. The divestiture of our metal sulfides and minerals-based flame retardants businesses in the first quarter of 2016 reduced gross profit by $28.9 million as compared to the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2015  . Excluding the inventory markup charges and the impact of divestitures, gross profit increased by $80.8 million, or 11.9%, due primarily to higher overall sales volumes, favorable pricing impacts, and $27.7 million in lower variable and fixed costs. Overall, these factors contributed to a   higher   gross profit margin for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   of   36.8%  ,   up   from   29.6%   in the corresponding period in   2015  . Excluding the inventory markup charges and the impact of divestitures, gross profit margin was 37.4% for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to 34.5% in the corresponding period in   2015  .

The increase is primarily due to a $2.3 million decrease in non-operating pension and OPEB gains and an increase in compensation costs, partially offset by a reduction in SG A costs associated with the divested businesses. As a percentage of net sales, SG A expenses were   12.9%   for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   12.0%   for the corresponding period in   2015  . 
  Research and Development

Other Income, Net 
  Other income, net, for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.7 million   versus   $50.2 million   for the corresponding   2015   period. The change was primarily due to $54.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation gains in 2015. The foreign currency gains were primarily related to cash denominated in U.S. Dollars held by foreign subsidiaries where the European Union Euro serves as the functional currency. This was partially offset by a $2.9 million gain in the fair value of our investment in private equity securities recorded during the   third   quarter of   2016   and $4.4 million in amortization of bridge facility fees and other financing fees related to the acquisition of Rockwood recorded in 2015. 
  Income Tax Expense 
  The effective income tax rate for the first   nine   months of 2016 was   13.8%   compared to   23.2%   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Our effective income tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory income tax rates in the comparative periods primarily due to the impact of earnings from outside the U.S. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   is primarily driven by income of $122.3 million from the sales of businesses with associated tax expense of $6.7 million, that was subject to tax at a rate below our effective tax rate and changes in impacts of earnings from outside the U.S.  
  Equity in Net Income of Unconsolidated Investments 
  Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments was   $44.8 million   for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $20.0 million   in the same period last year. Equity in net income of unconsolidated investments for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2015   includes a   $26.9 million   charge for utilization of fair value adjustments to inventories in connection with the Rockwood acquisition. Excluding this charge, equity in net income of unconsolidated investments decreased by $2.1 million primarily due to the sale of our ownership interest in Magnifin Magnesiaprodukte GmbH during the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . This was partially offset by higher equity income reported by our Refining Solutions segment joint venture Nippon Ketjen Company Limited primarily due to higher sales volumes. 
  (Loss) income from Discontinued Operations 
  (Loss) income from discontinued operations, after income taxes, was   ($357.8) million   for the nine-month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $19.1 million   in the same period last year. The change was primarily due to a non-recurring, non-cash tax charge of $411.3 million related to the change in the Company s assertion over book and tax basis differences for certain entities included in the sale of the Chemetall Surface Treatment business recorded in 2016, no depreciation and amortization expense in the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   because of discontinued operations accounting and a $20.0 million charge of fair value adjustments to inventories in connection with the Rockwood acquisition in 2015, partially offset by favorable sales prices and volumes due to market demand, as well as lower interest expense. 
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  For the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was   $28.9 million   compared to   $16.7 million   in the same period last year. This   increase   of $12.2 million was due primarily to an increase in consolidated income related to our Jordanian joint venture from higher sales volumes. 
  N  et Income Attri  butable to Albemarle Corporation 
  N  et income attributa  ble to Albemarle Corporation     decreased     to     $41.6 million     in the     nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $160.7 million   in the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2015  . The   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2015   includes a $64.4 million charge after income taxes for utilization of fair value adjustments to inventories and the current year includes a non-recurring, non-cash tax charge of $411.3 million related to the decision sell the Chemetall Surface Treatment business and a $115.6 million gain after income taxes on sales of businesses. Excluding these items, net income attributable to Albemarle increased by $112.2 million. The increase was primarily due to higher gross profit associated with stronger business results, a reduction in acquisition and integration costs, lower interest associated with lower debt levels and the favorable impact of the refinancing that was completed on October 15, 2015, and a lower overall effective tax rate, partially offset by $54.1 million of favorable foreign currency translation gains in 2015 related to cash denominated in U.S. Dollars held by foreign subsidiaries where the European Union Euro serves as the functional currency and the impact of the divestitures. 
  Other Comprehensive Income (Loss), Net of Tax 
  Total other comprehensive income (loss), after income taxes, was   $87.3 million   for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   ($324.5) million   for the corresponding period in   2015  . The majority of these amounts were the result of translating our foreign subsidiary financial statements from their local currencies to U.S. Dollars. In the   2016   period, other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation adjustments was   $95.4 million  , mainly as a result of favorable movements in the European Union Euro of approximately $82 million, the Brazilian Real of approximately $14

million, the Korean Won of approximately $7 million, the Japanese Yen of approximately $6 million and a net favorable variance in various other currencies totaling approximately $11 million (each approximately $4 million or less), partially offset by unfavorable movements in the British Pound Sterling of approximately $19 million and the Chinese Renminbi of approximately $5 million. Also included in total other comprehensive income for the   2016   period is a loss of   $10.3 million   in connection with the revaluation of our  700.0 million senior notes which have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in foreign operations. In the   2015   period, other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation adjustments was   $365.8 million  , mainly as a result of unfavorable movements in the European Union Euro of approximately $226 million, the British Pound Sterling of approximately $55 million, the Brazilian Real of approximately $30 million, the Turkish Lira of approximately $12 million, the Korean Won of approximately $10 million, the Chinese Renminbi of approximately $6 million, the South African Rand of approximately $6 million and a net unfavorable variance in various other currencies totaling approximately $20 million (each approximately $5 million or less).

  Segment Information Overview.   Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments is shown in the following tables. Results for 2015 have been recast to reflect the change in segments previously noted. The  All Other  category is comprised of three operating segments that do not fit into any of our core businesses subsequent to the acquisition of Rockwood: minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals, fine chemistry services and metal sulfides. During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the sales of the metal sulfides business and the minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business. 
  The Corporate category is not considered to be a segment and includes corporate-related items not allocated to the reportable segments. Pension and OPEB service cost (which represents the benefits earned by active employees during the period) and amortization of prior service cost or benefit are allocated to the segments, All Other, and Corporate, whereas the remaining components of pension and OPEB benefits cost or credit ( Non-operating pension and OPEB items ) are included in Corporate. Segment data includes intersegment transfers of raw materials at cost and allocations for certain corporate costs. 
  The Company s chief operating decision maker uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, as adjusted on a consistent basis for certain non-recurring or unusual items such as acquisition and integration related costs, utilization of inventory markup, gains or losses on sales of businesses, restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges, non-operating pension and OPEB items and other significant non-recurring items ( adjusted EBITDA ), in a balanced manner and on a segment basis to assess the ongoing performance of the Company s business segments and to allocate resources. In addition, management uses adjusted EBITDA for business planning purposes and as a significant component in the calculation of performance-based compensation for management and other employees. The Company has reported adjusted EBITDA because management believes it provides transparency to investors and enables period-to-period comparability of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a financial measure that is not required by, or presented in accordance with, U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to Net income (loss) attributable to Albemarle Corporation, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP, or any other financial measure reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

  Financial Condition and Liquidity 
  Overview 
  The principal uses of cash in our business generally have been capital investments, funding working capital, acquisitions and repayment of debt. We also make contributions to our defined benefit pension plans, pay dividends to our shareholders and repurchase shares of our common stock. Historically, cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by cash from operations, debt financing and equity issuances. 
  We are continually focused on working capital efficiency particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory. We anticipate that cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, divestitures and long-term borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund capital expenditures and other investing activities, fund pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future. 
  Cash Flow 
  During the first   nine   months of   2016  , cash on hand, cash provided by operations and   $310.6 million   of net proceeds from divestitures funded   $382.7 million   of debt repayments,   $141.3 million   of capital expenditures for plant, machinery and equipment, and dividends to shareholders of   $101.1 million  . Our operations provided   $452.4 million   of cash flows during the first   nine   months of   2016  , as compared to   $316.9 million   for the first   nine   months of   2015  . Our cash from operations included an outflow from working capital changes of   $79.7 million  , primarily due to tax payments made during the year and the increase in receivables from higher sales in certain regions with longer payment terms. Overall, our cash and cash equivalents increased by approximately   $19.9 million   to   $233.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , up from   $213.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  .

Net current assets were   $480.9 million   and   $214.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, with the increase being largely due to the reduction in the current portion of long-term debt using proceeds from divestitures completed in the first quarter of 2016. Included in net current assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is   $119.8 million   and   $312.3 million  , respectively, of assets held for sale, net of related liabilities. Other changes in the components of net current assets are due to the timing of the sale of goods and other normal transactions leading up to the balance sheet dates and are not the result of any policy changes by the Company, nor do they reflect any change in either the quality of our net current assets or our expectation of success in converting net working capital to cash in the normal course of business. 
  Capital expenditures for the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   of   $141.3 million  ,   $15.5 million   of which related to discontinued operations, were associated with property, plant and equipment additions. We expect our capital expenditures to approximate $185 million from continuing operations in   2016   for capacity increases, cost reduction and continuity of operations projects. 
  On June 17, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the Chemetall Surface Treatment business to BASF SE for proceeds of approximately   $3.2 billion   in cash, subject to adjustment with respect to certain pension liabilities, cash, working capital and indebtedness. We intend to use the proceeds to significantly reduce leverage, invest heavily in growth in remaining businesses and return capital to shareholders. In connection with the agreement to sell the Chemetall Surface Treatment business, we have recorded a deferred tax liability of   $411.3 million   related to the outside basis difference of the investment in this business. The sale is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016, at which time, any difference between the sales price and the proportionate carrying value of the interests being sold would be recognized and will become a cash liability. 
  On February 26, 2016, we increased our quarterly dividend rate to   $0.305   per share, a 5% increase from the quarterly rate of $0.29 per share paid in 2015. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our cash and cash equivalents included   $228.9 million   and   $200.7 million  , respectively, held by our foreign subsidiaries. For our continuing operations, the majority of these foreign cash balances are associated with earnings that we have asserted are indefinitely invested and which we plan to use to support our continued growth plans outside the U.S. through funding of capital expenditures, acquisitions, research, operating expenses or other similar cash needs of our foreign operations. As a result of the agreement to sell the Chemetall Surface Treatment business, our assertion of indefinite reinvestment of the earnings of the foreign Chemetall Surface Treatment businesses changed, and resulted in a discrete non-cash charge of   $29.8 million   in 2016. From time to time, we repatriate cash associated with earnings from our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. for normal operating needs through intercompany dividends, but only from subsidiaries whose earnings we have not asserted to be indefinitely invested or whose earnings qualify as  previously taxed income  as defined by the Internal Revenue Code. During the first   nine   months of   2016   and 2015, we repatriated approximately   $27.3 million   and   $122.4 million   of cash, respectively, as part of these foreign cash repatriation activities.  
  While we continue to closely monitor our cash generation, working capital management and capital spending in light of continuing uncertainties in the global economy, we believe that we will continue to have the financial flexibility and capability to opportunistically fund future growth initiatives. Additionally, we anticipate that future capital spending including business acquisitions, share repurchases and other cash outlays should be financed primarily with cash flow provided by operations and cash on hand, with additional cash needed, if any, provided by borrowings. The amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements. 
  Long-Term Debt 
  We currently have the following senior notes outstanding: 

Our senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all our other outstanding senior unsecured indebtedness. The senior notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries. As is customary for such long-term debt instruments, each senior note has terms that allow us to redeem it before its maturity, in whole at any time or in part from time to time, at a redemption price  
  
   45 

     Table of Contents  

equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed, or (ii) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the redemption date on a semi-annual basis using the comparable government rate (as defined in the indentures governing the senior notes) plus between 25 and 40 basis points, depending on the note, plus, in each case, accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption. Holders may require us to purchase such notes at 101% upon a change of control triggering event, as defined in the indentures. The senior notes are subject to typical events of default, including bankruptcy and insolvency events, nonpayment and the acceleration of certain subsidiary indebtedness of $40 million or more caused by a nonpayment default. 
  The Company entered into a new term loan agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (the  Administrative Agent ) and certain other lenders on September 14, 2015 (the  September 2015 Term Loan Agreement ). The September 2015 Term Loan Agreement provided for borrowings under a 364-day term loan facility (the  364-Day Facility ) and a five-year term loan facility (the  Five-Year Facility ). During the   nine-month period ended     September 30, 2016  , we repaid the 364-Day Facility in full and we repaid $81 million of borrowings under the Five-Year Facility, each primarily with proceeds from the sale of the Company s metal sulfides business and the sale of the Company s minerals-based flame retardants and specialty chemicals business, both of which closed in the first quarter of 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate amount outstanding under the Five-Year Facility was $869.0 million, excluding unamortized debt issuance costs. Borrowings under the facilities bear interest equal to, at the option of the Company: (a) the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) plus a margin ranging from 1.000% to 1.875% per annum depending upon the long-term, unsecured, senior, non-credit enhanced debt rating of the Company, or (b) a base rate (defined as the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%; (ii) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by the Administrative Agent as its  prime rate  or (iii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00%) plus a margin of 0.000% to 0.875% per annum depending upon the long-term, unsecured, senior, non-credit enhanced debt rating of the Company. As of   September 30, 2016  , the interest rate on the Five-Year Facility was LIBOR plus 1.375%. 
  Borrowings under the Five-Year Facility are required to be repaid in equal quarterly installments on the last business day of each March, June, September and December, beginning with September 30, 2016, and ending with the last such day to occur prior to the fifth anniversary after initial funding (each a  Payment Date ), in an aggregate principal amount equal to (a) in the case of each Payment Date occurring on or after the first anniversary and prior to the second anniversary of initial funding, 1.25% of the aggregate principal amount of such loans, and (b) in the case of each Payment Date occurring on or after the second anniversary of initial funding, equal to 2.5% of the aggregate principal amount of such loans. As a result of the repayments to the Five-Year Facility noted above, we will not be required to make a quarterly installment until December 31, 2017. On the fifth anniversary after initial funding, any remaining amounts outstanding under the Five-Year Facility become due and payable. Borrowings under the September 2015 Term Loan Agreement are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio requirement that is aligned with the maximum leverage ratio requirement of our February 2014 Credit Agreement. 
  Our revolving, unsecured credit agreement dated as of February 7, 2014, as amended, (the  February 2014 Credit Agreement ) currently provides for borrowings of up to $1.0 billion and matures on February 7, 2020. Borrowings bear interest at variable rates based on the LIBOR for deposits in the relevant currency plus an applicable margin which ranges from 1.000% to 1.700%, depending on the Company s credit rating from Standard   Poor s Ratings Services, Moody s Investors Services and Fitch Ratings. The applicable margin on the facility was 1.300% as of   September 30, 2016  . There were no borrowings outstanding under the February 2014 Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Borrowings under the February 2014 Credit Agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants: (a) consolidated funded debt, as defined in the agreement, must be less than or equal to 3.50 times consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the agreement, which reflects adjustments for certain non-recurring or unusual items such as acquisition and integration related costs, utilization of inventory markup, gains or losses on sales of businesses, restructuring charges, facility divestiture charges and other significant non-recurring items (herein  consolidated adjusted EBITDA  or  adjusted EBITDA ) as of the end of any fiscal quarter; (b) with the exception of certain liens as specified in the agreement, liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured subsidiary indebtedness, other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the February 2014 Credit Agreement, would exceed 20% of consolidated net worth, as defined in the agreement; and (c) with the exception of certain indebtedness as specified in the agreement, subsidiary indebtedness may not exceed the difference between 20% of consolidated net worth, as defined in the agreement, and indebtedness secured by liens permitted under the agreement. On August 15, 2014, certain amendments were made to the February 2014 Credit Agreement which includes, among other things, an increase in the maximum leverage ratio (as described above) from 3.50 to 4.50 for the first four quarters following the completion of the acquisition of Rockwood, stepping down by 0.25 on a quarterly basis thereafter until reaching 3.50.

On May 29, 2013, we entered into agreements to initiate a commercial paper program on a private placement basis under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the  Commercial Paper Notes ) from time-to-time up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any time of $750.0 million. The proceeds from the issuance of the Commercial Paper Notes are used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of other debt of the Company. Our February 2014 Credit Agreement is available to repay the Commercial Paper Notes, if necessary. Aggregate borrowings outstanding under the February 2014 Credit Agreement and the Commercial Paper Notes will not exceed the $1.0 billion current maximum amount available under the February 2014 Credit Agreement. The Commercial Paper Notes may be sold at a discount from par, or alternatively, at par, and bear interest at rates that varies based upon market conditions at the time of issuance. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes vary but may not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The definitive documents relating to the commercial paper program contain customary representations, warranties, default and indemnification provisions. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $400.9 million   of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding bearing a weighted-average interest rate of approximately   1.38%   and a weighted-average maturity of   39 days  . The Commercial Paper Notes are classified as Current portion of long-term debt in our condensed consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  The non-current portion of our long-term debt was   $3.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $3.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , we had the ability to borrow   $599.1 million   under our commercial paper program and the February 2014 Credit Agreement, and   $223.7 million   under other existing lines of credit, subject to various financial covenants under our February 2014 Credit Agreement. We have the ability and intent to refinance our borrowings under our other existing credit lines with borrowings under the February 2014 Credit Agreement, as applicable. Therefore, the amounts outstanding under those credit lines, if any, are classified as long-term debt. We believe that as of   September 30, 2016  , we were, and currently are, in compliance with all of our debt covenants. 
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the normal course of business with customers, vendors and others, we have entered into off-balance sheet arrangements, including bank guarantees and letters of credit, which totaled approximately   $60.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . None of these off-balance sheet arrangements has, or is likely to have, a material effect on our current or future financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. 
  Other Obligations 
  Total expected   2016   contributions to our domestic and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans from continuing and discontinued operations, including our SERP, approximate   $16.6 million  . We may choose to make additional pension contributions in excess of this amount. We have made contributions of   $11.4 million   to our domestic and foreign pension plans (both qualified and nonqualified) during the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  The liability related to uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, recorded in Other noncurrent liabilities totaled   $99.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $101.7 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in Other assets totaled   $50.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $50.9 million   at   December 31, 2015  . We cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments associated with these liabilities for the remainder of   2016   or the next twelve months, and we are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time.  
  We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements regulating the handling, manufacture and use of materials (some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies), the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment. To our knowledge, we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws, regulations, statutes and ordinances. Compliance with existing federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings or our competitive position, but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results. 
  Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund law, and similar state laws, under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party ( PRP ) and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites. Management believes that in cases in which we may have liability as a PRP, our liability for our share of cleanup is de minimis. Further, almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated, studied and in many cases settled. In de minimis situations, our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement, enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a PRP, except for remote contingencies. In other than de minimis PRP matters, our records indicate that unresolved PRP exposures should be immaterial. We accrue and expense our proportionate share of PRP costs. Because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters, we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved PRP sites should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations or financial condition.

Liquidity Outlook 
  We anticipate that cash on hand, cash provided by operating activities, divestitures and borrowings will be sufficient to pay our operating expenses, satisfy debt service obligations, fund any capital expenditures and share repurchases, make pension contributions and pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Our main focus over the next three years, in terms of uses of cash, will be deleveraging to restore our borrowings to more normal levels, capital expenditures for business growth and capturing synergies related to the integration of Rockwood. Additionally, we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets, which may require additional liquidity. 
  Our cash flows from operations may be negatively affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of moderating global economic conditions and reduced capital availability. 
  While we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions, an adverse change in their credit standing could lead them to not honor their contractual credit commitments, decline funding under existing but uncommitted lines of credit, not renew their extensions of credit or not provide new financing. While the global corporate bond and bank loan markets remain strong, periods of elevated uncertainty related to global economic and/or geopolitical concerns may limit efficient access to such markets for extended periods of time. If such concerns heighten, we may incur increased borrowing costs and reduced credit capacity as our various credit facilities mature. When the U.S. Federal Reserve or similar national reserve banks in other countries decide to tighten the monetary supply in response, for example, to improving economic conditions, we may incur increased borrowing costs as interest rates increase on our variable rate credit facilities, as our various credit facilities mature or as we refinance any maturing fixed rate debt obligations.  
  Overall, with generally strong cash-generative businesses and no significant long-term debt maturities before 2019, we believe we have and will maintain a solid liquidity position. 
  We had cash and cash equivalents totaling   $233.6 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , of which   $228.9 million   is held by our foreign subsidiaries. This cash represents an important source of our liquidity and is invested in short-term investments including time deposits and readily marketable securities with relatively short maturities. Substantially all of this cash is held, and intended for use, outside of the U.S. We anticipate that any needs for liquidity within the U.S. in excess of our cash held in the U.S. can be readily satisfied with borrowings under our existing U.S. credit facilities or our commercial paper program. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  For a description of recent accounting pronouncements, see Item 1 Financial Statements   Note 18,  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.  
   
                 Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 

There have been no significant changes in our interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate exposure, marketable securities price risk or raw material price risk from the information we provided in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  We had variable interest rate borrowings of   $1.3 billion   outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , bearing a weighted average interest rate of   1.64%   and representing approximately   38%   of our total outstanding debt. A hypothetical 10% change (approximately   16   basis points) in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately   $2.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . We may enter into interest rate swaps, collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs. 
  Our financial instruments which are subject to foreign currency exchange risk consist of foreign currency forward contracts with an aggregate notional value of   $465.5 million   and with a fair value representing a net liability position of approximately $0.2 million at   September 30, 2016  . Fluctuations in the value of these contracts are generally offset by the value of the underlying exposures being hedged. We conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous 10% change in select foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of   September 30, 2016  , with all other variables held constant. A 10% appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies that we hedge would result in a   increase   of approximately   $14.0 million   in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts. A 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar against these foreign currencies would result in an   decrease   of approximately   $16.3 million   in the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts. The sensitivity of the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of   September 30, 2016  , without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions. When those anticipated transactions are realized, actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods.

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
  No change in internal controls over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) occurred during the third quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
                 Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings. 

We are involved from time to time in legal proceedings of types regarded as common in our business, including administrative or judicial proceedings seeking remediation under environmental laws, such as Superfund, products liability, breach of contract liability and premises liability litigation. Where appropriate, we may establish financial reserves for such proceedings. We also maintain insurance to mitigate certain of such risks. Additional information with respect to this Item 1 is contained in Note 11 to the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
                 Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors. 

While we attempt to identify, manage and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with our business to the extent practical under the circumstances, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. The risk factors set forth in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   describes some of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our results of operations and our financial condition. We do not believe that there have been any material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .
