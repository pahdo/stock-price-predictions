1. Summary of significant accounting policies 
 (a) Basis of preparation and liquidity 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared for Cogint, Inc., a Delaware corporation, formerly known as IDI, Inc., in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding interim financial reporting. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. 
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods, but are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be anticipated for any future interim periods or for the full year ending December 31, 2016. 
 The information included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 Annual Report ). 
 The condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 included herein was derived from the audited financial statements as of that date included in the 2015 Annual Report, but does not include all disclosures including notes required by US GAAP. 
  Reclassifications  
 Certain prior period items, including depreciation and amortization, and promissory notes payable to certain shareholders, have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  
  Principles of consolidation  
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant transactions among the Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated upon consolidation. 
 (b) Recently issued accounting standards 
 In May 2014, Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2014-09 ( ASU 2014-09 ),   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .  The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. On July 9, 2015, FASB approved the proposal to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Early adoption is permitted as of the original effective date of December 15, 2016, and the standard is effective for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein. We do not plan to early adopt ASU 2014-09 and we plan to have a preliminary assessment of its impact on our consolidated financial statements by the end of 2016. 
 In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ),   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , which provides guidance on management s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the impact of adoption of ASU 2014-15 on our consolidated financial statements will be material. 
   In September 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16 ( ASU 2015-16 ),   Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments ,  which replaces the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement period adjustments retrospectively with a requirement that an acquirer recognize adjustments to the provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 requires that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts calculated as if the  
 6 

accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within   those fiscal years. The guidance is to be applied prospectively to adjustments to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date of the guidance, with earlier application permitted for financial statement that have not been issued. We adopted ASU   2015-16 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. We are still evaluating the purchase price alloca  tion related to the acquisition   of Q Interactive, LLC, and we do not expect it will have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statem  ents.   
   
 In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ),   Leases (Topic 842)  , which generally requires companies to recognize operating and financing lease liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets on the balance sheet. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2019 on a modified retrospective basis and early adoption is permitted. We are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 
   
 In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ),   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvement to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting ,  which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, an option to recognize gross share-based compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. This guidance will be effective in the first quarter of 2017, and early adoption is permitted. We early adopted ASU 2016-09 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and it does not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2016,  FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ),    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments ,   which provides guidance for certain cash flow issues, including contingent consideration payments made after a business combination and debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs etc. The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years, and early adoption is permitted. We will evaluate the impact of ASU 2016-15 on our condensed consolidation financial statements in 2017.  
 Except for the ASUs noted above, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, other ASUs are not expected to have a material impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 

2. Loss per share 
 Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the periods. Diluted loss per share reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock and is calculated using the treasury stock method for stock options and unvested shares. Common equivalent shares are excluded from the calculation in the loss periods as their effects would be anti-dilutive. 
 The information related to basic and diluted loss per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is as follows: 

7 

3. Acquisitions  
 The Company records acquisitions pursuant to ASC 805    Business Combinations . We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially with respect to intangible assets. Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited to, future expected cash flows from acquired intangible assets, useful lives and discount rates. Management s estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings. 
  Q Interactive Acquisition  
 To expand and strengthen the Company s business in the consumer marketing industry, on June 8, 2016 (the  Effective Date of Q Interactive Acquisition ), the Company  e  n  t  e  r  e d  i  n  t o  a  n d  c  on  s  u  mm  a  t  e d  t  h e    t  r  a  n  s  ac  ti  on s  c  on  t  e  m  p  l  a  t  e d  b y  a   M  e  m  b  e  r  s  h  i p  I  n  t  e  r  e  s t  P  u  r  c  h  a  s e    A  g  r  ee  m  e  n t with Selling Source, LLC ( Selling Source ), the seller, pursuant to which the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the  Membership Interests ) in Q Interactive, LLC ( Q Interactive ), a Delaware limited liability company (the  Q Interactive Acquisition ). 
 As consideration for the Membership Interests, after adjustment for Q Interactive s net working capital at closing, the Company issued to Selling Source 2,369,190 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0005 per share. Selling Source may receive additional consideration for the Membership Interests if 2016 gross revenue of Q Interactive equals or exceeds $25,000 (the  Earn-out Target ). Such additional consideration, if earned, would be paid in either of the following ways, at the seller s option, no earlier than the one-year anniversary of the closing date (the  Q Interactive Earn-out Shares ): (i) 1,200,000 shares of common stock (subject to adjustment for certain capital events) or (ii) that number of shares of common stock equal to $10,000, in the aggregate, as determined by the volume weighted average price of the common stock for the ten trading days immediately preceding Selling Source s receipt of a statement prepared by the Company stating the Earn-out Target has been achieved. Based on management s preliminary assessment, we concluded that it was extremely likely that Q Interactive would meet the Earn-out Target, and the estimated fair value of the Q Interactive Earn-out Shares is $10,000.  
 The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price allocation and the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed (marked to market), and the resulting amount of goodwill in the Q Interactive Acquisition (the legal and accounting acquiree) at the Effective Date of the Q Interactive Acquisition.  

8 

The intangible assets acquired   in the Q Interactive Acquisition   are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The useful lives for customer relationships, trade names, proprietary technology, databases and non-competition agreements are 10 years, 20 years, 5 years, 5 years and 2 years, respect  ively, and the weighted average useful life for these acquired intangible assets with definite useful lives is 8 years.  
   
 Goodwill from the Q Interactive Acquisition principally relates to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including the assembled workforce and synergies. Goodwill is tax deductible for income tax purposes and was assigned to the Information Services and Performance Marketing reporting segments in the amount of $1,709 and $3,502, respectively (See Note 10 for segment information). 
 The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Q Interactive Acquisition was based on a preliminary valuation and our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. The primary areas of the purchase price that are not yet finalized are related to certain working capital adjustments and contingent consideration. Measurement period adjustments will be applied to the period that the adjustment is identified in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
 Pro forma disclosure for Q Interactive Acquisition 
 The following table includes the pro forma results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of the combined companies as though the Q Interactive Acquisition had been completed as of the beginning of the periods being presented. 

(1)    
 
   For the comparative pro forma results for three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we also assumed the Fluent Acquisition (as defined below) had been completed as of the beginning of the periods being presented.     

The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only, and may not necessarily reflect our future results of operations or what the results of operations would have been had we owned and operated each company as of the beginning of the periods presented. 
  Fluent Acquisition  
 To accelerate the Company s strategy to apply its next generation data fusion technology to not only the risk management industry, but also as an advanced data analytics platform to the consumer marketing industry, on December 8, 2015 (the  Effective Date of Fluent Acquisition ), the Company completed the acquisition of Fluent, Inc. (the  Fluent Acquisition ), pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Fluent Merger Agreement ). 
 On December 9, 2015, Fluent Acquisition II, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, the surviving entity of the Fluent Acquisition, changed its name to Fluent, LLC ( Fluent ). Cogint, Inc. is the legal and accounting acquirer in the Fluent Acquisition.  
 9 

Pursuant to the Fluent Merger Agreement, the Company acquired 10  0% of the outstanding stock of Fluent from the   s  ellers for the following consideration: (i) 15,001,850 shares of the Company s common stock, par value $0.0005, with the fair value of $123.8 million, determined by multiplying the Company s market stock pric  e by the total shares of common stock, and (ii) approximately $99.3 million in cash.  The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation and the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed (marked to market), and the resulting a  mount of goodwill in the Fluent   Acquisition   at the Effective Date of Fluent Acquisition.  

The intangible assets acquired in the Fluent Acquisition are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. The useful lives for customer relationships, trade names, domain names, proprietary technology, databases and non-competition agreements are 7 years, 20 years, 20 years, 5 years, 10 years, and 5 years, respectively, and the weighted average useful life for these acquired intangible assets is 10 years. 
 Goodwill from the Fluent Acquisition principally relates to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, including the assembled workforce and synergies. Goodwill is not tax deductible for income tax purposes and was assigned to the Information Services and Performance Marketing reporting segments of $37,185 and $118,461, respectively. 

4. Discontinued operations 
 On June 30, 2015, in connection with the Company s strategy to focus primarily on the big data and analytics sector via its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company s Board of Directors approved a plan under which the Company discontinued the operations of its Chinese- and British Virgin Islands-based subsidiaries (collectively, the  Advertising Business ). The Company recognized the transactions in accordance with ASC Topic 205-20,   Discontinued Operations  . The Company has disposed of all assets and liabilities related to its Advertising Business, by the disposal of its equity interests in the Advertising Business to an independent third party in 2015 for $0. 
 10 

The following financial information presents the results of operations of the Advertising Business for the three and   nine   months ended   September   30, 2015.  

Loss on disposal of discontinued operations was composed of the following items: 

11 

5. Intangible assets, net  
 Intangible assets other than goodwill consist of the following: 

The amount associated with Purchased IP and capitalized litigation costs, included in the Information Services segment, is mainly related to the intellectual property purchased by Company subsidiary The Best One, Inc. ( TBO ) from Ole Poulsen ( Purchased IP ) pursuant to the Intellectual Property Purchase Agreement dated October 14, 2014 and related legal and other costs incurred and paid in defending the Company s claims to the Purchased IP against TransUnion Risk and Alternative Data Solutions, Inc. As of September 30, 2016, the Company wrote off the remaining balance of Purchased IP and capitalized litigation costs of $4,055, which was reflected in general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as a result of an unfavorable ruling in relation to the litigation. See Note 12  Commitment and contingencies  for additional information regarding the litigation involving the Purchased IP. 
   
 The gross amount associated with software developed for internal use mainly represents capitalized costs of internally developed software. The amounts relating to acquired proprietary technology, customer relationships, trade names, domain names, acquired databases, and non-competition agreements all represent the fair values of intangible assets acquired as a result of the Fluent Acquisition and the Q Interactive Acquisition. 
   
 Amortization expenses of $3,333 and $12 were included in depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $8,726 and $40 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, intangible assets of $3,325, included into the gross amounts of software developed for internal use, have not started amortization. These intangible assets will start to amortize when they are put into use. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, estimated amortization expenses related to the Company s intangible assets for the remainder of 2016 through 2021 and thereafter are as follows: 
 12 

6. Goodwill 
 Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. As of September 30, 2016, the balance of goodwill includes $5,227 as a result of the acquisition of Interactive Data, LLC ( Interactive Data ) effective on October 2, 2014, $155,645 as a result of the Fluent Acquisition effective on December 8, 2015, and $5,211 as a result of the Q Interactive Acquisition effective on June 8, 2016. The following table presents the changes in the amount of goodwill for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

In accordance with ASC Topic 350,   Intangibles - Goodwill and Other  , goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that its fair value exceeds the carrying value. The measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test is October 1. 
 As of September 30, 2016, there are no events or changes in circumstances to indicate that goodwill is impaired. 

7. Income taxes 
 The Company is subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States.  Our tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items arising in that quarter. In each quarter, we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated annual tax rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment in that quarter.   
   
 The Company s effective income tax rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate  for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the slight difference is mainly the result of the valuation allowance applied against the Company s deferred tax assets, state income taxes, and nondeductible expenses. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the difference was primarily due to changes in the valuation allowance applied against the Company s deferred tax assets. 
   
 Deferred income taxes should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. On a periodic basis, management evaluates and determines the amount of valuation allowance required and adjusts such valuation allowance accordingly.  
 In accordance with the provisions of ASC 740 -10, the Company records a liability for uncertain tax positions when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has no liabilities for uncertain tax positions. The Company continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings. All of the Company s income tax filings remain open for tax examinations. 
   
 13 

8. Common stock, preferred stock and warrants 
 Common stock

The change in the number of outstanding shares of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a result of the following issuances: 

On February 22, 2016, the Company s Series B Non-voting Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the  Series B Preferred ), 450,962 shares in total, automatically converted into 22,548,100 shares of the Company s common stock, by multiplying each such share of Series B Preferred by 50, pursuant to the Company s Series B Preferred certificate of designation.

 Treasury stock 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company held 61,685 shares in treasury, with a cost of $305. This increase in treasury stock was due to shares that were withheld to pay withholding taxes upon the vesting of RSUs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

9. Share-based payments 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company maintains two share-based incentive plans: the 2008 Share Incentive Plan (the  2008 Plan ), which was carried forward as a result of the TBO Merger effective on March 21, 2015 and the Cogint, Inc. 2015 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2015 Plan ), which was approved during the annual meeting of stockholders on June 2, 2015, which authorized the issuance of 2,500,000 shares of common stock. The 2015 Plan was amended on June 3, 2016 at the Company s annual meeting of stockholders which approved an increase of the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance under the 2015 Plan  to 12,500,000. The primary purpose of the 2015 Plan is to attract, retain, reward and motivate certain individuals by providing them with an opportunity to acquire or increase a proprietary interest in the Company and to incentivize them to expend maximum effort for the growth and success of the Company, so as to strengthen the mutuality of the interests between such individuals and the stockholders of the Company.  
 As of September 30, 2016, there were 180,568 and 5,894,361 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 2008 Plan and the 2015 Plan, respectively.

(2)    
 
 As discussed in Note 8, the increase in treasury stock was due to shares withheld to pay statutory withholding taxes upon the vesting of RSUs during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    

 The Company recognized compensation expenses (included in sales and marketing expenses, general and administrative expenses, and discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, and intangible assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets) for these RSUs of $7,615 and $1,547 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $22,561 and $4,090 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The fair value of the RSUs was estimated using the market value of the Company s common stock on the date of grant, which was equivalent to the closing price of the common stock on the grant date. 
 As of September 30, 2016, unrecognized share-based compensation expenses associated with the granted RSUs amounted to $79,622, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.7 years.

The Company does not allocate interest expense or income taxes to its segments. 

11. Related party transactions

 Earn-out Shares 
 On March 11, 2016, the Company issued 900,108 Common Earn-out Shares to Frost Gamma, and 1,800,220 Series A Earn-out Shares to certain investors (which were subsequently converted to 1,800,220 shares of common stock), including 567,069 shares to Grander Holdings, Inc. 401K, an entity owned by Michael Brauser, the Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, upon a determination by the Board of Directors that certain financial targets had been achieved as set forth in the TBO Merger Agreement.

(b) Contingency 
   
   Other than as described below, the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceeding, investigation or claim which, in the opinion of the management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Legal fees associated with such legal proceedings, are expensed as incurred. For capitalized Purchased IP litigation costs, as  
 18 

discussed in Note 5, th  e Company has written off the balance into   general and administrative expenses   during the three months ended September 30, 2016.     We review legal proceedings and claims on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance, including ASC 450, when   making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of   the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. To estimate whether a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavor  able outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present infor  mation, we determined that there were no matters that required an accru  al as of the balance sheet date  , September 30, 2016  .   The Company estimates that adverse rulings in pending litigation matters could result in a possible loss of   between $3  ,000   and $6  ,00  0  .  
   
 On October 27, 2014, TransUnion Risk and Alternative Data Solutions, Inc. ( TRADS ) filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment against Interactive Data, among other parties, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Florida (the  Court ), regarding a dispute over ownership of certain intellectual property to which both TRADS and Company subsidiary TBO have asserted competing ownership claims. TBO asserted that it purchased this intellectual property from Ole Poulsen ( Poulsen ), the Company s Chief Science Officer ( Purchased IP ). TRADS has since dropped Interactive Data as a party, and added TBO and Ole Poulsen. On June 10, 2015, over TRADS  objections, the Court granted TBO s motion to expand the scope of discovery to include, among other things, whether TRADS is a good faith purchaser of any of the Purchased IP, free of any fraud or misconduct by or on behalf of TRADS, and whether there was a fraud on the Court by TRADS. On February 22, 2016, TBO and Mr. Poulsen filed a motion for summary judgment seeking judgment in their favor on all claims based upon, among other things, TRADS having committed a fraud on the Court. On April 20, 2016, the Court denied the motion for summary judgment. Trial took place on May 16 and 17, 2016 and June 15, 22-24 and 27, 2016.  The parties submitted post-trial memoranda to the Court on July 12, 2016.   
   
 On August 18, 2016, the Court entered a trial order ( Trial Order ) and final judgment (the  Final Judgment ) in favor of TRADS finding the Purchased IP is owned by TRADS, and ordering TBO and Poulsen to turn over all copies of the Purchased IP. The Court also ordered TBO to pay TRADS  attorneys  fees and costs, in an amount to be determined at a later time by the Court.  
   
 On October 7, 2016, TRADS filed a motion seeking its attorneys  fees and costs. A hearing was initially set on this motion for October 18, 2016, and then continued until November 15, 2016. TBO intends to file an opposition to the attorneys  fee motion and/or the bill of costs.        
   
 The Company, TBO and Poulsen have appealed the Court s ruling to the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida ( Federal District Court ), and on October 11, 2016, filed a motion for stay of the Final Judgment pending appeal in the Federal District Court. By stipulation of the parties, TRADS agreed not to enforce the turnover of the Purchased IP until at least October 27, 2016, while the stay motion is briefed. On October 25, 2016, the Company, TBO and Poulsen filed an emergency motion for an interim stay of the injunction until the stay motion filed October 11, 2016 could be resolved. The Federal District Court granted the interim stay request and also set a hearing for the October 11, 2016 stay motion, which will be held on November 8, 2016. 
   
 As a result of the Trial Order and Final Judgment, as of September 30, 2016, the Company has written off $4,055 of intangible assets for both the Purchased IP and capitalized legal costs incurred and paid in defending the claims. An adverse ruling on the award of attorneys  fees and costs could have an immediate near-term impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. As of the date hereof, this case is ongoing.   
   
 On October 23, 2014, TRADS filed a Complaint and Motion for Temporary Injunction, in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court in and for Palm Beach County, Florida, against James Reilly, then President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, seeking relief for alleged violation of a noncompetition agreement. On February 5, 2015, after the presentation of TRADS  case, the court denied TRADS  motion for a temporary injunction to prohibit Mr. Reilly from continuing employment with TBO. TRADS appealed that order, and on December 2, 2015, the Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed the order denying the temporary injunction and remanded for Mr. Reilly to present his case opposing the preliminary injunction. The evidentiary hearing on TRADS  motion took place on May 4 and 5, 2016. On July 1, 2016, a temporary injunction was entered against Mr. Reilly. On July 15, 2016, Mr. Reilly filed a notice of appeal, appealing the trial court s injunction order to the Fourth District Court of Appeal. On August 9, 2016, the Supreme Court of Florida denied Mr. Reilly s petition for discretionary review. On October 3, 2016, Mr. Reilly filed an answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaim asserting claims against TRADS for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. TRADS  response to the counterclaim is currently due on November 10, 2016. On October 5, 2016, the Fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court s injunction order. An adverse ruling could have an immediate near-term impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. As of the date of this report, this case is ongoing. 
   
 19 

On July 28, 2015, TRADS filed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction in the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, against Surya   Challa, Vice President of Technology of TBO, seeking relief for an alleged violation of a noncompetition agreement. The hearing on TRADS  Motion for Preliminary Injunction was held on February 19, 2016.   On March 23, 2016, the court denied TRADS  motion fo  r preliminary injunction. On April 22, 2016, TRADS filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the trial court s order denying the motion for preliminary injunction.     That appeal is still pending. On September 23, 2016, the district court judge entered an or  der staying the case pending appeal.   An adverse ruling could have an immediate near-term impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. As of the date of this report, this case is ongoing.  
   
 On August 10, 2016, the Company filed a lawsuit against TransUnion and related parties alleging tortious interference with its prospective business relationship with Datamyx, LLC ( Datamyx ). The complaint was amended on October 18, 2016. The Company alleges that it was in negotiations to acquire Datamyx, and a definitive transaction was imminent, when TransUnion interfered with the proposed Datamyx acquisition solely as an act of malice in order to damage the Company. As a result of the interference, Datamyx abruptly terminated negotiations with the Company and was ultimately acquired by another suitor. As of the date hereof, this case is ongoing. 
   
 In addition to the foregoing, we may be involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot assure you that the ultimate resolution of any legal or administrative proceeding or dispute will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of   Financial Cond  ition and Results of Operations.  
 Executive Overview 
 You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ( PSLRA ), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the  Exchange Act ), about our expectations, beliefs, or intentions regarding our business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies, the outcome of litigation, or prospects. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends, or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as the disclosures made in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed on March 18, 2016, and other filings we make with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements, except as required by law. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbor provisions of PSLRA. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance.

 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
 Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon cogint s condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( US GAAP ). The preparation of these financial statements requires cogint to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, cogint evaluates its estimates, including those related to bad debts, income taxes, and contingencies. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Use and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
 Management evaluates the financial performance of our business on a variety of key indicators, including adjusted EBITDA.  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure equal to net loss, the most directly comparable financial measure based on US GAAP, plus net loss from discontinued operations, interest expense, income tax (benefit) expenses, depreciation and amortization, share-based payments, and other adjustments, as noted in the table below.  

We present adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our operating performance because we believe it provides useful information to our investors as it eliminates the impact of certain items that we do not consider indicative of our cash operations and ongoing operating performance. In addition, we use it as an integral part of our internal reporting to measure the performance of our reportable segments, evaluate the performance of our senior management and measure the operating strength of our business. 
 Adjusted EBITDA is a measure frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties in their evaluation of the operating performance of companies similar to ours and is an indicator of the operational strength of our business. Adjusted EBITDA eliminates the uneven effect across all reportable segments of considerable amounts of non-cash depreciation and amortization and the non-cash effect of share-based payments. 
   Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to be a performance measure that should be regarded as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, either operating income or net income as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure  
 23 

of liquidity. The way we measure adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies, and may not be identical to corresponding measures used in our various agreements.  
 Results of Operations 
 For accounting purposes, IDI Holdings, LLC was the accounting acquirer, and acquired Tiger Media, Inc. ( Tiger Media ), now known as Cogint, Inc., on March 21, 2015. As such, only results of operations during the period after March 22, 2015 of Tiger Media are included into the condensed consolidated financial statements of cogint for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company disposed of all assets and liabilities related to its Chinese and British Virgin Islands based subsidiaries (collectively, the  Advertising Business ) in 2015, and the operating results of the Advertising Business for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were reflected as discontinued operations. 
   
 On December 8, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Fluent, LLC ( Fluent ) (the  Fluent Acquisition ). The results of operations of Fluent are included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. On June 8, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Q Interactive, LLC ( Q Interactive ) (the  Q Interactive Acquisition ). The results of operations of Q Interactive beginning on June 8, 2016 are included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 Revenue.  Total revenue increased $51.2 million to $52.2 million, and $129.3 million to $132.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from $1.0 million and $3.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase was mainly attributable to the Fluent Acquisition effective on December 8, 2015 and the Q Interactive Acquisition effective on June 8, 2016. Revenue generated from our Information Services segment and Performance Marketing segment were $14.8 million and $37.4 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, versus $1.0 million and $0 million, respectively, for the three months ended September 30, 2015; while revenue generated from these two segments were $39.2 million and $93.4 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, versus $3.3 million and $0 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Gross profit.  Gross profit margin was 24% and 24% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 26% and 46% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The decrease in gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was mainly the result of the following:  

In the Information Services segment, gross profit as a percentage of revenue is impacted by several factors, including increases in transactional-based data costs, timing and entry into flat-fee data licensing agreements, the mix of those data costs, changes in channels of distribution, sales volume, pricing strategies, and fluctuations in sales of integrated third-party products. As we ingested and released additional data sets in our product offering, increasing the overall breadth and depth of our products, we incurred an increase in the cost of revenues relative to our current sales. As the construct of our data costs is a flat-fee, unlimited usage model, we expect that our gross profit margin will increase as a percentage of sales in our Information Services segment over the coming quarters.     

In our Performance Marketing segment, as a result of the Fluent Acquisition, we generated a lower gross profit margin compared to the Company s overall ratio for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We had no related results of operations in the Performance Marketing segment during the corresponding periods in 2015.     

 Historically, the relative mix of revenue derived from our Performance Marketing and Information Services segment produces a consolidated average gross margin between 26% and 32%. Historically, at scale, the Information Services segment will trend with average gross margins between 70% and 85%. As a result, we expect our combined gross margin to increase over the next twelve months as our Information Services revenue begins to scale.  
 Sales and marketing expenses.  Sales and marketing expenses increased $3.2 million to $3.7 million, and $8.5 million to $10.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from $0.5 million and $1.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase was mainly a result of the Fluent Acquisition and the expansion of our sales organization. Sales and marketing expenses consist of marketing and promotion, salaries and benefits, traveling expenses, share-based compensation expenses, and transportation and other expenses, incurred by our sales team, which are expected to increase in the future following the growth of revenue and the Company s continuous efforts to expand its sales organization. Included in sales and marketing expenses was non-cash share-based compensation expenses of $0.7 million and $1.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, versus $0 million and $0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
   General and administrative expenses.  General and administrative expenses increased $13.5 million to $17.7 million, and $34.5 million to $44.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from $4.2 million and $9.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the   
 24 

amounts mainly consisted of non-cash share-based payments of $6.7 million and $1.  7     million,   write-off of Purchased IP and capitalized litigation costs of $4.1 million and $0 million,   professional   fees of $  1.7   million and $  1.4   million, and employee salaries and benefits of $  3  .  2   million and $0.  6   million, respec  tively. For the nine   months ended   September   30, 2016 and 2015, the amounts mainly consisted of non-  cash share-based payments of $20.2 million   and $3  .  6     million,   write-off of Purchased IP and capitalized litigation costs of $4.1 million and $0 million,   professional fees of $  5.2   million and $  3.0   million,     acquisition-related costs of $0.  4 million and $0.4   million, and employee salaries and benefits   of $  8.  4   million and $  1.6   million, respectively.  
 Depreciation and amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $3.5 million to $3.5 million, and $9.0 million to $9.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization in 2016 was mainly attributable to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the Fluent Acquisition and the Q Interactive Acquisition.  
 Interest expense, net.  Interest expense, net, of $1.9 million and $5.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, represented the interest expenses and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the term loan in the amount of $45.0 million ( Term Loan ) and promissory notes payable to certain stockholders in the amount of $10 million ( Promissory Notes ), pursuant to agreements entered in December 2015 in connection with the Fluent Acquisition, with an aggregate long-term debt balance, including the current portion of long-term debt, of $49.9 million as of September 30, 2016.  
 Net loss from continuing operations . For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a loss from continuing operations of $9.7 million and $4.4 million, including $7.3 million and $1.7 million of non-cash share-based payments, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had a loss from continuing operations of $23.7 million and $9.9 million, including $21.9 million and $3.7 million of non-cash share-based payments, respectively. In addition, $4.5 million and $11.5 million of income tax benefit arising primarily from the reduction of our net deferred tax liabilities were recorded for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, versus $0.1 million income tax benefits and $0.1 million income tax expenses recorded for the corresponding periods in 2015, respectively.  
 Net loss from discontinued operations attributable to cogint . As a result of the plan to discontinue the Advertising Business in 2015, a net loss from discontinued operations attributable to cogint of $0.4 million and $42.0 million was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. There were no discontinued operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
 Net loss attributable to cogint.  A net loss of $9.7 million and $23.7 million was recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, versus $4.8 million and $51.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, as a result of the foregoing.  
 Effect of Inflation 
 The rates of inflation experienced in recent years have had no material impact on our financial statements. We attempt to recover increased costs by increasing prices for our services, to the extent permitted by contracts and competition. 
 Liquidity and Capital Resources 
 Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.4 million, which was mainly due to the operating income of $3.6 million, after the adjustments of non-cash items of $27.3 million. Net cash used in operating activities of $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was mainly attributable to net loss from continuing operations of $9.9 million.  
 Cash flows (used in) provided by investing activities . Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $9.5 million, which was mainly due to an aggregate of $8.0 million of capitalized litigation costs and software developed for internal use. Net cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $0.5 million was mainly due to the cash proceeds of $3.6 million as a result of the reverse acquisition of Tiger Media on March 21, 2015, which was offset by the capitalized litigation costs and software developed for internal use of $2.1 million, and the purchase of property and equipment and intangible assets of $0.9 million.  
 Cash flows provided by financing activities.  Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.0 million, which was mainly due to the net proceeds from the registered direct offering of $4.7 million in May 2016, which was offset by the repayments of long-term debt of $1.7 million. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $9.4 million was the result of the net proceeds from a registered direct offering to an institutional investor in July 2015.  
 25 

As of   September   30, 2016, the Company had material commitments under non-cancellable data licensing agreements of $  14.9   million. For the   nine months ended September   30, 2016, the Company funded its operations through the use of available cash.  
 The Company reported net loss of $9.7 million and $23.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to $4.8 million and $51.9 million for the corresponding periods in 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $108.8 million. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $10.4 million, of which, $8.1 million was held by Fluent, a decrease of $3.1 million from $13.5 million as of December 31, 2015. Based on projections of growth in revenue and operating results in the coming year, the Company believes that it will have sufficient cash resources to finance its operations and expected capital expenditures for the next twelve months. Subject to revenue growth, the Company may have to continue to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity and/or debt, which, if the Company is able to obtain, will have the effect of diluting stockholders. Any equity or debt financings, if available at all, may be on terms which are not favorable to the Company. If the Company s operations do not generate positive cash flow in the upcoming year, or if it is not able to meet the debt covenants specified in the Credit Agreement, as amended, or if it is not able to obtain additional equity or debt financing on terms and conditions acceptable to it, if at all, it may be unable to implement its business plan, or even continue its operations. 
 The Company may explore the possible acquisition of businesses, products and/or technologies that are complementary to its existing business. The Company is continuing to identify and prioritize additional technologies, which it may wish to develop internally or through licensing or acquisition from third parties. While the Company may engage from time to time in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions, there can be no assurances that any such acquisitions will be made or that the Company will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business. In order to finance such acquisitions and working capital, it may be necessary for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings. Any equity or debt financings, if available at all, may be on terms which are not favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to stockholders. 
   
  We financed approximately $55.0 million of the cash portion of the purchase price of the Fluent Acquisition with the proceeds from the Term Loan and other indebtedness described herein. As of September 30, 2016, the Term Loan has an outstanding balance of $43.7 million and other indebtedness totaled $10.9 million in the aggregate. All obligations under the Term Loan mature on December 8, 2020 and our other indebtedness is due in 2021. The Credit Agreement governing the Term Loan contains restrictive covenants which impose limitations on the way we conduct our business, including limitations on the amount of additional debt we are able to incur and restricts our ability to make certain investments and other restricted payments, including certain intercompany payments. Fluent, the borrower under the Credit Agreement, entered into a Limited Consent and Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement dated June 8, 2016 and No.2 to Credit Agreement dated September 30, 2016 (collectively, the  Amendments ). The Amendments, among other things, modify certain covenant provisions set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Limited Consent and Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement also requires the Company to deliver to the administrative agent, on or prior to October 7, 2016, (i) amended and restated warrants amending the strike price of the warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of common stock, dated December 8, 2015, currently held by the Administrative Agent (the  Existing Warrants ), from $8.00 per share to $5.08 per share, and (ii) new warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock ( New Warrants ) on terms and conditions substantially similar to the Existing Warrants, as amended and restated, with a per share strike price also equal to $5.08. The restrictive covenants in the Credit Agreement, as amended, may limit our strategic and financing options and our ability to return capital to our stockholders through dividends or stock buybacks. Furthermore, we still may need to incur additional debt to meet future financing needs.   
 The Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain and comply with certain financial and other covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with such financial or other covenants. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness, which would materially adversely affect our financial health if we are unable to access sufficient funds to repay all the outstanding amounts. Moreover, if we are unable to meet our debt obligations as they come due, we could be forced to restructure or refinance such obligations, seek additional equity financing or sell assets, which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms, or at all. In addition, the Credit Agreement includes certain mandatory prepayment provisions, including annual prepayments of the Term Loan with a portion of our excess cash flow. As long as the Term Loan remains outstanding, the restrictive covenants and mandatory prepayment provisions could impair our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies or obtain additional funding. At September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the Credit Agreement. 
 26 

Contractual Obligations  
 As of September 30, 2016, there were no material changes in our commitment under contractual obligations as disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report. 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
 As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
 We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes. To date, we have not used derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of our market risk exposures. We have also not used, nor do we intend to use, derivatives for trading or speculative purposes. 
   
 Interest Rate Risk 
   
 We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates. Our investments are considered cash equivalents and primarily consist of money market mutual funds. As of September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.4 million. The carrying amount of our cash and cash equivalents reasonably approximates fair value, due to the fact that we can redeem such investment freely. The primary objectives of our investment activities are the preservation of capital, the fulfillment of liquidity needs and the fiduciary control of cash and investments. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. Our investments are exposed to market risk due to a fluctuation in interest rates, which may affect our interest income and the fair market value of our investments. Due to the short-term nature of our investment portfolio, we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be materially affected by a sudden change in market interest rates. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, we have long-term debt, including the current portion of long-term debt, in aggregate of $49.9 million. Our Term Loan accrues interest at LIBOR (with a floor of 0.5%) plus 10.5% per annum, payable in cash, plus an additional 1.0% per annum payable, at the Company s election, in-kind or in cash. Interest under the Term Loan is payable monthly, including monthly compounding of PIK interest. In addition, we also have Promissory Notes of $10.0 million in total with a rate of interest of 10% per annum, which interest is capitalized monthly by adding to the outstanding principal amount. The fair value of our debt will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. 
   
 A hypothetical 10% increase in interest rates relative to our current interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of all of our outstanding long-term debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect operating results and cash flows, because of the variable rate nature of the Term Loan. A hypothetical 10% increase or decrease in overall interest rates as of September 30, 2016 would result in an impact to interest expense for the next twelve months by $0.5 million. 
   
     Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
 Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
 Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.  
 Based the evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.  

27 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  
   
 28 

PART II - OTHE  R INFORMATION  
     Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
   
 Other than as described below, the Company is not currently a party to any legal proceeding, investigation or claim which, in the opinion of the management, is likely to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Legal fees associated with such legal proceedings, are expensed as incurred. For capitalized Purchased IP litigation costs, the Company has written off the balance into general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We review legal proceedings and claims on an ongoing basis and follow appropriate accounting guidance, including ASC 450, when making accrual and disclosure decisions. We establish accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and we disclose the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for our financial statements to not be misleading. To estimate whether a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income, we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of the loss. We do not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated. Based upon present information, we determined that there were no matters that required an accrual as of the balance sheet date, September 30, 2016. The Company estimates that adverse rulings in pending litigation matters could result in a possible loss of between $3.0 million and $6.0 million. 
   
 On October 27, 2014, TransUnion Risk and Alternative Data Solutions, Inc. ( TRADS ) filed a Complaint for Declaratory Judgment against Interactive Data, among other parties, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of Florida (the  Court ), regarding a dispute over ownership of certain intellectual property to which both TRADS and Company subsidiary TBO have asserted competing ownership claims. TBO asserted that it purchased this intellectual property from Ole Poulsen ( Poulsen ), the Company s Chief Science Officer ( Purchased IP ). TRADS has since dropped Interactive Data as a party, and added TBO and Ole Poulsen. On June 10, 2015, over TRADS  objections, the Court granted TBO s motion to expand the scope of discovery to include, among other things, whether TRADS is a good faith purchaser of any of the Purchased IP, free of any fraud or misconduct by or on behalf of TRADS, and whether there was a fraud on the Court by TRADS. On February 22, 2016, TBO and Mr. Poulsen filed a motion for summary judgment seeking judgment in their favor on all claims based upon, among other things, TRADS having committed a fraud on the Court. On April 20, 2016, the Court denied the motion for summary judgment. Trial took place on May 16 and 17, 2016 and June 15, 22-24 and 27, 2016.  The parties submitted post-trial memoranda to the Court on July 12, 2016.   
   
 On August 18, 2016, the Court entered a trial order ( Trial Order ) and final judgment (the  Final Judgment ) in favor of TRADS finding the Purchased IP is owned by TRADS, and ordering TBO and Poulsen to turn over all copies of the Purchased IP. The Court also ordered TBO to pay TRADS  attorneys  fees and costs, in an amount to be determined at a later time by the Court.  
   
 On October 7, 2016, TRADS filed a motion seeking its attorneys  fees and costs. A hearing was initially set on this motion for October 18, 2016, and then continued until November 15, 2016. TBO intends to file an opposition to the attorneys  fee motion and/or the bill of costs.        
   
 The Company, TBO and Poulsen have appealed the Court s ruling to the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida ( Federal District Court ), and on October 11, 2016, filed a motion for stay of the Final Judgment pending appeal in the Federal District Court. By stipulation of the parties, TRADS agreed not to enforce the turnover of the Purchased IP until at least October 27, 2016, while the stay motion is briefed. On October 25, 2016, the Company, TBO and Poulsen filed an emergency motion for an interim stay of the injunction until the stay motion filed October 11, 2016 could be resolved. The Federal District Court granted the interim stay request and also set a hearing for the October 11, 2016 stay motion, which will be held on November 8, 2016. 
   
 As a result of the Trial Order and Final Judgment, as of September 30, 2016, the Company has written off $4.1 million of intangible assets for both the Purchased IP and capitalized legal costs incurred and paid in defending the claims. An adverse ruling on the award of attorneys  fees and costs could have an immediate near-term impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. As of the date hereof, this case is ongoing.   
   
   On October 23, 2014, TRADS filed a Complaint and Motion for Temporary Injunction, in the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit Court in and for Palm Beach County, Florida, against James Reilly, then President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, seeking relief for alleged violation of a noncompetition agreement. On February 5, 2015, after the presentation of TRADS  case, the court denied TRADS  motion for a temporary injunction to prohibit Mr. Reilly from continuing employment with TBO. TRADS appealed that order, and on December 2, 2015, the Fourth District Court of Appeal reversed the order denying the temporary injunction and remanded for Mr. Reilly to present his case opposing the preliminary injunction. The evidentiary hearing on TRADS  motion took place on May 4 and 5, 2016. On July 1, 2016, a temporary injunction was entered against Mr. Reilly. On July 15, 2016, Mr. Reilly filed a notice of appeal, appealing the trial court s injunction order to the Fourth District Court of Appeal. On August 9, 2016, the Supreme Court of Florida denied Mr. Reilly s petition for discretionary review. On October 3, 2016, Mr. Reilly filed an answer, affirmative defenses, and counterclaim asserting claims against TRADS for fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation. TRADS

response to the counterclaim is currently due on   November 10  , 2016. On October 5, 2016, the Fourth District Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court s injunct  ion order.   An adverse ruling could have an immediate near-term impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. As of the date of this report, this case is ongoing.  
   
 On July 28, 2015, TRADS filed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction in the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, against Surya Challa, Vice President of Technology of TBO, seeking relief for an alleged violation of a noncompetition agreement. The hearing on TRADS  Motion for Preliminary Injunction was held on February 19, 2016. On March 23, 2016, the court denied TRADS  motion for preliminary injunction. On April 22, 2016, TRADS filed a notice of appeal seeking review of the trial court s order denying the motion for preliminary injunction. That appeal is still pending. On September 23, 2016, the district court judge entered an order staying the case pending appeal. An adverse ruling could have an immediate near-term impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. As of the date of this report, this case is ongoing. 
   
 On August 10, 2016, the Company filed a lawsuit against TransUnion and related parties alleging tortious interference with its prospective business relationship with Datamyx, LLC ( Datamyx ). The complaint was amended on October 18, 2016. The Company alleges that it was in negotiations to acquire Datamyx, and a definitive transaction was imminent, when TransUnion interfered with the proposed Datamyx acquisition solely as an act of malice in order to damage the Company. As a result of the interference, Datamyx abruptly terminated negotiations with the Company and was ultimately acquired by another suitor. As of the date hereof, this case is ongoing. 
   
 In addition to the foregoing, we may be involved in litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of business. We do not believe that the ultimate resolution of any such matters will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. However, the results of such matters cannot be predicted with certainty and we cannot assure you that the ultimate resolution of any legal or administrative proceeding or dispute will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth in our Annual Report on 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 Annual Report ), filed on March 18, 2016, the occurrence of any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our actual results. 
 There have been no material changes to the Risk Factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
 On September 16, 2016, the Company issued 2,500 shares of common stock to a vendor of the Company as additional consideration for services rendered.  
 The issuance of the foregoing securities were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ) afforded by Section 4(a)(2) thereof as an issuance not involving a public offering. The securities issued in these transactions are restricted and may not be resold except pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act or pursuant to a valid exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
