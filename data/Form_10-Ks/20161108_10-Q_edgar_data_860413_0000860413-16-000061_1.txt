  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(1) 
    Basis of Presentation 
       
  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) contain all adjustments (all of which are of a normal recurring nature) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the results of operations for each of the   three   and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and cash flows and changes in stockholders' equity for each of the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The balance sheet information at   December 31, 2015   is derived from audited consolidated financial statements. Certain reclassifications, none of which were material, have been made to conform prior year financial statements to the   September 30, 2016   presentation. These reclassifications did not change previously reported net income or stockholders  equity. 
    
  These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Operating results for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 

(2) 
    Acquisitions 
       
  Flathead Bank.    On   April 6, 2016  , the Company's bank subsidiary, First Interstate Bank ("FIB"), entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Flathead Bank of Bigfork ("Flathead"), a Montana-based bank wholly owned by Flathead Holding Company.  The acquisition was completed as of   August 12, 2016   for cash consideration of $  34,100  . The acquisition allowed the Company to gain market share in several of its current market areas and expand its market presence in Montana.  The Company also benefited from cost savings related to the merger of Flathead with FIB. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method with the cash purchase price funded from cash on hand.  In conjunction with the acquisition, the Company recognized acquisition costs of $  1,197  .  
    
  The assets and liabilities of Flathead were recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  The excess value of the consideration paid over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill arising from the acquisition consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of Flathead and the Company.  
    
  The following table summarizes the consideration paid, fair values of the Flathead assets acquired and liabilities assumed and the resulting goodwill.  All amounts reported are provisional pending completion of management review.

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

Explanation of fair value adjustments: 
      (1) 
    Write up of the book value of investments to their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition based upon quotes obtained from an independent third party pricing service. 
      (2) 
    Write down of the book value of loans to their estimated fair values. The fair value of loans was estimated using cash flow projections based on the remaining maturity and repricing terms, adjusted for estimated future credit losses and prepayments and discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted market rate for similar loans. The fair value of collateral dependent loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality was estimated based on the Company's analysis of the fair value of each loan's underlying collateral, discounted using market-derived rates of return with consideration given to the period of time and costs associated with foreclosure and disposition of the collateral. 
      (3) 
    Adjustment to remove the Flathead allowance for loan losses at acquisition date as the credit risk is accounted for in the fair value adjustment for loans receivable described in (2) above. 
      (4) 
    Write up of the book value of premises and equipment to their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition based upon appraisals obtained from an independent third party appraiser or pending buy/sell agreements.  
      (5) 
    Adjustment represents the value of the core deposit base assumed in the acquisition based upon an internal  valuation using industry averages obtained from an investment banking firm.  
      (6) 
    Adjustment consists of the write-off of pre-existing goodwill and prepaid assets.  
      (7) 
    Decrease in book value of time deposits to their estimated fair values based upon interest rates of similar time deposits with similar terms on the date of acquisition. 

The core deposit intangible asset of $  2,486   is being amortized using an accelerated method over the estimated useful lives of the related deposits of   nine   years. 
    
  The Company acquired certain loans that are subject to Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 310-30 "Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality."  ASC Topic 310-30 provides recognition, measurement and disclosure guidance for acquired loans that have evidence of deterioration in credit quality since origination for which it is probable, at acquisition, the Company will be unable to collect all contractual amounts owed.  For loans that meet the criteria stipulated in ASC Topic 310-30, the excess of all cash flows expected at acquisition over the initial fair value of the loans acquired ("accretable yield") is amortized to interest income over the expected remaining lives of the underlying loans using the effective interest method. The accretable yield will fluctuate due to changes in (i) estimated lives of underling credit-impaired loans, (ii) assumptions regarding future principal and interest amounts collected, and (iii) indices used to fair value variable rate loans.  
  Information regarding acquired credit-impaired loans as of the   August 12, 2016   acquisition date is as follows: 
                     Contractually required principal and interest payments

The accompanying consolidated statements of income include the results of operations of the acquired entity from the   August 12, 2016   acquisition date.  Operations of the acquired entity were immediately integrated with the Company's operations.  Post-acquisition revenues and net income of the acquired entity were not captured separately subsequent to the merger.  As such, the Company has determined it is not practical to report the post-acquisition date revenues and net income of the acquired entity that were included in the Company's consolidated income statement for the three months and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The following table presents unaudited pro forma consolidated revenues and net income as if the acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2015. 

The unaudited pro forma net income presented in the table above for   2016   was adjusted to exclude acquisition-related costs, including change in control expenses related to employee benefit plans and legal and professional expenses of $  778  , net of tax.  Pro forma net income presented in the table above for   2015   was adjusted to include the aforementioned acquisition-related costs.  The unaudited pro forma net income presented in the table above for   2016   and   2015   includes adjustments for scheduled amortization of core deposit intangible assets acquired in the acquisition.  The unaudited pro forma net income presented in the table above for   2016   and   2015   does not include operating costs savings and other business synergies expected as a result of the acquisition and adjustments for accretion or amortization of fair value adjustments other than core deposit intangible assets.  
    
  Absarokee Bancorporation, Inc.    On   July 24, 2015  , the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of Absarokee Bancorporation, Inc. ("Absarokee"), a Montana-based bank holding company that operated   one   subsidiary bank, United Bank.  The Company merged United Bank with and into FIB immediately subsequent to the acquisition.  During   March 2016  , the Company completed its review of Absarokee's tax items and finalized the fair value of the acquired deferred tax asset.  Finalization of provisional estimates resulted in a $  42   decrease in goodwill.

Gross realized gains and losses from the disposition of investment securities are summarized in the following table: 

On   October 30, 2015  , the Company transferred available-for-sale U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with amortized costs and fair values of $  100,343   and $  100,140  , respectively, into the held-to-maturity category.  Unrealized net losses of $  203   included in accumulated other comprehensive income at the time of the transfer are being amortized to yield over the remaining expected lives of the transferred securities of   4.0 years  . 
    
  On   June 27, 2014  , the Company transferred available-for-sale U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations with amortized costs and fair values of $  396,640   and $  388,808  , respectively, into the held-to-maturity category.  Unrealized net losses of $  7,832   at the time of the transfer are being amortized to yield over the remaining expected lives of the transferred securities of   4.3 years  .

The investment portfolio is evaluated quarterly for other-than-temporary declines in the market value of each individual investment security. The Company had   126   and   198   individual investment securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the intent and ability to hold these investment securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery. Furthermore, the Company does not have the intent to sell any of the available-for-sale securities in the above table and it is more likely than not that the Company will not have to sell any securities before a recovery in cost. No impairment losses were recorded during three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
       
  Maturities of investment securities at   September 30, 2016   are shown below. Maturities of mortgage-backed securities have been adjusted to reflect shorter maturities based upon estimated prepayments of principal. All other investment securities maturities are shown at contractual maturity dates. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had investment securities callable within one year with amortized costs and estimated fair values of $  220,907   and $  221,189  , respectively. These investment securities are primarily included in the after one year but within five years category in the table above. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had callable structured notes with amortized costs and estimated fair values of $  10,095   and   $10,100  , respectively.

The following table summarizes changes in the accretable yield for loans acquired credit impaired for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :   

Acquired loans that met the criteria for nonaccrual of interest prior to acquisition were considered performing upon acquisition.  If interest on non-accrual loans had been accrued, such income would have been approximately $  820   and $  828   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $2,492   and   $2,331   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   respectively. 
    
  The Company considers impaired loans to include all originated and acquired loans, except consumer loans, that are risk rated as doubtful, or have been placed on non-accrual status or renegotiated in troubled debt restructurings.  The following tables present information on the Company s recorded investment in impaired loans as of dates indicated:

The amount of interest income recognized by the Company within the period that the loans were impaired was primarily related to loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring that remained on accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual impaired loans are applied to principal. Interest income is subsequently recognized only to the extent cash payments are received in excess of principal due. If interest on impaired loans had been accrued, interest income on impaired loans would have been approximately $  993   and $  998   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $2,994   and   $2,932   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  
       
  Collateralized impaired loans are generally recorded at the fair value of the underlying collateral using discounted cash flows, independent appraisals and management estimates based upon current market conditions. For loans measured under the present value of cash flows method, the change in present value attributable to the passage of time, if applicable, is recognized in the provision for loan losses and thus no interest income is recognized. 
    
  Modifications of performing loans are made in the ordinary course of business and are completed on a case-by-case basis as negotiated with the borrower. Loan modifications typically include interest rate concessions, interest only periods of less than twelve months, short-term payment deferrals and extension of amortization periods to provide payment relief.  A loan modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring if the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and the Company, for economic or legal reasons, grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. Certain troubled debt restructurings are on non-accrual status at the time of restructuring and are typically returned to accrual status after considering the borrower's sustained repayment performance in accordance with the restructuring agreement for a period of at least six months and management is reasonably assured of future performance. If the troubled debt restructuring meets these performance criteria and the interest rate granted at the modification is equal to or greater than the rate that the Company was willing to accept at the time of the restructuring for a new loan with comparable risk, then the loan will return to performing status and the accrual of interest will resume.  
         
  The Company had loans renegotiated in troubled debt restructurings of $  44,704   as of   September 30, 2016  , of which $  27,541   were included in non-accrual loans and $  17,163   were on accrual status. The Company had loans renegotiated in troubled debt restructurings of $  40,330   as of   December 31, 2015  , of which $  24,911   were included in non-accrual loans and $  15,419   were on accrual status.

The following table presents information on the Company's troubled debt restructurings that occurred during the   three   and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  :  

For troubled debt restructurings that were on non-accrual status or otherwise deemed impaired before the modification, a specific reserve may already be recorded. In periods subsequent to modification, the Company continues to evaluate all troubled debt restructurings for possible impairment and recognizes impairment through the allowance.  Additionally these loans continue to work their way through the credit cycle through charge-off, pay-off or foreclosure. Financial effects of modifications of troubled debt restructurings may include principal loan forgiveness or other charge-offs directly related to the restructuring. The Company had   no   charge-offs directly related to modifying troubled debt restructurings during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .    
       
  The following table presents information on the Company's troubled debt restructurings during the previous 12 months for which there was a payment default during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company considers a payment default to occur on troubled debt restructurings when the loan is 90 days or more past due or was placed on non-accrual status after the modification.   

At   September 30, 2016  , there were no material commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose existing loans have been renegotiated or are classified as non-accrual. 
       
  As part of the on-going and continuous monitoring of the credit quality of the Company s loan portfolio, management tracks internally assigned risk classifications of loans.  The Company adheres to a Uniform Classification System developed jointly by the various bank regulatory agencies to internally risk rate loans. The Uniform Classification System defines three broad categories of criticized assets, which the Company uses as credit quality indicators: 
       
  Other Assets Especially Mentioned     includes loans that exhibit weaknesses in financial condition, loan structure or documentation, which if not promptly corrected, may lead to the development of abnormal risk elements.

Substandard     includes loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower. Although the primary source of repayment for a substandard loan is not currently sufficient, collateral or other sources of repayment are sufficient to satisfy the debt. Continuance of a substandard loan is not warranted unless positive steps are taken to improve the worthiness of the credit. 
       
  Doubtful     includes loans that exhibit pronounced weaknesses to a point where collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, is highly questionable and improbable. Doubtful loans are required to be placed on non-accrual status and are assigned specific loss exposure. 
    
  Company management undertakes the same process for assigning risk ratings to acquired loans as it does for originated loans.  Acquired loans rated as substandard or lower or that were on non-accrual status or designated as troubled debt restructurings at the time of acquisition are deemed to be acquired credit impaired loans accounted for under ASC Topic 310-30, regardless of whether they are classified as performing or non-performing loans.

The Company performs a quarterly assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The methodology used to assess the adequacy is consistently applied to the Company's loan portfolio and consists of three elements: (1) specific valuation allowances based on probable losses on impaired loans; (2) historical valuation allowances based on loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends; and (3) general valuation allowances determined based on changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the Company. 
       
  Specific allowances are established for loans where management has determined that probability of a loss exists by analyzing the borrower s ability to repay amounts owed, collateral deficiencies and any relevant qualitative or economic factors impacting the loan. Historical valuation allowances are determined by applying percentage loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans. For commercial, agricultural and real estate loans, loss factors are applied based on the internal risk classifications of these loans. For consumer loans, loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis. For commercial, agriculture and real estate loans, loss factor percentages are based on a migration analysis of our historical loss experience, designed to account for credit deterioration. For consumer loans, loss factor percentages are based on a one-year loss history. General valuation allowances are determined by evaluating, on a quarterly basis, changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, current economic and regulatory conditions and the estimated impact of these factors on historical loss rates.       
    
  An allowance for loan losses is established for loans acquired credit impaired and for which the Company projects a decrease in the expected cash flows in periods subsequent to the acquisition of such loans.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,  the Company's allowance for loan losses included   $433   and   $382  , respectively, related to loans acquired credit impaired.

    Other Real Estate Owned 
          
  Information with respect to the Company's other real estate owned follows: 

Foreclosed residential real estate properties of $  2,730   and   $1,686   were included in other real estate owned as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.  The Company did not have any consumer mortgage loans collateralized by residential real estate property that were in the process of foreclosure as of   September 30, 2016   or December 31, 2015. 

(7) 
    Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
       
  Interest Rate Swap Contracts Designated as Hedges.    For asset and liability management purposes, the Company has entered into an interest rate swap contract to hedge against changes in forecasted cash flows due to interest rate exposures.  The swap agreement is a derivative instrument and converts a portion of the Company s forecasted variable rate debt to a fixed rate (i.e., cash flow hedge) over the payment term of the interest rate swap. The effective portion of the gain or loss on cash flow hedging instruments is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of the gain or loss on derivative instruments, if any, is recognized in earnings.  The Company does not enter into interest rate swap agreements for trading or speculative purposes.  
    
  On   September 22, 2015  , the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of   $100,000   that was designated as a cash flow hedge.  Under the terms of the interest rate swap contract, the Company pays a fixed interest rate of   1.94%   and the counterparty pays to the Company a variable interest rate equal to the three-month LIBOR.  No cash is exchanged until the effective date, which begins on   September 15, 2017   and ends on   September 15, 2020  .  The Company designated the interest payments related to Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings as the cash flow hedge.  The hedge was fully effective during the current period.  As such, no amount of ineffectiveness was included in the Company's income statement for the three or   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company expects the hedge to remain highly effective during the remaining term of the interest rate swap.   
    
  Non-Hedging Interest Rate Swap Contracts.    The Company enters into certain interest rate swap contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivative contracts relate to transactions in which the Company enters into an interest rate swap with a customer while at the same time entering into an offsetting interest rate swap with a third party financial institution. Because the Company acts as an intermediary for the customer, changes in the fair value of the underlying derivative contracts for the most part offset each other and do not significantly impact the Company's results of operations.  
    
  Interest Rate Lock Commitments and Forward Loan Sales Contracts.    In the normal course of business, the Company enters into interest rate lock commitments to finance residential mortgage loans that are not designated as accounting hedges. These commitments, which contain fixed expiration dates, offer the borrower an interest rate guarantee provided the loan meets underwriting guidelines and closes within the timeframe established by the Company. Interest rate risk arises on these commitments and subsequently closed loans if interest rates change between the time of the interest rate lock and the delivery of the loan to the investor. Loan commitments related to residential mortgage loans intended to be sold are considered derivatives and are marked to market through earnings. In addition to the effects of the change

  (Dollars in thousands, except share and per share data) 

in market interest rate, the fair value measurement of the derivative also contemplates the expected cash flows to be received from the counterparty from the future sale of the loan. 
    
  The Company sells residential mortgage loans on either a best efforts or mandatory delivery basis. The Company mitigates the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing interest rate lock commitments by entering into forward loan sales contracts. During the interest rate lock commitment period, these forward loan sales contracts are marked to market through earnings and are not designated as accounting hedges. Exclusive of the fair value component associated with the projected cash flows from the loan delivery to the investor, the changes in fair value related to movements in market rates of the interest rate lock commitments and the forward loan sales contracts generally move in opposite directions, and the net impact of changes in these valuations on net income during the loan commitment period is generally inconsequential. When the loan is funded to the borrower, the interest rate lock commitment derivative expires and the Company records a loan held for sale. The forward loan sales contract acts as a hedge against the variability in cash to be received from the loan sale.  
    
  The changes in measurement of the estimated fair values of the interest rate lock commitments and forward loan sales contracts are included in mortgage banking revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. 
    
  The notional amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's derivatives are presented in the following table. Fair value estimates are obtained from third parties and are based on pricing models.

On July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank issued a final rule implementing a revised regulatory capital framework for U.S. banks in accordance with the Basel III international accord, ("Basel III").  Basel III includes a more stringent definition of capital and introduces a new common equity tier 1, or CET1, capital requirement, sets forth a comprehensive methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets, introduces a conservation buffer and sets out minimum capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards.  Under Basel III, certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital began to phase in starting January 1, 2015 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer required under Basel III began to phase in starting January 1, 2016 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2019.

    Commitments and Contingencies 
       
  In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various other claims and litigation. In the opinion of management, following consultation with legal counsel, the ultimate liability or disposition thereof of all other claims and litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity of the Company. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a commitment under a forward starting interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $  100,000  .  For additional information about the forward starting interest rate swap contract, see Note 7   Derivatives and Hedging Activity.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had commitments under construction contracts of   $527  .  
    
  Residential mortgage loans sold to investors in the secondary market are sold with varying recourse provisions. Essentially all of the loan sales agreements require the repurchase of a mortgage loan by the seller in situations such as breach of representation, warranty or covenant; untimely document delivery; false or misleading statements; failure to obtain certain certificates or insurance; unmarketability; etc. Certain loan sales agreements contain repurchase requirements based on payment-related defects that are defined in terms of the number of days or months since the purchase, the sequence number of the payment, and/or the number of days of payment delinquency. Based on the specific terms stated in the agreements, the Company had $  2,912   of sold residential mortgage loans with recourse provisions still in effect as of   September 30, 2016  .  

(12) 
    Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk 
          
  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the commitment contract. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. At   September 30, 2016  , commitments to extend credit to existing and new borrowers approximated $  1,604,619  , which included $  545,399   on unused credit card lines and $  419,638   with commitment maturities beyond one year. 
       
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding standby letters of credit of $  54,424  . The estimated fair value of the obligation undertaken by the Company in issuing the standby letters of credit is included in other liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheet.

    Fair Value Measurements 
                        
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. There is a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows: 
       
     Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
       
     Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
       
     Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of of assets or liabilities 
       
  The methodologies used by the Company in determining the fair values of each class of financial instruments are based primarily on the use of independent, market-based data to reflect a value that would be reasonably expected in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, and therefore are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. There were no transfers between fair value hierarchy levels during the three or nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
       
  Further details on the methods used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments above are discussed below:   
    
  Investment Securities Available-for-Sale  .  The Company obtains fair value measurements for investment securities from an independent pricing service. The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the investment's terms and conditions, among other things.  Vendors chosen by the Company are widely recognized vendors whose evaluations support the pricing functions of financial institutions, investment and mutual funds, and portfolio managers. If needed, a broker may be utilized to determine the reported fair value of investment securities.  
       
  Loans Held for Sale.    Fair value measurements for loans held for sale are obtained from an independent pricing service.  The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include binding contracts or quotes or bids from third party investors as well as loan level pricing adjustments. 
       
  Interest Rate Swap Contracts.    Fair values for derivative interest rate swap contracts are based upon the estimated amounts to settle the contracts considering current interest rates and are calculated using discounted cash flows that are observable or that can be corroborated by observable market data.  The inputs used to determine fair value include the 3 month LIBOR forward curve to estimate variable rate cash inflows and the federal funds effective swap rate to estimate the discount rate. The estimated variable rate cash inflows are compared to the fixed rate outflows and such difference is discounted to a present value to estimate the fair value of the interest rate swaps.  The change in the value of derivative assets attributable to basis risk, or the risk that offsetting investments in a hedging strategy will not experience price changes in entirely opposite directions from each other, was not significant in the reported periods.  The Company also obtains and compares the reasonableness of the pricing from an independent third party.  
    
  Interest Rate Lock Commitments.    Fair value measurements for interest rate lock commitments are obtained from an independent pricing service.  The fair value measurements consider observable data that may include prices available from secondary market investors taking into consideration various characteristics of the loan, including the loan amount, interest rate, value of the servicing and loan to value ratio, among other things. Observable data is then adjusted to reflect changes in interest rates, the Company's estimated pull-through rate and estimated direct costs necessary to complete the commitment into a closed loan net of origination and processing fees collected from the borrower.  
    
  Forward Loan Sales Contracts.    The fair value measurements for forward loan sales contracts are obtained from an independent pricing service.  The fair value measurements consider observable data that includes sales of similar loans.

Deferred Compensation Plan Assets and Liabilities.    The fair values of deferred compensation plan assets are based primarily on the use of independent, market-based data to reflect a value that would be reasonably expected in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  These investments are in the same funds and purchased in the same amounts as the participants  selected investments, which represent the underlying liabilities to plan participants. Deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of participants  selected investments.  
    
  Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are as follows:

Additionally, from time to time, certain assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.  Adjustments to fair value generally result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets due to impairment.  The following table presents information about the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis: 

Impaired Loans.   Collateralized impaired loans are reported at the fair value of the underlying collateral if repayment is expected solely from collateral. The impaired loans are reported at fair value through specific valuation allowance allocations. In addition, when it is determined that the fair value of an impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, the carrying value of the loan is adjusted to fair value through a charge to the allowance for loan losses.  Collateral values are estimated using independent appraisals and management estimates of current market conditions.  As of   September 30, 2016  , certain impaired loans with a carrying value of $  68,733   were reduced by specific valuation allowance allocations of $  18,565   and partial loan charge-offs of $  10,422   resulting in a reported fair value of $  39,746  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , certain impaired loans with a carrying value of $  42,679   were reduced by specific valuation allowance allocations of $  11,575   and partial loan charge-offs of $  10,229   resulting in a reported fair value of $  20,875  .  
           
  OREO.  The fair values of OREO are estimated using independent appraisals and management estimates of current market conditions.  Upon initial recognition, write-downs based on the foreclosed asset's fair value at foreclosure are reported through charges to the allowance for loan losses.  Periodically, the fair value of foreclosed assets is remeasured with any subsequent write-downs charged to OREO expense in the period in which they are identified.  Write-downs of   $603   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included   $550   directly related to receipt of updated appraisals and $  53   based on management estimates of the current fair value of properties.  Write downs of   $179   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   included   $106   directly related to receipt of updated appraisals and $  73   based on management estimates of the current fair value of properties. 
       
  Long-lived Assets to be Disposed of by Sale.   Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell. The fair values of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are based upon observable market data and management estimates of current market conditions.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale with carrying values aggregating   $2,363   that were reduced by write-downs of   $857   resulting in an aggregate fair value of   $1,506  .

The following table presents additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and for which the Company has utilized Level 3 inputs to determine fair values: 

The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practical to estimate fair value. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis are discussed above. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of other financial instruments are discussed below. For financial instruments bearing a variable interest rate where no credit risk exists, it is presumed that recorded book values are reasonable estimates of fair value. 
               
  Financial Assets.   Carrying values of cash, cash equivalents and accrued interest receivable approximate fair values due to the liquid and/or short-term nature of these instruments. Fair values for investment securities held-to-maturity are obtained from an independent pricing service, which considers observable data that may include dealer quotes, market spreads, cash flows, the U.S. Treasury yield curve, live trading levels, trade execution data, market consensus prepayment speeds, credit information and the investment s terms and conditions, among other things. Fair values of fixed rate loans and variable rate loans that reprice on an infrequent basis are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current interest rates at which similar loans with similar terms would be made to borrowers of similar credit quality.  Carrying values of variable rate loans that reprice frequently, and with no change in credit risk, approximate the fair values of these instruments. 
           
  Financial Liabilities.   The fair values of demand deposits, savings accounts, securities sold under repurchase agreements and accrued interest payable are the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair values of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit are estimated using external market rates currently offered for deposits with similar remaining maturities. The fair values of derivative liabilities are obtained from an independent pricing service, which considers observable data that may include the three-month LIBOR forward curve,  the federal funds effective swap rate and cash flows, among other things.  The carrying values of the interest bearing demand notes to the United States Treasury are deemed an approximation of fair values due to the frequent repayment and repricing at market rates.  The fixed and floating rate subordinated debentures, floating rate subordinated term loan, notes payable to the FHLB, fixed rate subordinated term debt, and capital lease obligation are estimated by discounting future cash flows using current rates for advances with similar characteristics.   
    
  Commitments to Extend Credit and Standby Letters of Credit.   The fair value of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, is not significant.

    Recent Authoritative Accounting Guidance               
           
  ASU 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers."    The amendments in Accounting Standards Update  ("ASU") 2014-09 introduce a new five-step revenue recognition model in which an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  ASU 2014-09 also requires disclosures sufficient to enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers, including qualitative and quantitative disclosures about contracts with customers, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract.

ASU 2014-12 "Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period."    ASU 2014-12 amends Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to clarify that a performance target that affects the vesting of a share-based payment award and that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be treated as a performance condition that affects the vesting of the award.  ASU 2014-12 further clarifies that the requisite service period ends when the employees can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved.  The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2014-12 effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.       
       
  ASU 2014-16 "Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or to Equity."    The amendments in ASU 2014-16 clarify that an entity should consider all relevant terms and features-including the embedded derivative feature being evaluated for bifurcation-in evaluating the nature of the host contract within a hybrid financial instrument.  The amendments further clarify that no single term or feature would necessarily determine the economic characteristics and risk of the host contract.  Rather, the nature of the host contract depends upon the economic characteristics and risk of the entire hybrid financial instrument.  The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2014-16 effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity. 
       
  ASU 2015-02 "Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis."    The amendments in ASU 2015-02 (i) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with variable interest entities, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships, and (iv) provide scope exceptions from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interest in legal entities that are required to comply or operate in accordance with requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered market funds.  The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2015-02 effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity. 
       
  ASU 2015-03 "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs."    The amendments in ASU 2015-03 require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, rather than as a deferred charge.  The guidance in ASU 2015-03 did not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issues costs related to line-of-credit arrangements.  ASU 2015-15,  Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements, Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting," addresses this gap. ASU 2015-15 adds that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity. 
       
  ASU 2015-05 "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software."    The amendments in ASU 2015-05 provide guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license.  Under the guidance in ASU 2015-05, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses.  If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract.  The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2015-05 effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity. 
       
  ASU 2015-10 "Technical Corrections and Improvements."    The amendments in ASU 2015-10 represent changes to clarify the codification, correct unintended application of guidance, or make minor improvements to the codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities.  The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2015-10 effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.

ASU 2015-16 "Business Combinations-Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments."    The amendments in ASU 2015-16 eliminate the requirement to retrospectively account for adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized as part of a business combination. Under the amendments in ASU 2015-16, an acquirer must recognize adjustments to the provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The amendments in ASU 2015-16 require that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The Company adopted the amendments in ASU 2015-16 effective January 1, 2016.  The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  ASU 2016-01 "Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities."    The amendments in ASU 2016-1, among other things, (i) require equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income, (ii) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment, (iii) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, (iv) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, (v) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments, (vi) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements and (viii) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale investment securities.  The amendments in ASU 2016-1 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2018, and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  ASU 2016-02 "Leases (Topic 842)."    On February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new lease accounting guidance in  ASU No. 2016-02.  Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right of use asset for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date of the lease and disclose key information about leasing arrangements.  Accounting by lessors is largely unchanged.  ASU 2016-02 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2019 and will be applied using a modified retrospective approach.  The Company is evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.  
    
  ASU 2016-05 "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships."    The amendments in ASU 2016-05 clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under ASC Topic 815 does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. The amendments in ASU 2016-05 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, and are not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity. 
    
  ASU 2016-07 "Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting."    The amendments in ASU 2016-07 eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualified for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investments, results of operations and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods hat the investment had been held.  The amendments in ASU 2016-07 also simplify the transition to the equity method of accounting by eliminating retroactive adjustment of the investment when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method, among other things.  The amendments in ASU 2016-07 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, and are not expected to have a significant impact on on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.

ASU 2016-08 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)."   The amendments in ASU 2016-08 were issued to clarify certain principal versus agent considerations within the implementation guidance of ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The effective date and transition of ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), as discussed above. The Company is continuing to evaluate the new guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.  
    
  ASU 2016-09 "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."    Under the amendments in ASU 2016-09, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to share-based payment awards should be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement during the period in which they occur. Previously, such amounts were recorded in the pool of excess tax benefits included in additional paid-in capital, if such pool was available. Because excess tax benefits are no longer recognized in additional paid-in capital, the assumed proceeds from applying the treasury stock method when computing earnings per share should exclude the amount of excess tax benefits that would have previously been recognized in additional paid-in capital. Additionally, excess tax benefits should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity rather than a financing activity, as was previously the case. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 also provide that an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (current GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 change the threshold to qualify for equity classification to permit withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates (rather than the minimum as was previously the case) in the applicable jurisdictions. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 will be effective for the Company on January 1, 2017, and are not expected to have a significant impact on impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.  
    
  ASU No. 2016-10 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing."   The amendments in ASU 2016-10 were issued to clarify ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  related to (i) identifying performance obligations; and (ii) the licensing implementation guidance. The effective date and transition of ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date and transition of ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  as discussed above. The Company is continuing to evaluate the new guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements, results of operations and liquidity.  
    
  ASU No. 2016-13 "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326):  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments."    The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require a financial asset or group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented on a company's financial statements at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 requires a company's income statement to reflect the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 require that the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination be measured at amortized cost basis with the initial allowance for credit losses added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit loss expense.  ASU 2016-13 also requires that credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities be recorded through an allowance for credit losses.  The amendments in ASU 2016-13 are effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The amendments will be applied through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period.  A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which other-than-temporary impairment was recognized before the effective date.  Amounts previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income as of the date of adoption that relate to improvement in cash flows expected to be collected will continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the asset.  Recoveries of amounts previously written off relating to improvements in cash flows after the date of adoption will be recorded in earnings when received.  The Company is currently evaluating the new guidance to determine the impact it will have on its consolidated financial statements, results of operations and liquidity.

ASU No. 2016-15 "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."      The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are intended to reduce diversity in practice in how eight particular transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. Entities will be required to apply the guidance retrospectively. If it is impracticable to apply the guidance retrospectively for an issue, the amendments related to that issue would be applied prospectively. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 only affect the classification of certain items within the statement of cash flows, and are not expected to have a significant impact on impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity.  

Subsequent events have been evaluated for potential recognition and disclosure through the date financial statements were filed with the SEC.  On   October 21, 2016  , the Company declared a quarterly dividend to common shareholders of $  0.22   per share, to be paid on   November 14, 2016   to shareholders of record as of   October 31, 2016  .

  Executive Overview 
       
  We are a financial holding company headquartered in Billings, Montana. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had consolidated assets of    $8,974 million  , deposits of   $7,329 million  , loans of   $5,531 million   and total stockholders  equity of   $983 million  . We currently operate 80 banking offices, including detached drive-up facilities, in 46 communities located in Montana, Wyoming and South Dakota. Through our bank subsidiary, First Interstate Bank, or FIB, we deliver a comprehensive range of banking products and services to individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities throughout our market areas. Our customers participate in a wide variety of industries, including energy, tourism, agriculture, healthcare, professional services, education, governmental services, construction, mining, retail and wholesale trade.

Table of Contents  

Our Business 
                       
  Our principal business activity is lending to and accepting deposits from individuals, businesses, municipalities and other entities. We derive our income principally from interest charged on loans and, to a lesser extent, from interest and dividends earned on investments. We also derive income from non-interest sources such as fees received in connection with various lending and deposit services; trust, employee benefit, investment and insurance services; mortgage loan originations, sales and servicing; merchant and electronic banking services; and from time to time, gains on sales of assets. Our principal expenses include interest expense on deposits and borrowings, operating expenses, provisions for loan losses and income tax expense. 
       
  Our loan portfolio consists of a mix of real estate, consumer, commercial, agricultural and other loans, including fixed and variable rate loans. Our real estate loans comprise commercial real estate, construction (including residential, commercial and land development loans), residential, agricultural and other real estate loans. Fluctuations in the loan portfolio are directly related to the economies of the communities we serve. While each loan originated must meet minimum underwriting standards established in our credit policies, lending officers are granted discretion within pre-approved limits in approving and pricing loans to assure that the banking offices are responsive to competitive issues and community needs in each market area.  We fund our loan portfolio primarily with the core deposits from our customers, generally without utilizing brokered deposits and with minimal reliance on wholesale funding sources.   
       
  Recent Developments 
       
  On April 6, 2016, our bank subsidiary, First Interstate Bank, entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire all of the outstanding stock of Flathead Bank of Bigfork, or Flathead Bank, a wholly-owned subsidiary of  Flathead Holding Company of Bigfork, with branches located in western and northwestern Montana. The acquisition was completed on August 12, 2016 for cash consideration of $34 million. As of the date of the acquisition, Flathead Bank had total assets of $254 million, loans of $83 million and deposits of $210 million.  For additional information regarding the acquisition, see  Note 2   Acquisitions  in the accompanying  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  included in this report. 
       
  On July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank issued a final rule implementing a revised regulatory capital framework for U.S. banks in accordance with the Basel III international accord, or Basel III. Under Basel II, certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital began phasing in starting January 1, 2015 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer phases in beginning January 1, 2016 and will be fully implemented on                 January 1, 2019.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had capital levels that, in all cases, exceeded the well-capitalized guidelines. For additional information regarding our capital levels, see "Capital Resources and Liquidity Management" included herein and  Note 10   Regulatory Capital  in the accompanying  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  included in this report. 
       
  Effective January 1, 2016, we elected to account for our loans held for sale using the fair value option.  Under the fair value option, unrealized gains and losses on loans held for sale are included in mortgage banking revenues in our consolidated statements of income.  Changes in the fair value of mortgage loans decreased mortgage banking revenues by $752 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and increased mortgage banking revenues by $1.9 million during the nine months ended  September 30, 2016.  
    
  Also effective January 1, 2016, we began reducing mortgage banking revenues by the direct standard costs of originating residential mortgage loans held for sale, resulting in a decrease in mortgage banking revenues and a corresponding decrease in salaries and wages expense during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, direct standard costs of originating mortgage loans held for sale were $3.3 million and $8.1 million, respectively.  
       
  In prior periods, we recorded net gains or losses attributable to deferred compensation plan assets as other income, and the corresponding compensation expense or benefit related to these net gains or losses as employee benefits expense in our consolidated statements of income.  However, because we pass all gains or losses on deferred compensation plan assets through to plan participants, these income and expense amounts offset and do not impact our consolidated net income.  To eliminate fluctuations in other income and employee benefits expense caused by changes in the market values of deferred compensation plan assets, during second quarter 2016 we began recording these gains or losses in other income net of the directly offsetting employee compensation expense or benefit.  All prior periods presented in this report have been revised to reflect this change.

Primary Factors Used in Evaluating Our Business 
                   
  As a banking institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our financial condition and our results of operations. We monitor our financial condition and performance and evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our balance sheet and statements of income, as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against both our own historical levels and the financial condition and performance of comparable banking institutions in our region and nationally. 
       
  Results of Operations 
           
  Principal factors used in managing and evaluating our results of operations include return on average equity, net interest income, non-interest income, non-interest expense and net income. Net interest income is affected by the level of interest rates, changes in interest rates and changes in the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, which we refer to as interest rate spread. The volume of loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets, compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness, combined with the interest rate spread, produces changes in our net interest income between periods. Non-interest bearing sources of funds, such as demand deposits and stockholders  equity, also support earning assets. 
    
   The impact of free funding sources is captured in the net interest margin, which is calculated as net interest income divided by average earning assets. We evaluate our net interest income on factors that include the yields on our loans and other earning assets, the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, and the levels of our net interest spread and net interest margin. 
           
  We seek to increase our non-interest income over time and we evaluate our non-interest income relative to the trends of the individual types of non-interest income taking into consideration seasonality and prevailing market conditions. 
       
  We manage our non-interest expenses in consideration of growth opportunities and our community banking model that emphasizes customer service and responsiveness. We evaluate our non-interest expense on factors that include our non-interest expense relative to our average assets, our efficiency ratio and the trends of the individual categories of non-interest expense. 
       
  We seek to increase our net income and provide favorable shareholder returns over time, and we evaluate our net income relative to the performance of other bank holding companies on factors that include return on average assets, return on average equity, total shareholder return and growth in earnings. 
       
  Financial Condition 
       
  Principal areas of focus in managing and evaluating our financial condition include liquidity, the diversification and quality of our loans, the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, the diversification and terms of our deposits and other funding sources, the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets and liabilities, including potential interest rate exposure and the adequacy of our capital levels. We seek to maintain sufficient levels of cash and investment securities to meet potential payment and funding obligations, and we evaluate our liquidity on factors that include the levels of cash and highly liquid assets relative to our liabilities, the quality and maturities of our investment securities, the ratio of loans to deposits and any reliance on brokered certificates of deposit or other wholesale funding sources. 
       
  We seek to maintain a diverse and high quality loan portfolio and evaluate our asset quality on factors that include the allocation of our loans among loan types, credit exposure to any single borrower or industry type, non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned, or OREO, and loan charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. We seek to maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and we evaluate the level of our allowance for loan losses relative to our overall loan portfolio and the level of non-performing loans and potential charge-offs. 
           
  We seek to fund our assets primarily using core customer deposits spread among various deposit categories, and we evaluate our deposit and funding mix on factors that include the allocation of our deposits among deposit types, the level of our non-interest bearing deposits, the ratio of our core deposits (total deposits excluding time deposits above $100,000) to our total deposits and our reliance on brokered deposits or other wholesale funding sources, such as borrowings from other banks or agencies. We seek to manage the mix, maturities and re-pricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities to maintain relative stability of our net interest rate margin in a changing interest rate environment, and we evaluate our asset-liability management using models to evaluate the changes to our net interest income under different interest rate scenarios.

Finally, we seek to maintain adequate capital levels to absorb unforeseen operating losses and to help support the growth of our balance sheet. We evaluate our capital adequacy using the regulatory and financial capital ratios including leverage capital ratio, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio and tier 1 common capital to total risk-weighted assets ratio. 
       
  Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies 
           
  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and follow general practices within the industries in which we operate. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  The most significant accounting policies we follow are summarized in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
       
  Our critical accounting estimates are summarized below. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires management to make particularly difficult, subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period, or the use of different estimates that management could have reasonably used in the current period, would have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, results of operations or liquidity. 
       
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
           
  The provision for loan losses creates an allowance for loan losses known and inherent in the loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. 
               
  We perform a quarterly assessment of the risks inherent in our loan portfolio, as well as a detailed review of each significant loan with identified weaknesses. Based on this analysis, we record a provision for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. Determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of subjective measurements, including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends and the impact of current local, regional and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio. Subjective measurements may be periodically re-evaluated and changes in these estimates and assumptions are possible and may have a material impact on our allowance, and therefore our consolidated financial statements or results of operations. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at an amount we believe is sufficient to provide for estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date, and fluctuations in the provision for loan losses result from management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Management monitors qualitative and quantitative trends in the loan portfolio, including changes in the levels of past due, internally classified and non-performing loans. Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for loan losses. A discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses is included herein under the heading  Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan Losses." 
               
  Goodwill 
               
  The excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets from acquisitions, or goodwill, is evaluated for impairment at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is likely impairment has occurred.  In any given year, the Company may elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is in excess of its carrying value.  If it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is in excess of the carrying value, or if the Company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment, a two-step quantitative impairment test is performed. In performing a quantitative test for impairment, the fair value of net assets is estimated based on an analysis of our market value, discounted cash flows and peer values. Determining the fair value of goodwill is considered a critical accounting estimate because of its sensitivity to market-based economics. In addition, any allocation of the fair value of goodwill to assets and liabilities requires significant management judgment and the use of subjective measurements.  Variability in market conditions and key assumptions or subjective measurements used to estimate and allocate fair value are reasonably possible and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or results of operations.   Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 describes our accounting policy with regard to goodwill.

Table of Contents  

Our annual goodwill impairment test is performed each year as of July 1   st   .   Upon completion of the most recent  evaluation, it was determined that the estimated fair value of net assets was greater than the carrying value of the Company.  We will continue to monitor our performance and evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently as needed.  
       
  Fair Values of Loans Acquired in Business Combinations 
       
  Loans acquired in business combinations are initially recorded at fair value with no carryover of the related allowance for credit losses. Determining the fair value of the loans involves estimating the amount and timing of principal and interest cash flows initially expected to be collected on the loans and discounting those cash flows at an appropriate market rate of interest. Going forward, the Company continues to evaluate reasonableness of expectations for the timing and the amount of cash to be collected. Subsequent decreases in expected cash flows may result in changes in the amortization or accretion of fair market value adjustments, and in some cases may result in the loan being considered impaired.  For collateral dependent loans with deteriorated credit quality, the Company estimates the fair value of the underlying collateral of the loans. These values are discounted using market derived rates of return, with consideration given to the period of time and costs associated with the foreclosure and disposition of the collateral.   Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 describes our accounting policy with regard to acquired loans.   
       
  Results of Operations 
           
  The following discussion and analysis is intended to provide greater details of the results of our operations and financial condition. 
    
  Net Interest Income.    The most significant impact on our net interest income between periods is derived from the interaction of changes in the volume of and rates earned or paid on interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The volume of loans, investment securities and other interest earning assets, compared to the volume of interest bearing deposits and indebtedness, combined with the interest rate spread, produces changes in the net interest income between periods.

Table of Contents  

The following tables present, for the periods indicated, condensed average balance sheet information, together with interest income and yields earned on average interest earning assets and interest expense and rates paid on average interest bearing liabilities. 

(1) 
    Average loan balances include non-accrual loans. Interest income on loans includes amortization of deferred loan fees net of deferred loan costs, which is not material. 
              (2) 
    Interest income and average rates for tax exempt loans and securities are presented on an FTE basis. 
              (3) 
    Net FTE interest margin during the period equals (i) the difference between annualized interest income on interest earning assets and the annualized interest expense on interest bearing liabilities, divided by (ii) average interest earning assets for the period. 
              (4) 
    Calculated by dividing total annualized interest on interest bearing liabilities by the sum of total interest bearing liabilities plus non-interest bearing deposits.

    Calculated by dividing total annualized interest on interest bearing liabilities by the sum of total interest bearing liabilities plus non-interest bearing deposits.            
       
  Our net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent, or FTE, basis increased $4.3 million, or 6.4%, to $71.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $67.4 million for the same period in 2015, and $10.3 million, or 5.2%, to $209.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $199.2 million for the same period in 2015. These increases were primarily attributable to organic loan growth combined with a shift in the mix of interest earning assets from lower yielding investment securities into higher yielding loans.  Also contributing to the third quarter 2016 increase in net FTE interest income, as compared to third quarter 2015, were increases in net recoveries of previously charged-off interest.  Charged-off interest recoveries were $1.8 million and $2.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $679 thousand and $2.0 million during the same respective periods in 2015. 
       
  Our net FTE interest income was positively impacted by interest accretion related to the fair valuation of acquired loans.  Interest accretion related to the fair valuation of acquired loans was $1.4 million and $4.7 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  This compares to $1.4 million and $4.1 million during the same respective periods in 2015.

Our net interest margin ratio increased 11 basis points to 3.58% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 3.47% for the same period in 2015, and 11 basis points to 3.56% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 3.45% during the same period in 2015.  Increases in net FTE interest margin ratio during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, were primarily due to increases in average outstanding loans, higher yields earned on interest-bearing deposits in banks and investment securities and a slight reduction in funding costs. Exclusive of interest accretion related to the fair valuation of acquired loans and recoveries of previously charged-off interest, our net interest margin ratio was 3.42% during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 3.36% for the same period in 2015, and 3.44% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 3.35% during the same period in 2015.  
           
  The table below sets forth, for the periods indicated, a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense resulting from estimated changes in average asset and liability balances (volume) and estimated changes in average interest rates (rate). Changes which are not due solely to volume or rate have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percent changes in average volume and average rate as they compare to each other.     

(1)  Interest income for tax exempt loans and securities are presented on an FTE basis. 
           
  Provision for Loan Losses.   Fluctuations in the provision for loan losses reflect management's estimate of possible loan losses based upon evaluation of the borrowers' ability to repay, collateral value underlying loans, loan loss trends and estimated effects of current economic conditions on our loan portfolio.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $2.4 million, as compared to $1.1 million during the same period in 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a provision for loan losses of $8.9 million, as compared to $3.5 million during the same period in 2015.  Quarter-to-date and year-to-date increases in provision for loan losses are reflective of loan growth, increases in general and specific reserves related to energy sector loans and higher levels of criticized and non-performing loans.   
    
  During second quarter 2016, we adjusted certain qualitative factors used in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses to better reflect our loss experience subsequent to the financial crisis.  The adjustment resulted in increases in specific reserves on commercial real estate loans, which were partially offset by reductions in general reserves allocated to commercial real estate and construction loans.  For information regarding our non-performing loans, see  Non-Performing Assets  included herein.  For information regarding our allowance for losses and the second quarter 2016 adjustment of certain qualitative factors, see "Financial Condition - Allowance for Loan Losses" included herein.

Non-interest Income.    Our principal sources of non-interest income primarily include fee-based revenues such as payment services, mortgage banking and wealth management revenues, service charges on deposit accounts and other service charges, commissions and fees. Non-interest income increased $693 thousand, or 2.2%, to $31.9 million for the three months ended                     September 30, 2016, as compared to $31.2 million for the same period in 2015, and $2.9 million, or 3.1%, to $93.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $90.9 million during the same period in 2015.  Year-over-year increases in other income were primarily due to the second quarter 2016 non-recurring recovery of $3.8 million of prior year litigation settlement expense.  Other significant components of the quarter-over quarter and year-over year increases are discussed below. 
                   
  Payment services revenues consist of interchange fees paid by merchants for processing electronic payment transactions and ATM service fees.  Payment services revenues increased $445 thousand, or 5.2%, to $9.0 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $8.6 million for the same period in 2015, and $1.3 million, or 5.2%, to $25.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $24.4 million during the same period in 2015, due to additional interchange income resulting from higher credit card transaction volumes. 
       
  Service charges on deposit accounts increased $313 thousand, or 7.1%, to $4.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $4.4 million during the same period  in 2015, and $1.4 million, or 11.4%, to $13.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $12.4 million during the same period in 2015.  The increases were primarily due to increases in overdraft charges on consumer accounts.  Management attributes this increase to a focused effort on educating depositors on the benefits of overdraft protection for one-time debit and ATM card transactions.  As of September 30, 2016, approximately 8% of our depositors have opted for overdraft protection. 
    
  Mortgage banking revenue increased $30 thousand, or less than 1.0%, to $8.0 million during the three months ended  September  30, 2016, as compared to $8.0 million during the same period in 2015, and decreased $2.3 million, or 10.3%, to $20.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $22.7 million during the same period in 2015.  
  Effective January 1, 2016, we began offsetting the direct standard costs of originating residential mortgage loans held for sale against the related mortgage banking revenues.  This offset decreased mortgage banking revenues by $3.3 million and $8.1 million in during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  Also effective January 1, 2016, we elected to carry our loans held for sale at fair value. Changes in the fair value of mortgage loans decreased mortgage banking revenues by $752 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and increased mortgage banking revenues by $1.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
    
  Exclusive of the impacts of the direct standard costs offset and changes in fair values of mortgage loans held for sale described above, mortgage banking revenues increased $2.6 million, or 32.2% to $10.6 million during the three months ended               September 30, 2016, as compared to $8.0 million during the same period in 2015, and $7.7 million, or 33.8%, to $30.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $22.7 million during the same period in 2015.  Despite general declines in mortgage rates, our margin on loan sales increased by approximately 40 basis points beginning in the  second quarter of 2016, which contributed to our quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year growth in revenue. Partially offsetting year-over-year increases in mortgage banking revenues was a $410 thousand gain on the sale of $10.6 million of seasoned portfolio loans that was recorded during second quarter 2015.  During the first nine months of 2016, loans originated for home purchases accounted for approximately 61% of our production, as compared to approximately 66% during the same period in 2015.  
    
  Other income includes company-owned life insurance revenues, check printing income, agency stock dividends and gains on sales of miscellaneous assets. Other income decreased $166 thousand, or 6.7%, to $2.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2.5 million during the same period in 2015, and $1.5 million, or 17.2%, to $7.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $8.5 million during the same period in 2015. During second quarter 2015 we recorded an $863 thousand gain on the sale of land and a $1.0 million expense reversal related to the settlement of claims assumed in a prior period acquisition.  
    
  Non-interest Expense.   Non-interest expense decreased $4.1 million, or 6.2%, to $62.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $66.2 million for the same period in 2015, and $4.4 million, or 2.4%, to $183.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $187.9 million in the same period in 2015, primarily due to reductions in loss contingency expenses.  During third quarter 2015, we recorded loss contingency expenses of $5.0 million related to a lender liability lawsuit.  Other significant components of the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year decreases are discussed below.

Salaries and wages expense decreased $1.8 million, or 7.2%, to $23.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $25.5 million during the same period in 2015, and $5.1 million, or 6.6%, to $71.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $76.9 million during the same period in 2015, primarily due to the offset of direct standard loan costs, principally salaries, wages and commissions, on mortgage loans held for sale against the related mortgage banking revenues.  This offset decreased salaries and wages expense by $3.3 million and $8.1 million during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  
    
  Exclusive of the impacts of the direct standard costs offset described above, salaries and wages expense increased $1.4 million, or 5.7% to $26.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $25.5 million during the same period in 2015, and $3.0 million, or 3.9%, to $79.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $76.9 million during the same period in 2015.  Quarter-over-quarter increases were primarily due to increases in incentive compensation accruals reflective of the Company's performance against predetermined goals. Year-over-year increases were primarily due to one-time separation and special bonus expenses recorded during the first quarter of 2016. 
       
  Employee benefits expense increased $602 thousand, or 7.5%, to $8.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $8.0 million during the same period in 2015, and $2.3 million, or 9.6%, to $26.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $24.0 million during the same period in 2015, primarily due to increases in payroll tax and group health insurance expenses.    
    
  Furniture and equipment expense decreased $1.5 million or 37.7%, to $2.4 million for the three months ended                                  September 30, 2016, as compared to $3.8 million during the same period in 2015, and $4.2 million, or 37.3%, to $7.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $11.3 million during the same period in 2015.  Effective January 1, 2016, we began capturing certain software costs separately from equipment costs, resulting in decreases in furniture and equipment expense and corresponding increases in outsourced technology expenses of approximately $1.4 million and $3.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to the same respective periods in 2015.  
       
  Outsourced technology services expense increased $2.7 million or 106.8%, to $5.2 million for the three months ended                     September 30, 2016, as compared to $2.5 million during the same period in 2015, and $7.3 million, or 95.9%, to $14.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $7.6 million during the same period in 2015.  Approximately $1.4 million of the third quarter 2016 increase and $3.8 million of the year-to-date increase was the result of the classification of certain software costs as outsourced technology services expenses in the current year versus classification as furniture and equipment expense in the prior year.  The remaining quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year increases in outsourced technology services are primarily due to the enhancement of our technology systems and processes to improve scalability and support our future growth.  
    
  Net OREO expense increased $728 thousand, or 101.1%, to $8 thousand during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net OREO income of $720 thousand during the same period in 2015, and $1.7 million, or 106.8%, to $109 thousand during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net OREO income of $1.6 million during the same period in 2015.  Increases in OREO expense were primarily due to lower net gains recognized on the sale of OREO properties.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded net gains on the sale of OREO properties of $57 thousand and $693 thousand, respectively, as compared to net gains on the sale of OREO properties of $1.1 million and $2.9 million recorded during the same respective periods in 2015.  
    
  Professional fees decreased $725 thousand, or 37.8%, to $1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $1.9 million during the same period in 2015, and $1.1 million, or 23.2%, to $3.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $4.7 million during the same period in 2015.  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded higher professional fees in association with the identification and execution of revenue enhancement strategies and changing trust data platforms. 
    
  Other expense decreased $71 thousand, or less than 1.0%, to $12.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $12.6 million during the same period in 2015. During third quarter 2016, we recorded donation expense of $310 thousand related to the charitable contribution of land and a building and incurred other losses of $384 thousand primarily related to the write-off of an equity method investment. These increases were offset by decreases in debit card and travel expenses, and lower fraud losses.

Other expense decreased $1.3 million, or 3.3%, to $36.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $38.0 million for the same period in 2015, primarily due to decreases in advertising expense and lower customer fraud losses.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded customer fraud losses of $784 thousand, compared to $1.5 million during the same period in 2015. In addition, during second quarter 2015, we recorded a one-time contract termination fee of $876 thousand related to a change in payment service provider.   
    
  Acquisition expenses of $1.2 million recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, included legal and professional fees related to the Flathead Bank acquisition in August 2016.  Non-core acquisition expenses of $566 thousand and $629 thousand recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, included legal and professional fees related to the acquisition of Absarokee Bancorporation, Inc. in July 2015.  For additional information regarding acquisitions, see "Recent Developments" included herein and  Note 2   Acquisitions  in the accompanying  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  included in this report. 
    
  Income Tax Expense.    Our effective federal income tax rate was 30.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 29.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  State income tax applies primarily to pretax earnings generated within Montana and South Dakota.  Our effective state tax rate was 4.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 4.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Fluctuations in our effective income tax rates were primarily due to the timing of tax credits.     
    
  Financial Condition 
           
  Total assets increased $246 million, or 2.8%, to $9.0 billion as of September 30, 2016, from $8.7 billion as of       December 31, 2015.  Approximately $228 million of the increase was attributable to the Flathead Bank acquisition.  The remaining increase was primarily due to the deployment of funds generated primarily through organic deposit growth into interest earning assets.  Significant fluctuations in balance sheet accounts are discussed below. 
           
  Loans.   Total loans increased $285 million, or 5.4%, to $5,531 million as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $5,246 million December 31, 2015.  Approximately $83 million of this increase was attributable to the acquisition of Flathead Bank in August 2016.  Exclusive of the Flathead Bank acquisition, total loans grew organically $202 million, or 3.8%, with the most notable growth occurring in commercial, commercial real estate, commercial and residential construction, and indirect consumer loans.  
       
  Commercial loans are typically made to small and medium-sized manufacturing, wholesale, retail and service businesses for working capital needs and business expansions. Commercial loans generally include lines of credit, business credit cards and loans with maturities of five years or less. The loans are generally made with business operations as the primary source of repayment, but also include collateralization by inventory, accounts receivable, equipment and/or personal guarantees. Commercial loans increased $22 million, or 2.8%, to $814 million as of September 30, 2016, from $792 million as of               December 31, 2015, with approximately $9 million of the increase attributable to the Flathead Bank acquisition.  Exclusive of acquired loans, commercial loans grew organically $13 million, or 1.6%.  
       
  Commercial real estate loans include loans for property and improvements used commercially by the borrower or for lease to others for the production of goods or services.  Over 50% of our commercial real estate loans were owner occupied as of   September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Commercial real estate loans increased $50 million, or 2.8%, to $1,843 million as of September 30, 2016, from $1,793 million as of December 31, 2015, with approximately $27 million of the increase attributable to the Flathead Bank acquisition.  Exclusive of acquired loans, commercial real estate loans grew organically $23 million, or 1.3%.  Management attributes this organic growth in commercial and commercial real estate loans to continued business expansion in within our market areas, particularly in the Billings, Rapid City, Gallatin Valley and Sheridan markets.  
       
  Construction loans are primarily to commercial builders for residential lot development and the construction of single-family residences and commercial real estate properties. Construction loans are generally underwritten pursuant to pre-approved permanent financing. Construction loans increased $47 million, or 10.9%, to $478 million as of September 30, 2016, from $431 million as of December 31, 2015, with approximately $13 million of the increase attributable to the Flathead Bank acquisition.  Exclusive of acquired loans, construction loans grew organically $34 million, or 8.0%, due to organic growth in commercial and residential construction loans. Management attributes this organic growth to continuing increased housing demand and business expansion within our existing markets. 
       
  Our consumer loans include direct personal loans; credit card loans and lines of credit; and, indirect loans created when we purchase consumer loan contracts advanced for the purchase of automobiles, boats and other consumer goods from the consumer product dealer network within the market areas we serve. Personal loans and indirect dealer loans are generally secured by automobiles, recreational vehicles, boats and other types of personal property and are made on an installment basis.  Consumer

loans increased $108 million, or 12.8%, to $952 million as of September 30, 2016, from $844 million as of December 31, 2015, due to organic growth in indirect consumer loans.  Indirect consumer loans grew organically $109 million, or 17.6%, to $732 million as of September 30, 2016, from $623 million as of December 31, 2015, due to the continued expansion of our indirect lending program within our existing markets and increases in the average loan amounts advanced. 
       
  Non-performing Assets.   Non-performing assets include non-accrual loans, loans contractually past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest and OREO.  The following table sets forth information regarding non-performing assets as of the dates indicated.     

Non-performing loans  . Non-performing loans include non-accrual loans and loans contractually past due 90 days or more.  We monitor and evaluate collateral values on non-performing loans quarterly.  Appraisals are required on all non-performing loans every 18-24 months, or sooner as conditions necessitate.  We update valuations on collateral underlying oil and gas credits based on recent market-based oil price forecasts provided by an independent third party.  We also monitor real estate values by market for our larger market areas. Based on trends in real estate values, adjustments may be made to the appraised value based on time elapsed between the appraisal date and the impairment analysis or a new appraisal may be ordered. Appraised values in our smaller market areas may be adjusted based on trends identified through discussions with local realtors and appraisers.  Appraisals are also adjusted for selling costs.  The collateral valuation is then compared to the loan balance and any resulting shortfall is recorded in the allowance for loan losses as a specific valuation allowance. Provisions for loan losses are impacted by changes in the specific valuation allowances and historical or general valuation elements of the allowance for loan losses.      
    
  The following table sets forth the allocation of our non-performing loans among our various loan categories as of the dates indicated.

Table of Contents  

Non-accrual loans  .  We generally place loans, excluding acquired credit impaired loans, on non-accrual when they become 90 days past due, unless they are well secured and in the process of collection. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, any interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed from income.  If all loans on non-accrual had been current in accordance with their original terms, gross income of approximately $2.5 million and $2.3 million would have been accrued for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Non-accrual loans, the largest component of non-performing assets, increased $5 million to $71 million as of September 30, 2016, from $66 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to the loans of four commercial real estate borrowers in the hospitality sector that were placed on non-accrual status during second quarter 2016 and the loans of one agricultural real estate borrower placed on non-accrual status during third quarter 2016.  These increases were partially offset by the pay-off of the loans of one agricultural real estate borrower and one commercial real estate borrower aggregating $7 million.  
       
  Accruing loans past due 90 days or more.    Accruing loans past due 90 days or more increased $3 million, or 45.1%, to $8 million as of September 30, 2016, from $5 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to the loans of one borrower in the energy sector.  
               
  OREO  .  OREO consists of real property acquired through foreclosure on the collateral underlying defaulted loans. We initially record OREO at fair value less estimated selling costs.  Any excess of loan carrying value over the fair value of the real estate acquired is recorded as a charge against the allowance for loan losses.  Estimated losses that result from the ongoing periodic valuation of these properties are charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified.  The fair values of OREO properties are estimated using appraisals and management estimates of current market conditions. OREO properties are appraised every 18-24 months unless deterioration in local market conditions indicates the need to obtain new appraisals sooner. OREO properties are evaluated by management quarterly to determine if additional write-downs are appropriate or necessary based on current market conditions. Quarterly evaluations include a review of the most recent appraisal of the property and reviews of recent appraisals and comparable sales data for similar properties in the same or adjacent market areas. Commercial and agricultural OREO properties are listed with unrelated third party professional real estate agents or brokers local to the areas where the marketed properties are located. Residential properties are typically listed with local realtors, after any redemption period has expired.  We rely on these local real estate agents and/or brokers to list the properties on the local multiple listing system, to provide marketing materials and advertisements for the properties and to conduct open houses.         
           
  OREO increased $3 million, or 51.1%, to $9 million as of September 30, 2016, from $6 million as of December 31, 2015, with approximately $1 million of the increase attributable to the Flathead Bank acquisition.  As of September 30, 2016, the composition of OREO properties was 29% residential real estate, 32% land and land development and 39% commercial. 
       
  Allowance for Loan Losses.    The Company performs a quarterly assessment of the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The methodology used to assess the adequacy is consistently applied to the Company's loan portfolio. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on our evaluation of known and inherent risk in our loan portfolio at each balance sheet date. In determining the allowance for loan losses, we estimate losses on specific loans, or groups of loans, where the probable loss can be identified and reasonably determined. The balance of the allowance for loan losses is based on internally assigned risk classifications of loans, historical loan loss rates, changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, current economic factors and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on certain historical loan loss rates. See the discussion under  Critical Accounting Estimates and Significant Accounting Policies   Allowance for Loan Losses." 
       
  The allowance for loan losses is increased by provisions charged against earnings and net recoveries of charged-off loans and is reduced by negative provisions credited to earnings and net loan charge-offs. The allowance for loan losses consists of three elements:  
               
           (1) 
    Specific valuation allowances associated with impaired loans.  Specific valuation allowances are determined based on assessment of the fair value of the collateral underlying the loans as determined through independent appraisals, the present value of future cash flows, observable market prices and any relevant qualitative or environmental factors impacting the loan.  No specific valuation allowances are recorded for impaired loans that are adequately secured.    
              
           (2) 
    Historical valuation allowances based on loan loss experience for similar loans with similar characteristics and trends. Historical valuation allowances are determined by applying percentage loss factors to the credit exposures from outstanding loans. For commercial, agricultural and real estate loans, loss factors are applied based on the internal risk classifications of these loans. For consumer loans, loss factors are applied on a portfolio basis. For commercial, agriculture and real estate loans, loss factor percentages are based on a migration analysis of our historical loss experience, designed to account for credit deterioration. For consumer loans, loss factor percentages are based on a one-year loss history.

Table of Contents  

(3)   
    General valuation allowances determined based on changes in the nature of the loan portfolio, overall portfolio quality, industry concentrations, delinquency trends, general economic conditions and other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to us.  
       
  Based on the assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, management records provisions for loan losses to maintain the allowance for loan losses at appropriate levels.   
    
  The Company's allowance for loan losses increased to $81 million, or 1.47% of period end loans, as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $77 million, or 1.46% of period end loans, as of December 31, 2015.  During second quarter 2016, management  performed an in-depth review of the qualitative factors used in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses utilizing our loss experience subsequent to the financial crisis. This review resulted in the adjustment of certain qualitative factors. The adjustment of qualitative factors combined with the management's assessment of losses on specific loans with identified weaknesses did not result in a material impact to the overall level of our allowance for loan losses.  
    
  During third quarter 2015, we added a general economic qualitative loss factor to our allowance for loan loss calculation to estimate the potential impact of economic stresses on loans in our markets which are heavily impacted by energy prices.  As of September 30, 2016, our direct exposure to the energy sector was approximately $61 million in outstanding loans, including approximately $45 million related to drilling and extraction activity and approximately $16 million advanced to service companies. We also had commitments to lend an additional $24 million to energy borrowers. Reserves allocated to energy loans as a percentage of total energy loans totaled 12.4% as of September 30, 2016, compared to 7.8% as of December 31, 2015. The increase in reserves allocated to energy loans was primarily due to specific valuation allowances related to the loans of two energy borrowers, an increase in criticized and classified energy sector loans and an increase in the general economic loss factor applied to all loans in markets heavily impacted by energy prices.  
       
  Loans acquired in business combinations are recorded at fair value with no allowance for loan losses on the date of acquisition. Subsequent to the acquisition date, an allowance for loan loss is recorded for the emergence of new probable and estimable losses on loans acquired without evidence of credit impairment.   Loans acquired with evidence of credit impairment are regularly monitored and to the extent that the performance has deteriorated from management's expectations at the date of acquisition, an allowance for loan losses is established. As of September 30, 2016, management determined that an allowance for loan losses related to acquired loans of $433 thousand was required under generally accepted accounting principles.   
               
  Loans, or portions thereof, are charged-off against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectability of the principal is unlikely, or, with respect to consumer installment loans, according to an established delinquency schedule.  Generally, loans are charged-off when (1) there has been no material principal reduction within the previous 90 days and there is no pending sale of collateral or other assets, (2) there is no significant or pending event which will result in principal reduction within the upcoming 90 days, (3) it is clear that we will not be able to collect all or a portion of the loan, (4) payments on the loan are sporadic, will result in an excessive amortization or are not consistent with the collateral held or (5) foreclosure or repossession  actions are pending.  Loan charge-offs do not directly correspond with the receipt of independent appraisals or the use of observable market data if the collateral value is determined to be sufficient to repay the principal balance of the loan.  
       
  If the impaired loan is adequately collateralized, a specific valuation allowance is not recorded.  As such, significant changes in impaired and non-performing loans do not necessarily correspond proportionally with changes in the specific valuation component of the allowance for loan losses.  Additionally, management expects the timing of charge-offs will vary between quarters and will not necessarily correspond proportionally to changes in the allowance for loan losses or changes in non-performing or impaired loans due to timing differences among the initial identification of an impaired loan, recording of a specific valuation allowance for the impaired loan and any resulting charge-off of uncollectible principal.

The following table sets forth information regarding our allowance for loan losses as of and for the periods indicated.   

Although we have established our allowance for loan losses in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the portfolio at all times, future provisions will be subject to on-going evaluations of the risks in the loan portfolio. If the economy declines or asset quality deteriorates, material additional provisions could be required. 
    
  Investment Securities.   We manage our investment portfolio to obtain the highest yield possible, while meeting our risk tolerance and liquidity guidelines and satisfying the pledging requirements for deposits of state and political subdivisions and securities sold under repurchase agreements. Investment securities increased $15 million, or less than 1.0%, to $2,072 million, or 23.1% of total assets, as of September 30, 2016, from $2,058 million, or 23.6% of total assets, as of December 31, 2015. In conjunction with the Flathead Bank acquisition, we acquired investment securities with fair values aggregating $101 million.  Approximately $29 million of these securities were immediately sold.  As of September 30, 2016, the estimated duration of our investment portfolio was 2.4 years, as compared to 2.8 years as of December 31, 2015. 
       
  We evaluate our investment portfolio quarterly for other-than-temporary declines in the market value of individual investment securities. This evaluation includes monitoring credit ratings; market, industry and corporate news; volatility in market prices; and,  determining  whether  the  market  value  of  a  security  has  been  below  its  cost  for  an  extended  period  of  time.  As of September 30, 2016, we had investment securities with fair values aggregating $143 million that had been in a continuous loss position more than twelve months. Gross unrealized losses on these securities of $4.2 million as of September 30, 2016 were attributable to changes in interest rates. No impairment losses were recorded during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

Cash and Cash Equivalents.   Cash and cash equivalents decreased $79 million, or 10.1%, to $701 million as of                       September 30, 2016, from $780 million as of December 31, 2015.  Exclusive of net cash and cash equivalents acquired as part of the Flathead Bank acquisition, cash and cash equivalents decreased $98 million, or 12.5%, from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. During the first nine months of 2016, organic loan growth and stock repurchases were primarily funded through available funds resulting in decreases in cash and cash equivalents.  Remaining decreases in cash and cash equivalents occurred during the normal course of business and are not reflective of changes in business plan or strategy.       
  Company-Owned Life Insurance.    Company-owned life insurance increased $10 million, or 5.2%, to $197 million as of September 30, 2015, from $187 million as of December 31, 2015, with $6 million of the increase attributable to the Flathead Bank acquisition.  The remaining increase was due to increases in the cash surrender values of existing company-owned life insurance policies.  
    
  Deposits.   Our deposits consist of non-interest bearing and interest bearing demand, savings, individual retirement and time deposit accounts. Total deposits increased $240 million, or 3.4%, to $7,329 million as of September 30, 2016, from $7,089 million as of December 31, 2015, with approximately $210 million of the increase attributable to the Flathead Bank acquisition. Exclusive of the Flathead Bank acquisition, total deposits increased $30 million, or less than 1.0%, due to organic growth.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we continued to experience a shift in the mix of deposits away from higher costing time deposits to lower costing demand deposits.  
    
  The following table summarizes our deposits as of the dates indicated. 

Securities Sold Under Repurchase Agreements.    In addition to deposits, repurchase agreements with commercial depositors, including municipalities, provide an additional source of funds.  Under repurchase agreements, deposit balances are invested in short-term U.S. government agency securities overnight and are then repurchased the following day.  Repurchase agreement balances decreased $34 million, or 6.6%, to $477 million as of September 30, 2016, from $511 million as of December 31, 2015.  Fluctuations in repurchase agreement balances correspond with fluctuations in the liquidity of our customers. 
    
  Deferred Tax Liability.    Our net deferred tax liability increased $5 million, or 52.5%, to $15 million as of September 30, 2016, from $10 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to increases in deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized gains on available-for sale investment securities.  
    
  Capital Resources and Liquidity Management 
       
  Stockholders  equity is influenced primarily by earnings, dividends, sales and redemptions of common stock and changes in the unrealized holding gains or losses, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities.  Stockholders  equity increased $32 million, or 3.4%, to $983 million as of September 30, 2016, from $950 million as of December 31, 2015, primarily due to the retention of earnings and increases in unrealized holding gains, net of taxes, on available-for-sale investment securities.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased and retired 975,877 shares of our Class A common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate purchase price of $26 million.  The repurchases were made pursuant to a stock repurchase program approved by our Board of Directors. For additional information regarding the repurchase, see  Note 8   Capital Stock  in the accompanying  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  included in this report.

On October 21, 2016, we declared a quarterly dividend to common stockholders of $0.22 per share payable on                         November 14, 2016 to to shareholders of record as of October 31, 2016.  This dividend equates to a 3.0% annual yield based on the $29.83 average closing price of the Company's common stock during third quarter 2016.  
           
  On July 2, 2013, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank issued a final rule implementing a revised regulatory capital framework for U.S. banks in accordance with the Basel III international accord, or Basel III. Under Basel II, certain deductions and adjustments to regulatory capital began phasing in starting January 1, 2015 and will be fully implemented on January 1, 2018. The capital conservation buffer phases in beginning January 1, 2016 and will be fully implemented on                 January 1, 2019.  As of  September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had capital levels that, in all cases, exceeded the well-capitalized guidelines.  For additional information regarding our capital levels, see "Note 10   Regulatory Capital  in the accompanying  Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements  included in this report. 
    
  Liquidity.   Liquidity measures our ability to meet current and future cash flow needs on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. We manage our liquidity position to meet the daily cash flow needs of customers, while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the return on investment objectives of our shareholders. Our liquidity position is supported by management of liquid assets and liabilities and access to alternative sources of funds. Liquid assets include cash, interest bearing deposits in banks, federal funds sold, available-for-sale investment securities and maturing or prepaying balances in our held-to-maturity investment and loan portfolios. Liquid liabilities include core deposits, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and borrowings. Other sources of liquidity include the sale of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market funds through non-core deposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, additional borrowings through the Federal Reserve s discount window and the issuance of preferred or common securities. 
  Our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements are primarily to fund on-going operations, including payment of interest on deposits and debt, extensions of credit to borrowers, capital expenditures and shareholder dividends. These liquidity requirements are met primarily through cash flow from operations, redeployment of prepaying and maturing balances in our loan and investment portfolios, debt financing and increases in customer deposits. For additional information regarding our operating, investing and financing cash flows, see the unaudited  Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows,  included in Part I, Item 1. 
  As a holding company, we are a corporation separate and apart from the Bank and, therefore, we provide for our own liquidity. Our main sources of funding include management fees and dividends declared and paid by the Bank and access to capital markets. There are statutory, regulatory and debt covenant limitations that affect the ability of our subsidiary bank to pay dividends to us. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. 
  Management continuously monitors our liquidity position and adjustments are made to the balance between sources and uses of funds as deemed appropriate. Our management is not aware of any events that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital resources or operations. In addition, our management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity, which if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on us.

  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
       
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective disclosure controls and procedures, as defined under Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act. As of   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was performed, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods required by the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
       
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
       
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, such control. 
       
  Limitations on Controls and Procedures 
       
  The effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting is subject to various inherent limitations, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions about the likelihood of future events, the soundness of our systems, the possibility of human error, and the risk of fraud. Moreover, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions and the risk that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate over time. Because of these limitations, any system of disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting may not be successful in preventing all errors or fraud or in making all material information known in a timely manner to the appropriate levels of management.

Exhibit 31.1  
  CERTIFICATION BY CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER  
  PURSUANT TO RULE 13a-14(a) AND RULE 15d-14(a)  
  UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED 
    
  I, Kevin P. Riley, certify that :  
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of First Interstate BancSystem, Inc; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d. 
    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions); 
              a. 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and
