Part
I - FINANCIAL INFORMATION   

GOLD DYNAMICS CORP.  

  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

 October 31, 2016 

  Note 1: Organization and Basis of Presentation  

Gold Dynamics Corp. (the  Company ) is a for profit
corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada, United States of America on April, 2006. 

The Company's primary operations began in April 2006 with an e-commerce
focus and intends to become a producer of vitamin infused alcoholic beverages. As part of the change in operations, the Company
has undergone a name change from Revo Ventures Inc. to Vita Spirits Corp to Gold Dynamics Corp. to better reflect the Company's
new focus. 

The Financial Statements and related disclosures as of October 31,
2016 are unaudited pursuant to the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).
The October 31, 2016, Balance Sheet data was derived from unaudited financial statements and does not include all disclosures required
by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. ). Certain information and footnote
disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In our opinion, these financial
statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the results
for the period. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Quarterly
Report for the period ended October 31, 2016. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to  Gold Dynamics, 
 we,   us,   our  or the  company  are to Gold Dynamics Corp. and any subsidiaries. 

The Company s fiscal year ends July 31. 

Note 2: Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Disclosures about
Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, ( ASU 2011-11 ). ASU 2011-11 requires an entity to disclose both gross information
and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments
and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. ASU 201111 is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. Retrospective disclosure is required
for all comparative periods presented. The adoption of ASU 2011-11 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial
statements. 

In October 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-04, Technical Corrections
and Improvements, ( ASU 2012-04 ). This update includes source literature amendments, guidance clarification, reference
corrections and relocated guidance affecting a variety of topics in the Codification. The update also includes conforming amendments
to the Codification to reflect ASC 820 s fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. The amendments in this update
that will not have transition guidance are effective upon issuance. The amendments in this update that are subject to the transition
guidance will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2012-04 did not have a material
impact on the Company s financial statements. 

In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet
(Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ( ASU 2013-01 ). This update
clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables are not in the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures
about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ( ASU 2011-11 ). Specifically, ASU 2011-11 applies only to derivatives, repurchase
agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset
in accordance with specific criteria contained in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification or subject to a master netting arrangement
or similar agreement. The Company is required to apply the amendments in ASU 2013-01 beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of
ASU 2013-01 by the Company did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued
Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of Accumulated
Other Comprehensive Income. This update requires companies to provide information regarding the amounts reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income by component. In addition, companies are required to present, either on the face of the statement where
net income is presented or in the accompanying notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income
by the respective line items of net income. ASU 2013-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after December
15, 2012, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU 2013-02 was adopted January 1, 2013 and did not have a significant
impact on our financial statements. 

Note 3: Commitments and Contingencies  

The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property,
an officer has provided office services without charge. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are
not reflected herein. The officer and director are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in
other business activities in the future. 

Note 4: Legal Matters  

The Company has no known legal issues pending. 

Note 5: Related Party Transactions  

An officer has loaned the Company $15,937 on August 1, 2009, without
a fixed term of repayment and no interest. 

Note 6: Capital Stock  

On July 14, 2006, the Company sold 5,000,000 common shares at $0.001
per share to the sole director of the Company for total proceeds of $5,000. 

 On May 6, 2007, the Company sold 2,100,000 common shares pursuant
to a registration statement at $0.01 per share for total proceeds of $21,000. 

 On April 22, 2008, the Company approved a forward split of a 15
for 2 forward stock split to the stockholders of record as of April 23, 2008. The Company increased the authorized shares from
50,000,000 to 75,000,000. The Company did not change the par value of the shares. All references to share value in these financial
statements have been restated to reflect this split. Subsequent to the forward split, the Company had 53,250,000 common shares
issued and outstanding. 

 On November 12, 2009, the Company sold 4,000,000 common shares at
$ 0.0125 per share to an investor for total proceeds of $50,000. 

 On December 15, 2009, the Company authorized a Forward Stock Split
of issued and outstanding Common Stock on a 2.6 for one (2.6:1) basis. As a result of the Forward Stock Split, the Company increased
its issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock to 148,850,000. 

The number of shares outstanding of the Registrant's common stock,
par value $.001 per share, at October 31, 2016 was 148,850,000 shares. 

As of October 31, 2016 there were no outstanding stock options or
warrants. 

Note 7: Income Taxes  

The company has not commenced operations and has not generated any
revenue and has not made a provision for income taxes. 

 The Company s statutory tax rate is 35%. 

 The Company does not have any material uncertainties with respect
to its provisions for income taxes. 

Note 8: Going Concern  

The accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. 

 The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
upon the Company s ability to generate sufficient revenues to operate profitably or raise additional capital through debt
financing and/or through sales of common stock. 

Management has no formal plan in place to address these concerns,
but believes that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds through equity financing and/or related party advances. 

 The failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability or
obtain the additional funding would be detrimental to the Company. 

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

This 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results
could differ materially from those set forth as a result of general economic conditions and changes in the assumptions used in
making such forward-looking statements. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations
should be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and the other financial information
appearing elsewhere in this report. The analysis set forth below is provided pursuant to applicable Securities and Exchange Commission
regulations and is not intended to serve as a basis for projections of future events. Refer also to  Cautionary Note Regarding
Forward Looking Statements  and  Risk Factors  below. 

The following discussion and analysis provides information which
management of Gold Dynamics Corp. (the  Company ) believes to be relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company's
results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read together with the Company's financial statements
and the notes to financial statements, which are included in this report. 

CAUTION ABOUT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

This management's discussion and analysis or plan of operation should
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto of the Company for the quarter ended October 31, 2016. Because
of the nature of a relatively new and growing company the reported results will not necessarily reflect the future. 

This section includes a number of forward-looking statements that
reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified
by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature,
refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date
of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. 

COMPANY OVERVIEW  

Gold Dynamics Corp.'s primary operations began in April 2006. Gold
Dynamics Corp. is an emerging precious metals explorer focused on under explored regions of the world that is seeking to grow shareholder
value by building gold and silver mineral resources through systematic exploration. The Company has brought together a highly experienced
board and management team consisting of capable professionals with significant development and mine management experience. 

Gold Dynamics Corp. seeks to identify, acquire, and develop deposits
which have the potential to be world class and in an acceptable risk environment. Social responsibility and environmental stewardship
are core values of the Company. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The Company experienced general and administration expenses of $nil
and $1,250 for the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

 For the three-month period ended October 31, 2016, the net loss
of the Company is $nil. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

During the three-month period ended October 31, 2016, the Company
had no working capital needs. As of October 31, 2016, the Company has cash on hand in the amount of $nil. Management does not expect
that the current level of cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve-month period. In the event
that additional funds are required to maintain operations, our officers and directors have agreed to advance us sufficient capital
to allow us to continue operations. We may also be able to obtain loans from our shareholders, but there are no agreements or understandings
in place currently. 

We believe we will require additional funding to expand our business
and ensure its future profitability. We anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the
sale of our common stock. However, we do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing. In the event we are
not successful in selling our common stock, we may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our director. 

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS  

 Not applicable 

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

 We carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the
participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act (defined below)). Based
upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period
covered in this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all error
or fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that
the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource
constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control
systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have
been detected. Accordingly, management believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material
respects our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

 In addition, our management with the participation of our Principal
Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have determined that no change in our internal control over financial reporting
occurred during or subsequent to the quarter ended October 31, 2016 that has materially affected, or is (as that term is defined
in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. 

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION  

  ITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

 We know of no material, existing or pending legal proceedings against
our company, nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. There are no proceedings in which
any of our directors, officers or affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material
interest adverse to our interest.
