1.
Business Description, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies   

Business
Description:    

ClearOne,
Inc. together with its subsidiaries (collectively,  ClearOne  or the  Company ) is a global company that
designs, develops and sells conferencing, collaboration, streaming and digital signage solutions for audio and visual communications.
The performance and simplicity of its advanced comprehensive solutions offer unprecedented levels of functionality, reliability
and scalability.  

Basis
of Presentation:    

The
fiscal year for ClearOne is the 12 months ending on December 31 st . The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of ClearOne and its subsidiaries. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  

These
accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
and are not audited. Certain information and footnote disclosures that are usually included in financial statements prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) have been either condensed
or omitted in accordance with SEC rules and regulations. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements contain
all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and
the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full-year period. These interim unaudited
condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.  

Significant
Accounting Policies:    

The
significant accounting policies were described in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s
annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no changes to these policies during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 that are of significance or potential significance to the Company.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements:    

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), requiring an entity to recognize the
amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated
standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of
either a full retrospective or retrospective with cumulative effect transition method. The updated standard becomes effective
for the Company on January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently
evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), simplifying the presentation of deferred taxes on the balance
sheet by requiring companies to classify everything as either a non-current asset or non-current liability. Early adoption of
this ASU is permitted. ClearOne has adopted this standard update early as it simplified the presentation of taxes on the balance
sheet and within the income tax footnote.  

In
February 2016, FASB released Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to bring transparency to lessee balance
sheets. The ASU will require organizations that lease assets (lessees) to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The standard will apply to both types
of leases-capital (or finance) leases and operating leases. Previously, GAAP has required only capital leases to be recognized
on lessee balance sheets. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application will be permitted for all organizations. The Company has not
yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated
financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting.
The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income
tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company on January
1, 2017 and we are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires
measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning
January 1, 2020 and we are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight specific
cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company beginning
January 1, 2018 and we are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

The
following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per common share:  

3.
Marketable Securities   

The
Company has classified its marketable securities as available-for-sale securities. These securities are carried at estimated fair
value with unrealized holding gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss in stockholders 
equity until realized. Gains and losses on marketable security transactions are reported on the specific-identification method.
Dividend and interest income are recognized when earned.  

The
amortized cost, gross unrealized holding gains, gross unrealized holding losses, and fair value for available-for-sale securities
by major security type and class of securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:

Maturities of marketable securities classified as available-for-sale
securities were as follows at September 30, 2016: 

Debt
securities in an unrealized loss position as of September 30, 2016 were not deemed impaired at acquisition and subsequent declines
in fair value are not deemed attributed to declines in credit quality. Management believes that it is more likely than not that
the securities will receive a full recovery of par value. The available-for-sale marketable securities in a gross unrealized loss
position as of September 30, 2016 are summarized as follows:

Inventories   

Inventories,
net of reserves, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:  

Long-term
inventory represents inventory held in excess of our current (next 12 months) requirements based on our recent sales and forecasted
level of sales. We expect to sell the above inventory, net of reserves, at or above the stated cost and believe that no loss will
be incurred on its sale, although there can be no assurance of the timing or amount of any sales.  

Current
finished goods do not include consigned inventory in the amounts of approximately $1,538 and $1,628 as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. Distributor channel inventories represent inventories at distributors and other customers where
revenue recognition criteria have not yet been achieved.  

The
following table summarizes the losses incurred on valuation of inventory at lower of cost or market value and write-off of obsolete
inventory during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Share-based Compensation   

Employee
Stock Option Plans    

The
Company s share-based incentive plans offering stock options primarily consists of two plans. Under both plans, one new
share is issued for each stock option exercised. The plans are described below.  

The
Company s 1998 Incentive Plan (the  1998 Plan ) was the Company s primary plan through November 2007.
Under this plan shares of common stock were made available for issuance to employees and directors. Through December 1999, 1,066,000
options were granted that would cliff vest after 9.8 years; however, such vesting was accelerated for 637,089 of these options
upon meeting certain earnings per share goals through the fiscal year ended September 30, 2003. Subsequent to December 1999 and
through September 2002, 1,248,250 options were granted that would cliff vest after 6.0 years; however, such vesting was accelerated
for 300,494 of these options upon meeting certain earnings per share goals through the fiscal year ended September 30, 2005.  

The
Company s 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2007 Plan ) was restated and approved by the shareholders on December
12, 2014. Provisions of the restated 2007 Plan include the granting of up to 2,000,000 incentive and non-qualified stock options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units. Options may be granted to employees, officers, non-employee
directors and other service providers and may be granted upon such terms as the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
determines in their sole discretion.  

Of
the options granted subsequent to September 2002, all vesting schedules are based on 3 or 4-year vesting schedules, with either
one-third or one-fourth vesting on the first anniversary and the remaining options vesting ratably over the remainder of the vesting
term. Generally, directors and officers have 3-year vesting schedules and all other employees have 4-year vesting schedules. Additionally,
in the event of a change in control or the occurrence of a corporate transaction, the Company s Board of Directors has the
authority to elect that all unvested options shall vest and become exercisable immediately prior to the event or closing of the
transaction. All options outstanding as of September 30, 2016 had contractual lives of ten years. Under the 1998 Plan, 2,500,000
shares were authorized for grant. As of September 30, 2016, there were 150,000 options outstanding under the 1998 Plan, which
includes the cliff vesting and 3 or 4-year vesting options discussed above. As of September 30, 2016, there were 691,816 options
outstanding under the 2007 Plan. As of September 30, 2016, the 2007 Plan had 859,410 authorized unissued options, while there
were no options remaining that could be granted under the 1998 Plan.

A summary of the stock option activity under
the Company s plans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

As
of September 30, 2016, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock options, net of forfeitures,
was approximately $1,229, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.38 years.  

Stock
Option Repurchase:    From March 11, 2016 to March 17, 2016, the Company offered to repurchase eligible vested options
to purchase shares under the 1998 Plan and the 2007 Plan from employees. The Company repurchased delivered options at a repurchase
price equal to the difference between the closing market price on the date of the employee s communication of accepting
the repurchase offer and the exercise price of such employee s delivered options, subject to applicable withholding taxes
and charges. The Company repurchased 225,542 stock options from employees at an average purchase price of $7.77.  

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan    

The
Company issues shares to employees under the Company s 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the  ESPP ). The ESPP
was approved by the Company s shareholders on December 12, 2014. As of September 30, 2016, 480,444 of the originally approved
500,000 shares were available for offerings under the ESPP. Offering periods under the ESPP commence on each January 1 and July
1, and continue for a duration of nine months. The ESPP is available to all employees who do not own, or not are deemed to own,
shares of stock making up an excess of 5% of the combined voting power of the Company, its parent or subsidiary. During each offering
period, each eligible employee may purchase shares under the ESPP after authorizing payroll deductions. Under the ESPP, each employee
may purchase up to the lesser of 2,500 shares or $25 of fair market value (based on the established purchase price) of the Company s
stock for each offering period. Unless the employee has previously withdrawn from the offering, his or her accumulated payroll
deductions will be used to purchase common stock on the last business day of the period at a price equal to 85% (or a 15% discount)
of the fair market value of the common stock on the first or last day of the offering period, whichever is lower.  

Share-based
compensation expense has been recorded as follows:

Shareholders  Equity   

The
following table summarizes the change in shareholders  equity during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively:  

On
August 10, 2016, the Company announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share which was paid on September 7, 2016 to shareholders
of record as of August 24, 2016.  

8.
Fair Value Measurements   

The
fair value of the Company s financial instruments reflects the amounts that the Company estimates it will receive in connection
with the sale of an asset or pay in connection with the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date (exit price). The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the use of inputs used in valuation techniques into
the following three levels:  

Level
1  - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.  

Level
2  - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; quoted prices in markets
that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the
full term of the assets or liabilities. This category generally includes U.S. Government and agency securities; municipal securities;
mutual funds and securities sold and not yet settled.  

Level
3  - Unobservable inputs.  

The
substantial majority of the Company s financial instruments are valued using quoted prices in active markets or based on
other observable inputs. The following table sets forth the fair value of the financial instruments re-measured by the Company
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

9.
Income Taxes   

The
Company s forecasted effective tax rate at September 30, 2016 is 32.3%, a 3.5% decrease from the 35.8% effective tax rate
recorded at December 31, 2015. The forecasted effective tax rate of 32.3% excludes jurisdictions for which no benefit from forecasted
current year losses is anticipated. Including losses from such jurisdictions results in a forecasted effective tax rate of 33.3%.
Our forecasted effective tax rate could fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis and could change, to the extent that earnings
in countries with tax rates that differ from that of the U.S. differ, from amounts anticipated at September 30, 2016.  

After
a discrete tax benefit of $303, the effective tax rate for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 is 28.0%. The discrete tax benefit
is primarily attributable to a tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and changes in estimated R D tax credits.

Our
revenues were $12.9 million and $15.9 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The revenues
mainly decreased due to overall fall in demand for our products in most major markets. The revenues for three months ended September
30, 2015 also included three quarters of licensing fees reflecting the execution of a licensing agreement in Q3 of 2015 even though
the fees were due from the beginning of 2015 as per the terms of the agreement. The revenues for three months ended September
30, 2015 also had the benefit of three quarters of revenue from licensing fees. Our gross profit decreased by $2.5 million during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit declined primarily
due to reduction in revenue and due to unfavorable change in product revenue and licensing fees mix. Net income decreased by $1.2
million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net income for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased primarily due to reduction in revenues and associated gross profit, partially
offset by savings due to reductions in operating expenses.  

Our
revenues were $37.9 million and $43.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The revenues
decreased due to an overall fall in demand for our products in all major markets. Our gross profit decreased by $3.8 million during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net income decreased by $1.7 million
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net income for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 decreased primarily due to reduction in revenues and associated gross profit, partially offset
by savings due to reductions in operating expenses.  

Future
revenue growth and income growth are dependent on the recovery of the global economy and the success of CONVERGE Pro 2, our new
professional audio conferencing platform that we launched in June 2016 and that will replace our current generation of CONVERGE
Pro products. We closely monitor the economic situation around the world and have developed sound operating and financial plans
to overcome the challenges posed by the weak economy. Sequentially, our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016
grew approximately $900,000, a 7.9% increase as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, representing the first sequential
quarterly increase in revenues since the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

A
detailed discussion of our results of operations follows below.  

Results
of Operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    

The
following table sets forth certain items from our unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations (dollars in thousands)
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, together with the percentage of total revenue which
each such item represents:  

Revenue    

Revenue
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $12.9 million, compared to $15.9 million in the three months ended
September 30, 2015, which included three quarters of licensing fees reflecting the execution of a licensing agreement in Q3 of
2015 even though the fees were due from the beginning of 2015 as per the terms of the agreement. This decrease of approximately
19% is partly due to lower licensing fees and mainly due to reduced demand for our products across most regions including North
America.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Revenue
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $37.9 million, a decrease of approximately 13% compared to the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenue was due to reduced demand for our products across most regions.
The decrease was especially stronger in the Middle East, South Africa, Asia Pacific, Northern and Central Europe and Canada. The
increase in revenues from video products was more than offset by a decline in revenues from all other product lines.  

The net change in deferred revenue during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from December 31, 2015 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 from December 31,
2014 was a net decrease in deferred revenue of $0.3 million and $0.2 million, respectively. See  Critical Accounting Policies
and Estimates  under  Revenue and Associated Allowance for Revenue Adjustments and Doubtful Accounts  below
for a detailed discussion of deferred revenue. 

Costs
of Goods Sold and Gross Profit    

Costs
of goods sold include expenses associated with finished goods purchased from electronic manufacturing services (EMS) providers,
in addition to other operating expenses, which include material and direct labor, our manufacturing and operations organization,
property and equipment depreciation, warranty expenses, freight expenses, royalty payments, and the allocation of overhead expenses.  

Our
gross profit margin (GPM), which is gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from 64% in the three months ended September
30, 2015 to 59% in the three months ended September 30, 2016. The reduction in gross profit margin for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was mainly due to a reduction of high margin products in the revenue mix and higher licensing fees in the three
months ended September 30, 2015 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016. The gross profit margin also reduced
due to higher inventory scrapping costs arising out of moving our manufacturing facility that we acquired along with Sabine to
an overseas outsourced manufacturing facility.  

Our
GPM was 63% and 64% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in GPM was primarily due
to a reduction of high margin products in the revenue mix.  

Our
profitability in the near-term continues to depend significantly on our revenues from professional audio conferencing products,
which includes wired and wireless microphones. We hold long-term inventory and if we are unable to sell our long-term inventory,
our profitability might be affected by inventory write-offs and price mark-downs.  

Operating
Expenses    

Operating
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by 7% to $6.2 million from $6.7 million for three months ended
September 30, 2015. Operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by approximately $0.9 million to
$19.1 million compared to $19.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Sales
and Marketing ( S M ) Expenses.  S M expenses include selling, customer service, and marketing expenses,
such as employee-related costs, allocations of overhead expenses, trade shows, and other advertising and selling expenses.  

S M
expenses of approximately $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.4 million when compared to
S M expenses of $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was mainly due to reduction in commissions
to independent agents and tradeshow costs.  

S M
expenses of approximately $7.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $0.4 million, or 5%, when compared
to S M expenses of approximately $8.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decreases in employee related
costs, commissions to employees and independent agents and tradeshow costs were partially offset by marketing, tradeshow costs
and consulting expenses.  

Research
and Development ( R D ) Expenses.  R D expenses include research and development and product line management,
including employee-related costs, outside services, expensed materials and depreciation, and an allocation of overhead expenses.  

R D
expenses of approximately $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 remained almost unchanged from $2.1 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

R D
expenses of approximately $6.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.4 million, or 6%, when compared
to R D expenses of approximately $6.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. R D expenses increased mainly
due to increases in costs for various R D projects and employee related costs.  

General
and Administrative ( G A ) Expenses.  G A expenses include employee-related costs, professional service
fees, allocations of overhead expenses, litigation costs, and corporate administrative costs, including finance, information technology
and human resources.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

G A
expenses of approximately $1.74 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 remained almost unchanged from $1.8 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

G A
expenses of approximately $4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.8 million, or 14%, when compared
to G A expenses of approximately $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. G A expenses decreased due
to decreases in legal expenses, audit and accounting fees, and acquisition related amortization costs and other expenses, and
due to elimination of compensation expense relating to dividend equivalents. These decreases were partially offset by an increase
in recruitment costs and increase in allocation of overhead costs.  

Other
income (expense), net    

Other
income (expense), net, includes interest income, interest expense, and currency gain (loss).  

Provision
for income taxes    

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we accrued income taxes at the forecasted effective tax rate of 32.3% as compared to
the forecasted effective tax rate of 36.3% used during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The 4.0% decrease in the forecasted
effective tax rate was primarily due to the U.S. research and development tax credit, which was in effect for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, but had not been extended as of September 30, 2015. In addition, a discrete tax benefit of $303 thousand
is primarily attributable to a tax benefit related to stock-based compensation and changes in 2015 estimated R D tax credits.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

As
of September 30, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $12.2 million, a decrease of approximately $1.2 million
compared to cash and cash equivalents of approximately $13.4 million as of December 31, 2015.  

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $7.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase in cash flow
of approximately $1.1 million compared to $6.4 million of cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to changes in operating assets and liabilities totaling $3.6 million
partially offset by reduction in non-cash charges by $0.9 million and a decrease in net income of $1.7 million.  

Net
cash used in investing activities was approximately $1.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase
of $0.8 million compared to $1.0 million of cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The increase in cash used in investing activities in nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to an increase of about $0.5
million in purchase of property and equipment and $0.3 million in purchases of marketable securities net of proceeds from maturities
and sales of marketable securities.  

Net
cash used in financing activities was approximately $6.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.3
million of cash used in financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Financing activities during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily consisted of cash outflows of $5.1 million towards stock repurchases, $1.8 million
for the repurchase of stock options and $1.4 million for dividend payments partially offset by cash inflows of about $0.7 million
from exercises of stock options and $0.7 million from tax benefits from exercise of stock options. Financing activities during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily consisted of cash outflows of $0.6 million towards dividend payments partially
offset by cash inflows of about $0.3 million from proceeds from exercises of stock options and $49 thousand from tax benefits
from exercise of stock options.  

As
of September 30, 2016, our working capital was $33.4 million as compared to $36.5 million as of December 31, 2015.  

We
believe that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to meet
our short-term and long-term operating requirements and finance our growth plans. We also believe that our strong financial position
and sound business structure will enable us to raise additional capital if and when needed to meet our short and long-term financing
needs. In addition to capital expenditures, we may use cash in the near future for selective infusions of technology, sales  
marketing, infrastructure, and other investments to fuel our growth, as well as acquisitions that may strategically fit our business
and are accretive to our performance. We may also use cash to pay cash dividends or repurchase stock.  

At September 30, 2016, we had open purchase
orders related to our electronics manufacturing service providers of approximately $5.2 million, primarily related to inventory
purchases. 

At September 30, 2016, we had inventory totaling $15.2 million, of which non-current
inventory accounted for $1.7 million. This compares to total inventories of $15.5 million and non-current inventory of $2.0 million
as of December 31, 2015.

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance-sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial conditions, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources, results of operations or liquidity.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

Our
discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial position are based upon our consolidated financial statements,
which have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We review the accounting policies used
in reporting our financial results on a regular basis. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate
our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations. We believe that
the estimates we use are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Our
significant accounting policies are described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe
the following critical accounting policies identify our most critical accounting policies, which are the policies that are both
important to the representation of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments,
often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  

Revenue
and Associated Allowances for Revenue Adjustments and Doubtful Accounts    

Included
in continuing operations is product revenue, primarily from product sales to distributors, dealers, and end-users. Product revenue
is recognized when (i) the products are shipped and any right of return expires, (ii) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
(iii) the price is fixed and determinable, and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.  

We
provide a right of return on product sales to certain distributors under a product rotation program. Under this seldom-used program,
once a quarter, a distributor is allowed to return products purchased during the prior quarter for a total value generally not
exceeding 15% of the distributor s net purchases during the preceding quarter. The distributor is, however, required to
place a new purchase order for an amount not less than the value of products returned under the stock rotation program. When products
are returned, the associated revenue, cost of goods sold, inventory and accounts receivable originally recorded are reversed.
When the new order is placed, the revenue, associated cost of goods sold, inventory and accounts receivable are recorded and the
product revenue is subject to the deferral analysis described below. In a small number of cases, the distributors are also permitted
to return the products for other business reasons.  

Revenue
from product sales to distributors is not recognized until the return privilege has expired or until it can be determined with
reasonable certainty that the return privilege has expired, which approximates when the product is sold-through to customers of
our distributors (dealers, system integrators, value-added resellers, and end-users), rather than when the product is initially
shipped to a distributor. At each quarter-end, we evaluate the inventory in the distribution channel through information provided
by our distributors. The level of inventory in the channel will fluctuate up or down each quarter based upon our distributors 
individual operations. Accordingly, each quarter-end deferral of revenue and associated cost of goods sold are calculated and
recorded based upon the actual channel inventory reported at quarter-end. Further, with respect to distributors and other channel
partners not reporting the channel inventory, the revenue and associated cost of goods sold are deferred until we receive payment
for the product sales made to such distributors or channel partners.  

The
accuracy of the deferred revenue and costs depend to a large extent on the accuracy of the inventory reports provided by our distributors
and other resellers and any material error in those reports would affect our revenue deferral. However, we believe that the controls
we have in place, including periodic physical inventory verifications and analytical reviews, would help us identify and prevent
any material errors in such reports.  

The
amount of deferred cost of goods sold was included in distributor channel inventories. The following table details the amount
of deferred revenue, cost of goods sold, and gross profit (in thousands) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

We
offer rebates and market development funds to certain of our distributors, dealers/resellers, and end-users based upon volume
of product purchased by them. We record rebates as a reduction of revenue in accordance with GAAP.

CLEARONE,

   MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

We
offer credit terms on the sale of our products to a majority of our channel partners and perform ongoing credit evaluations of
our customers  financial condition. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the
inability or unwillingness of our channel partners to make required payments based upon our historical collection experience and
expected collectability of all accounts receivable. Our actual bad debts in future periods may differ from our current estimates
and the differences may be material, which may have an adverse impact on our future accounts receivable and cash position.  

Impairment
of Goodwill and Intangible Assets    

Goodwill
is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible
assets acquired less liabilities assumed. We perform impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful
lives on an annual basis in the fourth fiscal quarter, or sooner if a triggering event occurs suggesting possible impairment of
the values of these assets. There were no impairments recorded in the Nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015 as no impairment
indicators existed. However, due to uncertainty in the industrial, technological, and competitive environments in which we operate,
we might be required to exit or dispose of the assets acquired through our acquisitions, which could result in an impairment of
goodwill and intangible assets.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets    

We
assess the impairment of long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and definite-lived intangibles subject to amortization,
annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated future
undiscounted net cash flows of the related asset or group of assets over their remaining lives. If the carrying amount of an asset
exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying
amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Impairment of long-lived assets is assessed at the lowest levels for which
there are identifiable cash flows that are independent of other groups of assets. The impairment of long-lived assets requires
judgments and estimates. If circumstances change, such estimates could also change. Assets held for sale are reported at the lower
of the carrying amount or fair value, less the estimated costs to sell.  

Accounting
for Income Taxes    

We
are subject to income taxes in both the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions. We estimate our current tax position
together with our future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items, such
as deferred revenue, depreciation, and other reserves for tax and accounting purposes. These temporary differences result in deferred
tax assets and liabilities. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable
income, prior year carryback, or future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. To the extent we believe that recovery
is not more likely than not, we establish a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets. Significant judgment is required
in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against
our deferred tax assets.  

To
the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period, we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision
in the consolidated statement of operations. In accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes , we analyzed
our valuation allowance at December 31, 2015 and determined that based upon available evidence it is more likely than not that
certain of our deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign intangible assets will not
be realized and, accordingly, we have recorded a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets in the amount of $1.1 million.  

Lower-of-Cost
or Market Adjustments and Reserves for Excess and Obsolete Inventory    

We
account for our inventory on a first-in, first-out basis, and make appropriate adjustments on a quarterly basis to write down
the value of inventory to the lower-of-cost or market. In addition to the price of the product purchased, the cost of inventory
includes our internal manufacturing costs, including warehousing, material purchasing, quality and product planning expenses.  

We
perform a quarterly analysis of obsolete and slow-moving inventory to determine if any inventory needs to be written down. In
general, we write down our excess and obsolete inventory by an amount that is equal to the difference between the cost of the
inventory and its estimated market value if market value is less than cost, based upon assumptions about future product life-cycles,
product demand, shelf life of the product, inter-changeability of the product and market conditions. Those items that are found
to have a supply in excess of our estimated current demand are considered to be slow-moving or obsolete and classified as long-term.
An appropriate reserve is made to write down the value of that inventory to its expected realizable value. These charges are recorded
in cost of goods sold. The reserve against slow-moving or obsolete inventory is increased or reduced based on several factors
which, among other things, require us to make an estimate of a product s life-cycle, potential demand and our ability to
sell these products at estimated price levels. While we make considerable efforts to calculate reasonable estimates of these variables,
actual results may vary. If there were to be a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products, or if there were a
higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements, we could be required to increase
our inventory allowances and our gross profit could be adversely affected.

Compensation    

In
December 2004, the FASB issued guidelines now contained under FASB ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation .
ASC Topic 718 establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for
goods or services. Primarily, ASC Topic 718 focuses on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services
in share-based payment transactions. It also addresses transactions in which an entity incurs liabilities in exchange for goods
or services that are based on the fair value of the entity s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of
those equity instruments.  

Under
ASC Topic 718, we measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant
date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee
is required to provide services in exchange for the awards   the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).
No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service. Therefore,
if an employee does not ultimately render the requisite service, the costs associated with the unvested options will not be recognized
cumulatively.  

Under
ASC Topic 718, we recognize compensation cost net of an anticipated forfeiture rate and recognize the associated compensation
cost for those awards expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. We use judgment in determining
the fair value of the share-based payments on the date of grant using an option-pricing model with assumptions regarding a number
of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the risk-free interest rate of the
awards, the expected life of the awards, the expected volatility over the term of the awards, the expected dividends of the awards,
and an estimate of the amount of awards that are expected to be forfeited. If assumptions change in the application of ASC Topic
718 and its fair value recognition provisions in future periods, the stock-based compensation cost ultimately recorded under the
guidelines of ASC Topic 718 may differ significantly from what was recorded in the current period.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements:    

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), requiring an entity to recognize the
amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated
standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of
either a full retrospective or retrospective with cumulative effect transition method. The updated standard becomes effective
for the Company on January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and we are
currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740), simplifying the presentation of deferred taxes on the balance
sheet by requiring companies to classify everything as either a non-current asset or non-current liability. Early adoption of
this ASU is permitted. ClearOne has adopted this standard update early as it simplified the presentation of taxes on the balance
sheet and within the income tax footnote.  

In
February 2016, FASB released Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to bring transparency to lessee balance
sheets. The ASU will require organizations that lease assets (lessees) to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet
for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than 12 months. The standard will apply to both types
of leases-capital (or finance) leases and operating leases. Previously, GAAP has required only capital leases to be recognized
on lessee balance sheets. The standard will take effect the Company for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early application will be permitted for all organizations. The Company has not yet selected
a transition method and we are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on the consolidated financial
statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Shared-Based Payment Accounting.
The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements, including the income
tax impact, classification on the statement of cash flows and forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company on January
1, 2017 and we are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which requires
measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company beginning
January 1, 2020 and we are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which addresses eight specific
cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company beginning
January 1, 2018 and we are currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-15 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

An

our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures

2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS   

In
May 2012, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $2 million
of our outstanding common stock. On July 30, 2012, the Board of Directors increased the repurchase amount to $3 million from the
original $2 million. On February 20, 2013, the Board of Directors again increased the repurchase amount to $10 million from $3
million. On December 2, 2014, ClearOne, Inc. issued a press release announcing the declaration of future cash dividends by the
Company s Board of Directors and reported the discontinuance of this stock repurchase program. At the time of the discontinuance
of this stock repurchase program, the Company had repurchased approximately $5.4 million of the Company s stock.  

On
March 9, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $10 million of the Company s outstanding
shares of common stock under a new stock repurchase program. In connection with the repurchase authorization, the Company was
authorized to complete the repurchase through open market transactions or through an accelerated share repurchase program, in
each case to be executed at management s discretion based on business and market conditions, stock price, trading restrictions,
acquisition activity and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.
The transactions effectuated to date occurred in open market purchases.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 we acquired the following shares of common stock under the current stock repurchase
program:  

From
March 11, 2016 to March 17, 2016, the Company offered to repurchase eligible vested options to purchase shares under the 1998
Plan and the 2007 Plan from employees. The Company repurchased delivered options at a repurchase price equal to the difference
between the closing market price on the date of the employee s communication of accepting the repurchase offer and the exercise
price of such employee s delivered options, subject to applicable withholding taxes and charges. The Company repurchased
225,542 stock options from employees at an average purchase price of $7.77
