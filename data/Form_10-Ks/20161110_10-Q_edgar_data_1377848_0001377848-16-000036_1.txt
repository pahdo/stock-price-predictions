  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(1) Organization 
  ICON Leasing Fund Twelve, LLC (the  LLC ) was formed on   October 3, 2006   as a Delaware limited liability company. When used in these notes to consolidated financial statements, the terms  we,   us,   our  or similar terms refer to the LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
  We operated as an equipment leasing and finance program in which the capital our members invested was pooled together to make investments, pay fees and establish a small reserve.  We primarily acquired equipment subject to lease, purchased equipment and leased it to third-party end users or financed equipment for third parties and, to a lesser degree, acquired ownership rights to items of leased equipment at lease expiration. 
  Our manager is ICON Capital, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the  Manager ).  Our Manager manages and controls our business affairs, including, but not limited to, our equipment leases and other financing transactions, pursuant to the terms of our limited liability company agreement (the  LLC Agreement ). 
  Our operating period ended on April 30, 2014. On May 1, 2014, we commenced our liquidation period, during which we have sold and will continue to sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business. 
   
  (2) Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
  Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. In the opinion of our Manager, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative o  f the results for the full year.  
  Restricted Cash 
  Cash that is restricted from use in operations is generally classified as restricted cash. Classification of changes in restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows depends on the predominant source of the related cash flows. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the predominant cash generated from restricted cash was related to rental income receipts associated with our leasing operations. The use of this cash was restricted pursuant to a provision in the non-recourse long-term debt agreement. Restricted cash is presented within other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. As a result, these changes in restricted cash were classified within net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  Credit Quality of Notes Receivable and Finance Leases and Credit Loss Reserve 
  Our Manager monitors the ongoing credit quality of our financing receivables by (i) reviewing and analyzing a borrower s financial performance on a regular basis, including review of financial statements received on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis as prescribed in the loan or lease agreement, (ii) tracking the relevant credit metrics of each financing receivable and a borrower s compliance with financial and non-financial covenants, (iii) monitoring a borrower s payment history and public credit rating, if available, and (iv) assessing our exposure based on the current investment mix. As part of the monitoring process, our Manager may physically inspect the collateral or a borrower s facility and meet with a borrower s management to better understand such borrower s financial performance and its future plans on an as-needed basis.  
  As our financing receivables, generally notes receivable and finance leases, are limited in number, our Manager is able to estimate the credit loss reserve based on a detailed analysis of each financing receivable as opposed to using portfolio-based metrics. Our Manager does not use a system of assigning internal risk ratings to each of our financing receivables. Rather, each financing receivable is analyzed quarterly and categorized as either performing or non-performing based on certain factors including, but not limited to, financial results, satisfying scheduled payments and compliance with financial covenants. A financing receivable is usually categorized as non-performing only when a borrower experiences financial difficulties and has failed to make scheduled payments. Our Manager then analyzes whether the financing receivable should be placed on a non-accrual status, a credit loss reserve should be established or the financing receivable should be restructured. As part of the assessment, updated collateral value is usually considered and such collateral value can be based on a third party industry expert appraisal or, depending on the type of collateral and accessibility to relevant published guides or market sales data, internally derived fair value. Material events would be specifically disclosed in the discussion of each financing receivable held.

Financing receivables are generally placed on a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, our Manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days   and based upon our Manager s judgment, these accounts may be placed on a non-accrual status.   
  In accordance with the cost recovery method, payments received on non-accrual financing receivables are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal of non-accrual financing receivables is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. Financing receivables on non-accrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent payments have been received, and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable. 
  When our Manager deems it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractual principal and interest on a non-performing financing receivable, we perform an analysis to determine if a credit loss reserve is necessary. This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the financing receivable, and/or the collateral value of the asset underlying the financing receivable when financing receivable repayment is collateral dependent. If it is determined that the impaired value of the non-performing financing receivable is less than the net carrying value, we will recognize a credit loss reserve or adjust the existing credit loss reserve with a corresponding charge to earnings.  We then charge off a financing receivable in the period that it is deemed uncollectible by reducing the credit loss reserve and the balance of the financing receivable.  
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-01,   Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items   ( ASU 2015-01 ), which simplifies income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items.  We adopted ASU 2015-01 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.    
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU 2015-02 ), which modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, and affects the consolidation analysis by reducing the frequency of application of related party guidance and excluding certain fees in the primary beneficiary determination. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements.  
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest   Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of such debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03 as of March 31, 2016. Consequently, we reclassified   $610,405   of debt issuance costs from other non-current assets to non-recourse long-term debt, less current portion on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015, which resulted in the following adjustments: 

Other Recent Accounting Pronouncement  s 
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), requiring revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for goods and services. This new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Deferral of the Effective Date   ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Under such deferral, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, but not before our original effective date of January 1, 2017. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ), which provides guidance about

management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 becomes effective for us on our fiscal year ending after December 31, 2016, and all subsequent annual and interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments   Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ), which provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 implements changes to lessor accounting focused on conforming with certain changes made to lessee accounting and the recently released revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   ( ASU 2016-07 ), which eliminates the retroactive adjustments to an investment upon it qualifying for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence by the investor. ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for equity method accounting. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.    
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which modifies the measurement of credit losses by eliminating the probable initial recognition threshold set forth in current guidance, and instead reflects an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-13 through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The adoption of ASU 2016-15 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-15 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements. 

(3)  Net Investment in Notes Receivable 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no net investment in notes receivable on non-accrual status. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our net investment in note receivable and accrued interest related to   four   affiliates of T cnicas Maritimas Avanzadas, S.A. de C.V. (collectively,  TMA ) totaled   $21,002,939   and   $5,013,933  , respectively, of which an aggregate of   $6,940,740   was over 90 days past due. As of   December 31, 2015  , our net investment in note receivable and accrued interest related to TMA totaled   $21,002,939   and   $2,767,269  , respectively, of which an aggregate of   $3,137,479   was over 90 days past due. TMA is in technical default due to its failure to cause all   four   platform supply vessels to be under   contract by March 31, 2015 and in payment default while available cash has been swept by the senior lender and applied to the senior tranche of the facility (the  Senior Loan ) in accordance with the secured term loan credit facility agreement. Interest on our tranche of the facility (the  ICON Loan ) is currently being capitalized. While our note receivable has not been paid in accordance with

the secured term loan credit facility agreement, our collateral position has been strengthened as the principal balance of the Senior Loan was paid down at a faster rate. Based on, among other things, TMA s payment history and estimated collateral value as of   September 30, 2016  , our Manager continues to believe that all contractual interest and outstanding principal payments under the ICON Loan are collectible. As a result, we continue to account for our net investment in note receivable related to TMA on an accrual basis despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due. In January 2016, the remaining   two   previously unchartered vessels had commenced employment. As a result, our Manager is currently engaged in discussions with the senior lender and TMA to amend the facility. 
  As of September 30, 2016, our net investment in note receivable and accrued interest related to Lubricating Specialties Company ( LSC ) totaled   $2,643,060   and   $207,287  , respectively, of which an aggregate of   $101,086   was over 90 days past due. As of December 31, 2015, our net investment in note receivable and accrued interest related to LSC totaled   $2,668,887   and   $89,010  , respectively, of which   no   amount was past due.  Our Manager engaged in discussions with LSC management during which it was advised that the liquidity constraints being experienced by LSC is temporary.  In addition, LSC management acknowledged its outstanding debt obligations under the loan and the commencement of default interest accruing on such outstanding debt pursuant to the loan agreement. Based on, among other things, the value of the collateral, our Manager continues to believe that all contractual interest and outstanding principal payments are collectible. As a result, we continue to account for our net investment in note receivable related to LSC on an accrual basis despite a portion of the outstanding balance being over 90 days past due. 
    
  Net investment in notes receivable consisted of the following: 

There was   no   allowance for credit loss as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . There were no related activities during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  There was   no   allowance for credit loss as of   September 30, 2015   and no related activities during the three months ended     September 30, 2015  .   
    
  Credit loss allowance activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   were as follows: 

On August 9, 2016, Premier Trailer Leasing, Inc. ( Premier Trailer ) satisfied its obligations in connection with a secured term loan scheduled to mature on September 24, 2020 by making a prepayment of   $10,327,777  , comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $  200,000  . The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income. 

(4) Net Investment in Finance Leases 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had no net investment in finance leases on non-accrual status and no net investment in finance leases that was past due 90 days or more and still accruing. 
  Net investment in finance leases consisted of the following:

  On January 14, 2016, D T Holdings, LLC ( D T ) satisfied its remaining lease obligations by making a prepayment of   $8,000,000  . In addition, D T exercised its option to repurchase all assets under the lease for   $1  , upon which title was transferred. As a result of the prepayment, we recognized finance income of approximately   $1,400,000  . 

(5) Leased Equipment at Cost  
  Leased equipment at cost consisted of the following: 

Depreciation expense was   $1,063,132   and   $4,625,631   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Depreciation expense was   $1,751,842   and   $5,256,667   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.   
  On March 24, 2009, we and Swiber Engineering Ltd. ( Swiber ) entered into a joint venture owned   51%   by us and   49%   by Swiber for the purpose of purchasing a 300-man accommodation and work barge, the Swiber Chateau (f/k/a the Swiber Victorious). Simultaneously with the purchase, the barge was chartered to Swiber Offshore Marine Pte. Ltd., an affiliate of Swiber ( Swiber Offshore ), for   96   months. The Swiber Chateau was purchased for   $42,500,000  , which was funded by (i) a   $19,125,000   equity investment from us, (ii) an   $18,375,000   contribution-in-kind by Swiber and (iii) a   $5,000,000   subordinated, non-recourse and unsecured payable from Swiber. The payable bears interest at   3.5%   per year and is recorded within seller s credits on our consolidated balance sheets.  If a default occurs under the charter, the joint venture will not be required to pay to Swiber principal and interest outstanding under the payable.  Swiber Holdings Ltd. ( Swiber Holdings ), the parent company of Swiber and Swiber Offshore (together with Swiber and Swiber Offshore, the  Swiber Group ), guarantees the payment and performance obligations of Swiber Offshore and its affiliates under all transaction documents.  
  During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we obtained a third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the vessel as of June 27, 2016 was   $17,875,000  , which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we performed an impairment test on the vessel. Based on such test, we recorded an impairment loss of   $5,218,643   during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Pursuant to the joint venture s operating agreement, in the event that, among other things, (i) there is a default by Swiber Offshore under the charter, or (ii) the fair market value of the vessel is less than   $21,000,000  , all of Swiber s interests in the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds resulting from the joint venture will be subordinate to our rights in such distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds until such time that we have received in distribution the return of the full amount of our contribution to the joint venture and a return at a monthly compounded rate equal to   15.51%   per year.  As the then current fair market value of the vessel was less than   $21,000,000  , our Manager concluded that, commencing June 27, 2016, Swiber s rights to the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds are subordinated and Swiber should incur first loss resulting from the joint venture until we achieve our return described above. Accordingly, the impairment loss   recorded

as of June 30, 2016 of   $5,218,643   was allocated entirely to Swiber, the non-controlling interest holder. As a result, the impairment had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the six months ended June   30, 2016  . Swiber Offshore has also failed to make its monthly charter payments to the joint venture since July 2016.    
  On July 27, 2016, Swiber Holdings filed a petition in Singapore to wind up and liquidate the company. On July 29, 2016, Swiber Holdings withdrew its petition for winding up and liquidation and submitted an application for court-supervised judicial management. We are currently in the process of evaluating our rights and remedies under all relevant Singapore judicial management and insolvency laws.  
  In November 2016, we obtained an updated third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the vessel decreased to   $14,770,000  , which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we recorded an additional impairment loss of   $3,105,000   during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which was allocated entirely to Swiber. T  he impairment loss had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

(6) Vessels/Assets Held for Sale 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , our total investment in vessels was   $5,720,000  .   As of June 30, 2016, the Cebu Trader (f/k/a the Arabian Express) and the Aegean Express met the criteria to be classified as assets held for sale resulting in a reclassification from vessels to assets held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets. No further depreciation was recorded on the vessels upon such reclassification. In September 2016, the Cebu Trader and the Aegean Express were sold to unaffiliated third parties for   $3,200,000   and   $3,000,000  , respectively. As a result, we recorded an aggregate gain on sale of   $303,943   during the three months ended September 30, 2016.   Depreciation expense was   $0   and   $177,387   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Depreciation expense was   $428,849   and   $1,286,548   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , pre-tax loss associated with the vessels was   $155,631   and   $167,052  , respectively. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , pre-tax loss associated with the vessels was   $10,649,053   and   $10,965,220  , respectively. 

(7) Investment in Joint Ventures 
  On December 22, 2011, ICON Mauritius MI, LLC ( ICON Mauritius MI ), a joint venture owned   25%   by us and   75%   by ICON Equipment and Corporate Infrastructure Fund Fourteen, L.P. ( Fund Fourteen ), an entity also managed by our Manager, made a   $20,124,000   subordinated term loan to Jurong Aromatics Corporation Pte. Ltd. ( JAC ) as part of a   $171,050,000   term loan facility. The loan initially bore interest at rates ranging between   12.5%   and   15%   per year and matures in January 2021. As a result of JAC s failure to make an expected payment that was due to the joint venture during the three months ended March 31, 2015, the interest rate payable by JAC under the loan increased from   12.5%   to   15.5%  . The loan is secured by a second priority security interest in all of JAC s assets, which include, among other things, all equipment, plant and machinery associated with a condensate splitter and aromatics complex. 
  On May 15, 2013, ICON Mauritius MI II, LLC ( ICON Mauritius MI II ), a joint venture owned   21%   by us,   39%   by ICON Leasing Fund Eleven, LLC ( Fund Eleven ) and   40%   by ICON ECI Fund Fifteen, L.P., each an entity also managed by our Manager, purchased a portion of a   $208,038,290   subordinated credit facility for JAC from Standard Chartered Bank for   $28,462,500  . The subordinated credit facility initially bore interest at rates ranging between   12.5%   and   15%   per year and matures in January 2021. As a result of JAC s failure to make an expected payment that was due to the joint venture during the three months ended March 31, 2015, the interest rate payable by JAC under the facility increased from   12.5%   to   15.5%  . The subordinated credit facility is secured by a second priority security interest in all of JAC s assets, which include, among other things, all equipment, plant and machinery associated with a condensate splitter and aromatics complex. Our initial contribution to the joint venture was   $6,456,034  .  
  During 2015, JAC experienced liquidity constraints as a result of a general economic slow-down in China and India, which led to lower demand from such countries, as well as the price decline of energy and other commodities. As a result, JAC s manufacturing facility ceased operations and JAC was not able to service interest payments under the loan and facility. In addition, an expected tolling arrangement with JAC s suppliers that would have allowed JAC s manufacturing facility to resume operations did not commence in 2015 as originally anticipated. Discussions among the senior lenders and certain other stakeholders of JAC regarding a restructuring plan ended as the senior lenders did not agree to amendments to their credit facilities as part of the broader restructuring that was being contemplated. As a result, JAC entered receivership on September 28, 2015.

As a result of these factors, during the three months ended June 30, 2015, our Manager determined that there was doubt regarding the joint ventures  ultimate collectability of the loan and facility and commenced recording credit losses. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the joint ventures recorded a total credit loss of   $33,264,710  , of which our share was   $7,834,118  . Commencing with the three months ended June 30, 2015 and on a quarterly basis thereafter, our Manager had reassessed the collectability of the loan and facility by considering the following factors, among others (i) what a potential buyer may be willing to pay to acquire JAC based on a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples and (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries. During the year ended   December 31, 2015  , the joint ventures recorded an aggregate credit loss of   $60,258,883   related to JAC based on our Manager s quarterly collectability analyses, of which our share was   $14,010,881  . Our Manager also assessed impairment under the equity method of accounting for our investment in the joint ventures and concluded that there was no impairment. 
  In January 2016, our Manager engaged in further discussions with JAC s other subordinated lenders and the Receiver regarding a near term plan for JAC s manufacturing facility. Based upon such discussions, our Manager anticipated that a   one  -year tolling arrangement with JAC s suppliers would be implemented to allow JAC s facility to recommence operations. In July 2016, the tolling arrangement was finally implemented and the manufacturing facility resumed operations. Although our Manager believes that the marketability of JAC s facility should improve now that it has recommenced operations, our Manager does not anticipate that JAC will make any payments to the joint ventures while operating under the tolling arrangement. As part of the tolling arrangement and the receivership process, JAC incurred additional senior debt, which could be up to   $55,000,000  , to fund its operations as well as any receivership-related costs. As a result, our Manager determined that the joint ventures  ultimate collectability of the loan and facility was further in doubt. As of June 30, 2016, our Manager updated its quarterly assessment by considering (i) a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples; (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries and (iii) the additional senior debt incurred by JAC, which has priority over the joint ventures  loan and facility. Based upon this reassessment, our Manager determined that the joint ventures should fully reserve the outstanding balance of the loan and facility due from JAC as of June 30, 2016. As a result, the joint ventures recorded an additional total credit loss of   $10,137,863   for the three months ended June 30, 2016, of which our share was   $2,319,835  .    Our Manager continues to closely monitor the operations of JAC and the receivership process through regular communications with certain other stakeholders.   The joint ventures did not recognize finance income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the joint ventures recognized finance income of   $0   and   $2,314,051  , respectively, prior to the loan and facility being considered impaired. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total net investment in notes receivable held by the joint ventures was   $0   and   $10,137,863  , respectively, and our total investment in the joint ventures was   $0   and   $2,324,885  , respectively.  
  Information as to the results of operations of ICON Mauritius MI is summarized as follows:   

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our investment in ICON Mauritius MI was   $0   and   $1,194,918  , respectively. 
  Information as to the results of operations of ICON Mauritius MI II is summarized as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our investment in ICON Mauritius MI II was   $0   and   $1,129,967  , respectively.

On June 8, 2016, an unaffiliated third party purchased   100%   of the limited liability company interests of ICON AET Holdings, LLC ( ICON AET ), a joint venture owned   25%   by us and   75%   by Fund Fourteen, for net sales proceeds of   $48,798,058  .  As a result, we recorded a gain on sale of investment joint venture of   $2,012,669  . 
  Information as to the results of operations of ICON AET is summarized as follows: 

(8) Non-Recourse Long-Term Debt  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had the following non-recourse long-term debt: 

All of our non-recourse long-term debt obligations consist of notes payable in which the lender has a security interest in the underlying assets. If the borrower were to default on the underlying lease, resulting in our default on the non-recourse long-term debt, the assets could be foreclosed upon and the proceeds would be remitted to the lender in extinguishment of that debt. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total carrying value of assets subject to non-recourse long-term debt was   $81,896,820   and   $87,131,546  , respectively. 
     On October 20, 2016, we were notified of an event of default on the senior debt associated with   two   tanker vessels currently on charter to an affiliate of Siva Global Ships Limited ( Siva ) as a result of a change of control of the bareboat charter guarantor, also an affiliate of Siva. The lender has reserved, but not exercised, its rights under the loan agreement. As a result of such default, we classified the entire outstanding balance of the debt of   $19,015,000   to current liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  . 

(9) Transactions with Related Parties    
  We paid distributions to our Manager of   $131,976   and   $52,627   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. We paid distributions to our Manager of   $232,986   and   $229,646   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Additionally, our Manager s interest in the net income (loss) attributable to us was   $10,808   and   $(123,094)   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Our Manager s interest in the net income (loss) attributable to us was   $28,115   and   $(206,006)   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Fees and other expenses incurred by us to our Manager or its affiliates were as follows:

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had a net payable due to our Manager and affiliates of   $10,378   and   $437,925  , respectively, primarily related to administrative expense reimbursements.  
  In June 2016, we sold our interests in a certain joint venture to an unaffiliated third party. In connection with the sale, the third party required that an affiliate of our Manager provides bookkeeping and administrative services related to such asset for a fee. 

(10) Fair Value Measurements 
  Assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 
             
    Level 1: Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. 
                
    Level 2: Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.    
                
    Level 3: Pricing inputs that are generally unobservable and are supported by little or no market data. 
       
  Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  We are required, on a nonrecurring basis, to adjust the carrying value or provide valuation allowances for certain assets using fair value measurements. Our non-financial assets, such as leased equipment at cost and vessels, are measured at fair value when there is an indicator of impairment and recorded at fair value only when an impairment charge is recognized. To determine the fair value when impairment indicators exist, we utilize different valuation approaches based on transaction-specific facts and circumstances to determine fair value, including, but not limited to, discounted cash flow models and the use of comparable transactions. 
  The following table summarizes the valuation of our material non-financial assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, which is presented as of the date the impairment was recorded, while the carrying value of the asset is presented as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) There were nonrecurring fair value measurements in relation to the impairment loss as of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 related to the Swiber Chateau. As of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the fair value was   $17,875,000   and   $14,770,000  , respectively. 
    
  During the three months ended June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016  , we identified impairment indicators and measured our leased equipment at cost related to the Swiber Chateau for impairment purposes. The estimated fair value of such leased equipment at cost at June 30, 2016 was based on an independent third-party valuation using a combination of the cost and sales comparison approach. The estimated fair value of such leased equipment at cost at September 30, 2016 was based on an updated independent third-party valuation using a cost approach. The estimated fair values related to the Swiber Chateau were based on inputs that are generally unobservable and are supported by little or no market data and were classified within Level 3.

Assets and Liabilities for which Fair Value is Disclosed 
  Certain of our financial assets and liabilities, which include fixed-rate notes receivable, fixed-rate non-recourse long-term debt and seller s credits, for which fair value is required to be disclosed, were valued using inputs that are generally unobservable and are supported by little or no market data and are therefore classified within Level 3. Under U.S. GAAP, we use projected cash flows for fair value measurements of these financial assets and liabilities. Fair value information with respect to certain of our other assets and liabilities is not separately provided since (i) U.S. GAAP does not require fair value disclosures of lease arrangements and (ii) the carrying value of financial assets and liabilities, other than lease-related investments, approximates fair value due to their short-term maturities. 
  The estimated fair value of our fixed-rate notes receivable was based on the discounted value of future cash flows related to the loans at inception, adjusted for changes in certain variables, including, but not limited to, credit quality, industry, financial markets and other recent comparables. The estimated fair value of our fixed-rate non-recourse long-term debt and seller s credits was based on the discounted value of future cash flows related to the debt and seller s credits based on a discount rate derived from the margin at inception, adjusted for material changes in risk, plus the applicable fixed rate based on the current interest rate curve. The fair value of the principal outstanding on our fixed-rate notes receivable was derived using discount rates ranging between   17.73%   and   25.00%   as of   September 30, 2016  . The fair value of the principal outstanding on our fixed-rate non-recourse long-term debt and seller s credits was derived using discount rates ranging between   1.37%   and   6.72%   as of   September 30, 2016  . 

(11) Commitments and Contingencies  
  At the time we acquire or divest of our interest in an equipment lease or other financing transaction, we may, under very limited circumstances, agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Our Manager believes that any liability of ours that may arise as a result of any such indemnification obligations may or may not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole.  
  In connection with certain debt obligations, we are required to maintain restricted cash accounts with certain banks. At   September 30, 2016  , we had restricted cash of   $3,078,161  , which is presented within other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
  During 2008, ICON EAR, LLC ( ICON EAR ), a joint venture owned   55%   by us and   45%   by Fund Eleven, purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to Equipment Acquisition Resources, Inc. ( EAR ) for   $15,729,500  . On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against ICON EAR seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleged were fraudulently transferred from EAR to ICON EAR. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to ICON EAR during the   90  -day period preceding EAR s bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that ICON EAR received as security in connection with its investment. Our Manager filed an answer to the complaint that included certain affirmative defenses. Since that time, substantial discovery was completed. Given the risks, costs and uncertainty surrounding litigation in bankruptcy, our Manager engaged in mediation with the trustee to resolve this matter, which resulted in a tentative settlement in May 2016 subject to bankruptcy court approval. On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement. The   settlement released all claims against ICON EAR, Fund Eleven and us for an aggregate settlement payment of   $3,100,000  . As a result, we recorded our proportionate share of the litigation settlement expense of   $1,209,000   during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The settlement amount was paid on July 15, 2016.

  Overview    
  We operated as an equipment leasing and finance program in which the capital our members invested was pooled together to make investments, pay fees and establish a small reserve. We primarily acquired equipment subject to lease, purchased equipment and leased it to third-party end users or financed equipment for third parties and, to a lesser degree, acquired ownership rights to items of leased equipment at lease expiration.  Some of our equipment leases were acquired for cash and were expected to provide current cash flow, which we refer to as  income  leases.  For our other equipment leases, we financed the majority of the purchase price through borrowings from third parties.  We refer to these leases as  growth  leases.  These growth leases generated little or no current cash flow because substantially all of the rental payments we received from the lessee were used to service the indebtedness associated with acquiring or financing the lease.  For these leases, we anticipated that the future value of the leased equipment would exceed our cash portion of the purchase price.    
  Our Manager manages and controls our business affairs, including, but not limited to, our equipment leases and other financing transactions, under the terms of our LLC Agreement. 
  Our offering period ended on April 30, 2009 and our operating period commenced on May 1, 2009. During our offering period, we raised total equity of $347,686,947. Our operating period ended on April 30, 2014 and our liquidation period commenced on May 1, 2014. During our liquidation period, we have sold and will continue to sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business. 
   
  Recent Significant Transactions 
  We engaged in the following significant transactions since   December 31, 2015  : 
  Trucks and Trailers 
  On January 14, 2016, D T satisfied its remaining lease obligations by making a prepayment of   $8,000,000  . In addition, D T exercised its option to repurchase all assets under the lease for   $1  , upon which title was transferred. As a result of the prepayment, we recognized finance income of approximately   $1,400,000  . 
  Marine Vessels 
  On March 24, 2009, we and Swiber entered into a joint venture owned   51%   by us and   49%   by Swiber for the purpose of purchasing the Swiber Chateau. During the three months ended June 30, 2016, we obtained a third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the vessel as of June 27, 2016 was $17,875,000, which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we performed an impairment test on the vessel. Based on such test, we recorded an impairment loss of $5,218,643 during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Pursuant to the joint venture s operating agreement, in the event that, among other things, (i) there is a default by Swiber Offshore under the charter, or (ii) the fair market value of the vessel is less than   $21,000,000  , all of Swiber s interests in the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds resulting from the joint venture will be subordinate to our rights in such distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds until such time that we have received  
  in distribution the return of the full amount of our contribution to the joint venture and a return at a monthly compounded rate equal to 15.51% per year.  As the then current fair market value of the vessel was less than   $21,000,000  , our Manager concluded that, commencing June 27, 2016, Swiber s rights to the distributions, net cash flow, net profits and net proceeds are subordinated and Swiber should incur first loss resulting from the joint venture until we achieve our return described above. Accordingly, the impairment loss recorded as of June 30, 2016 of $  5,218,643   was allocated entirely to Swiber, the non-controlling interest holder. As a result, the impairment had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Swiber Offshore has also failed to make its monthly charter payments to the joint venture since July 2016. 
  On July 27, 2016, Swiber Holdings filed a petition in Singapore to wind up and liquidate the company. On July 29, 2016, Swiber Holdings withdrew its petition for winding up and liquidation and submitted an application for court-supervised judicial management. We are currently in the process of evaluating our rights and remedies under all relevant Singapore judicial management and insolvency laws.  
  In November 2016, we obtained an updated third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the vessel decreased to $14,770,000, which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we recorded an additional impairment loss of $3,105,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which was allocated entirely to Swiber. The impairment loss had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  On June 8, 2016, an unaffiliated third party purchased   100%   of the limited liability company interests of ICON AET, a joint venture owned   25%   by us, for net sales proceeds of   $48,798,058  . As a result, we recorded a gain on sale of investment in joint venture of $  2,012,669  . 
  Vessels 
  In September 2016, the Cebu Trader and the Aegean Express were sold to unaffiliated third parties for $3,200,000 and $3,000,000, respectively. As a result, we recorded an aggregate gain on sale of   $303,943   during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Notes Receivable 
  In connection with our investment in joint ventures related to JAC, in January 2016, our Manager engaged in further discussions with JAC s other subordinated lenders and the Receiver regarding a near term plan for JAC s manufacturing facility. Based upon such discussions, our Manager anticipated that a one-year tolling arrangement with JAC s suppliers would be implemented to allow JAC s facility to recommence operations. In July 2016, the tolling arrangement was finally implemented and the manufacturing facility resumed operations. Although our Manager believes that the marketability of JAC s facility should improve now that it has recommenced operations, our Manager does not anticipate that JAC will make any payments to the joint ventures while operating under the tolling arrangement. As part of the tolling arrangement and the receivership process, JAC incurred additional senior debt, which could be up to   $55,000,000  , to fund its operations as well as any receivership-related costs. As a result, our Manager determined that the joint ventures  ultimate collectability of the loan and facility was further in doubt. As of June 30, 2016, our Manager updated its quarterly assessment by considering (i) a comparable enterprise value derived from EBITDA multiples; (ii) the average trading price of unsecured distressed debt in comparable industries and (iii) the additional senior debt incurred by JAC, which has priority over the joint ventures  loan and facility. Based upon this reassessment, our Manager determined that the joint ventures should fully reserve the outstanding balance of the loan and facility due from JAC as of June 30, 2016. As a result, the joint ventures recorded an additional total credit loss of   $10,137,863   for the three months ended June 30, 2016, of which our share was   $2,319,835  .    Our Manager continues to closely monitor the operations of JAC and the receivership process through regular communications with certain other stakeholders.   The joint ventures did not recognize finance income for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the joint ventures recognized finance income of   $0   and   $2,314,051  , respectively, prior to the loan and facility being considered impaired. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total net investment in notes receivable held by the joint ventures was   $0   and   $10,137,863  , respectively, and our total investment in the joint ventures was   $0   and   $2,324,885  , respectively.  
  On August 9, 2016, Premier Trailer satisfied its obligations in connection with a secured term loan scheduled to mature on September 24, 2020 by making a prepayment of   $10,327,777  , comprised of all outstanding principal, accrued interest and a prepayment fee of $  200,000  . The prepayment fee was recognized as additional finance income.

Impaired Leased Asset within Operating Lease Transactions 
  In November 2016, we obtained an updated third-party appraisal indicating that the fair market value of the Swiber Chateau was $14,770,000, which was below the net carrying value. As a result, we recorded an additional impairment loss of $3,105,000 during the 2016 Quarter, which was allocated entirely to Swiber. The impairment loss had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the 2016 Quarter. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the net carrying value of the vessel was $14,770,000 and $24,528,856, respectively. During the   2016   Quarter and the   2015   Quarter  , we recognized rental income of $0 and $1,826,250, respectively (see  Recent Significant Transactions  above).  
  Revenue and other income for the   2016   Quarter   and the   2015   Quarter   is summariz  ed as follows: 

Total revenue and other income for the   2016   Quarter   increased   $837,513  , or   18.1%  , as compared to the   2015   Quarter  . The increase was primarily due to a decrease in loss from investment in joint ventures due to no credit loss recorded during the   2016   Quarter   as compared to the credit loss recorded during the   2015   Quarter by our joint ventures related to JAC   and a gain on sale of vessels as a result of the sa  le of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during the   2016   Quarter  . The increase was partially offset by decreases in (i) rental income due to no income recognition related to Swiber Offshore as collectability of monthly charter payments has been in doubt since July 2016, (ii) finance income primarily due to several prepayments by our borrowers and lessees during or subsequent to the   2015   Quarter   and (iii) time charter revenue due to lower charter rates during the   2016   Quarter   as compared to the   2015   Quarter  . 
  Expenses for the   2016   Quarter   and the   2015   Quarter   are summarized as follows: 

Total expenses for the   2016   Quarter   decreased   $8,734,648  , or   54.8%  , as compared to the   2015   Quarter  . The decrease was primarily due to the impairment loss related to the Swiber Chateau that was allocated entirely to Swiber during the 2016 Quarter

as compared to the impairment loss recorded during the 2015 Quarter related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader, which also resulted in a decrease in depreciation due to a lower depreciable base.  
  Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests changed by   $3,818,027  , from net income of   $996,098   in the   2015   Quarter   to a net loss of   $2,821,929   in the   2016   Quarter  . The change was primarily due to no income being recognized related to Swiber during the 2016 Quarter. 
  Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Fund Twelve 
  As a result of the foregoing factors, net income (loss) attributable to us for the   2016   Quarter   and the   2015   Quarter   was   $1,080,789   and   $(12,309,399)  , respectively. Net income (loss) attributable to us per weighted average additional share of limited liability compan  y interests ( Share ) outstanding for the   2016   Quarter   and the   2015   Quarter   was   $3.07   and   $(34.98)  , respectively. 

Results of Operations for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   (the    2016   Period ) and   2015   (the    2015   Period ) 
  The following percentages are only as of a stated period and are not expected to be comparable in future periods.  Further, these percentages are only representative of the percentage of finance income or rental income as of each stated period, and as such are not indicative of the concentration of any asset type or customer by the amount of equity invested or our investment portfolio as a whole. 
  Financing Transactions  
  During the   2016   Period   and the   2015   Period  , certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total finance income as follows: 

Interest income and prepayment fees from our net investment in notes receivable and finance income from our net investment in finance leases are included in finance income in our consolidated statements of operations.    
  Non-performing Assets within Financing Transactions 
  During the year ended   December 31, 2014  , VAS experienced financial hardship resulting in its failure to make the final monthly payment under the secured term loan as well as the balloon payment due on the October 6, 2014 maturity date. Accordingly, the loan was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss was recorded. In March 2015, the 90-day standstill period provided for in the VAS loan agreement ended without a viable restructuring or refinancing plan agreed upon. In addition, the senior lender continued to charge VAS forbearance fees. Although discussions among the parties were still ongoing, these factors resulted in our Manager making a determination to record an additional credit loss reserve of $362,665 during the three months ended March 31, 2015 to reflect a potential forced liquidation of the collateral. The forced liquidation value of the collateral was primarily based on a third-party appraisal using a sales comparison approach. On July 23, 2015, we sold all of our interest in the loan to GB for $268,975. As a result, we recorded an additional credit loss of $334,719 and wrote off the credit loss reserve and corresponding balance of the loan of   $1,329,370   during the   2015   Period  . No finance income was recognized since the date the loan was considered impaired during the three months ended   December 31, 2014  . Accordingly, no finance income was recognized for the   2015   Period  . 
  On May 12, 2015, Patriot Coal commenced a voluntary Chapter 11 proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. On July 24, 2015, Patriot Coal notified us that it was terminating the lease prior to its August 1, 2015 expiration date and that it would not be making the balloon payment of $4,866,000 due at the end of the lease term. After extensive negotiations, we agreed with Patriot Coal to extend the term of the lease by one month and to reduce the balloon payment to $700,000, subject to the bankruptcy court s approval. As a result, the finance lease was placed on non-accrual status and a credit loss of $4,151,594 was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2015.  After obtaining the bankruptcy

court s approval, our bankruptcy claim against Patriot Coal was strengthened from an unsecured to an administrative claim. In August 2015, title to the leased equipment was transferred to Patriot Coal upon our receipt of the additional lease payment and the reduced balloon payment.   No gain or loss was recognized during the 2015 Period as a result of the sale of leased equipment.   For the   2015   Period  , we recognized finance income of $159,694. 
  Operating Lease Transactions  
  During the   2016   Period   and the   2015   Period  , certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total rental income as follows: 

Impaired Leased Assets within Operating Lease Transactions 
  During   2016  , we obtained third-party appraisals and estimated the fair market values of the Swiber Chateau as of June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016 to be   $17,875,000   and $14,770,000, respectively, which were below the net carrying values. As a result, we recorded an aggregate impairment loss of $8,323,643 during the   2016   Period  , which was allocated entirely to Swiber. The impairment loss had no impact on the net income attributable to us for the   2016   Period  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the net carrying value of the vessel was $14,770,000 and $24,528,856, respectively. During the   2016   Period and the   2015   Period  , we recognized rental income of $3,652,500 and $5,478,750, respectively (see  Recent Significant Transactions  above). 
  During the 2015 Period, we recognized an aggregate impairment loss of $10,440,129 on our vessels related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader. As of September 30, 2015, our Manager performed an impairment analysis and concluded that the carrying value of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader was not recoverable and that an impairment existed. As of December 31, 2015, the net carrying value of such vessels was $5,720,000. In September 2016, the vessels were sold to unaffiliated third parties for an aggregate purchase price of $6,200,000, which resulted in an aggregate gain on sale of   $303,943   during the 2016 Quarter.   During the 2016 Period and the 2015 Period, we recognized time charter revenue of $  2,960,443   and $4,184,849, respectively (see "Recent Significant Transactions" above).  
  Revenue and other income for the   2016   Period   and the   2015   Period   is summarized as follows: 

Total revenue and other income for the   2016   Period   increased   $5,633,477  , or   37.2%  , as compared to the   2015   Period  . The increase was primarily due to (i) a decrease in loss from investment in joint ventures due to a lower credit loss recorded by the joint ventures related to JAC during the   2016   Period   as compared to the   2015   Period, (ii)   a gain on sale of investment in joint venture as a result of the sale of our interests in ICON AET during the   2016   Period and (iii) a gain on sale of vessels as a result of the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during the 2016 Period  . The increase was partially offset by decreases in (i) finance income primarily due to several prepayments by our borrowers and lessees during the   2015   Period,   (ii)   rental income due to no income recognition related to Swiber Offshore as collectability of monthly charter payments has been in doubt since July 2016   and (iii) time charter revenue due to lower charter rates during the   2016   Period   as compared to the   2015   Period  .

Expenses for the   2016   Period   and the   2015   Period   are summarized as follows: 

Total expenses for the   2016   Period   decreased   $9,015,880  , or   27.6%  , as compared to the   2015   Period  . The decrease was primarily due to decreases in (i) the credit loss related to Patriot Coal that was recorded during the   2015   Period  , of which there was no corresponding loss recorded during the   2016   Period  , (ii) impairment loss due to the impairment loss recorded in the 2016 Period related to the Swiber Chateau that was allocated entirely to Swiber as compared to the impairment loss recorded during the 2015 Period related to the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader, (iii) depreciation on the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader after impairment losses were recorded during 2015, which resulted in a lower depreciable base and (iv) interest expense as a result of scheduled repayments on our non-recourse long-term debt, and satisfying our non-recourse long-term debt related to Cenveo Corporation ("Cenveo") resulting from its prepayment during the   2015   Period  . These decreases were partially offset by our share of the litigation settlement payment related to ICON EAR that was recorded in the   2016   Period  . 
  Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
  Net (loss) income attributable to noncontrolling interests changed by $  8,762,672  , from net income of   $3,106,286   in the   2015   Period   to a net loss of   $5,656,386   in the   2016   Period  . The change was primarily due to the allocation of the entire impairment loss related to the Swiber Chateau to Swiber during the   2016   Period  . 
  Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Fund Twelve 
  As a result of the foregoing factors, net income (loss) attributable to us for the   2016   Period   and the   2015   Period   was   $2,811,457   and   $(20,600,572)  , respectively. Net income (loss) attributable to us per weighted average additional Share outstanding for the   2016   Period   and the   2015   Period   was   $7.99   and   $(58.55)  , respectively. 

Financial Condition  
  This section discusses the major balance sheet variances at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015  . 
  Total Assets 
  Total assets decreased   $38,089,102  , from   $188,181,529   at   December 31, 2015   to   $150,092,427   at   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was primarily due to (i) the use of cash to pay distributions to our members and noncontrolling interests, (ii) the use of cash to repay our non-recourse long-term debt and (iii) the impairment loss related to the Swiber Chateau during the   2016   Period  . These decreases were partially offset by gains recognized from the sale of certain of our investments and income generated from our investments during the   2016   Period  . 
  Current Assets 
  Current assets increased   $13,306,939  , from   $22,423,057   at   December 31, 2015   to   $35,729,996   at   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily a result of proceeds received from the prepayment by Premier Trailer and from the sale of certain non-current investments during the   2016   Period  .    
  Total Liabilities 
  Total liabilities decreased   $5,167,310  , from   $62,493,259   at   December 31, 2015   to   $57,325,949   at   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of our non-recourse long-term debt and the payment of certain accrued liabilities during the   2016   Period  .

     Table of contents  

Current Liabilities 
  Current liabilities increased   $20,966,174  , from   $8,362,050   at   December 31, 2015   to   $29,328,224   at   September 30, 2016  . The increase was primarily due to the event of default on the senior debt related to Siva, which resulted in the reclassification of the outstanding balance to current liabilities, and the seller s credit that is due to Swiber in March 2017. 
  Equity 
  Equity decreased   $32,921,792  , from   $125,688,270   at   December 31, 2015   to   $92,766,478   at   September 30, 2016  . The decrease was primarily due to distributions to our members and noncontrolling interests during the   2016   Period  , partially offset by our net income during the   2016   Period  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  Summary 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had cash and cash equivalents of   $17,810,643   and   $8,404,092  , respectively. Pursuant to the terms of our offering, we established a cash reserve in the amount of 0.5% of the gross offering proceeds.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the cash reserve was $1,738,435. During our liquidation period, which commenced on May 1, 2014, we expect our main sources of cash will be from the collection of income and principal on our notes receivable and finance leases and proceeds from the sale of assets held directly by us or indirectly by our joint ventures and our main use of cash will be for distributions to our members and noncontrolling interests. Our liquidity will vary in the future, increasing to the extent cash flows from investments and proceeds from the sale of our investments exceed expenses and decreasing as we meet our debt obligations, pay distributions to our members and noncontrolling interests and to the extent that expenses exceed cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of our investments. 
  We anticipate being able to meet our liquidity requirements into the foreseeable future through the expected results of our operations, as well as cash received from our investments at maturity. However, our ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that affect us and our lessees  and borrowers  businesses that are beyond our control. 
  Cash Flows 
  Operating Activities 
  Cash provided by operating activities decreased   $614,550  , from   $16,632,965   in the   2015   Period   to   $16,018,415   in the   2016   Period  . The decrease was primarily due to less cash receipts from operations in the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period, partially offset by less cash being used to settle the amount due to our Manager during the   2016   Period   as a result of a reduction in expenses paid on our behalf by our Manager since 2014 and an increase in the collection on finance leases as a result of the prepayment by D T. 
  Investing Activities 
  Cash provided by investing activities increased   $2,801,147  , from   $25,362,399   in the   2015   Period   to   $28,163,546   in the   2016   Period  . The increase was primarily due to proceeds received from the sale of our interests in ICON AET and from the sale of the Aegean Express and the Cebu Trader during the   2016   Period  , partially offset by a decrease in principal received on notes receivable due to several prepayments during the   2015   Period  . 
  Financing Activities 
  Cash used in financing activities decreased   $3,591,228  , from   $38,366,638   in the   2015   Period   to   $34,775,410   in the   2016   Period  . The decrease was primarily due to the prepayment   on our non-recourse long-term debt associated with Cenveo during the 2015 Period as a result of the prepayment of a secured term loan by Cenveo, partially   offset by an increase in distributions to our members and noncontrolling interests during the   2016   Period   as compared to the   2015   Period  . 
  Non-Recourse Long-Term Debt 
  We had non-recourse long-term debt obligations at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   of   $42,857,167   and   $47,439,115  , respectively. All of our non-recourse long-term debt obligations consist of notes payable in which the lender has a security interest in the underlying assets. If the borrower were to default on the underlying lease, resulting in our default on the non-recourse long-term debt, the assets could be foreclosed upon and the proceeds would be remitted to the lender in extinguishment of that debt. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total carrying value of assets subject to non-recourse long-term debt was   $81,896,820   and   $87,131,546  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants related to our non-recourse long-term debt. 
  Distributions 
  
   22 

     Table of contents  

We, at our Manager s discretion, paid monthly distributions to each of our additional members beginning with the first month after each such member s admission through the end of our operating period, which was April 30, 2014. We paid distributions of   $232,986  ,   $23,065,617   and   $6,778,260   to our Manager, additional members and noncontrolling interests, respectively, during the   2016   Period  . During our liquidation period, we have paid and will continue to pay distributions in accordance with the terms our LLC Agreement. We expect that distributions paid during our liquidation period will vary, depending on the timing of the sale of our assets and/or the maturity of   our investments, and our receipt of rental, finance and other income from our investments. 

Commitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
  Commitments and Contingencies 
  At the time we acquire or divest of our interest in an equipment lease or other financing transaction, we may, under very limited circumstances, agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities. Our Manager believes that any liability of ours that may arise as a result of any such indemnification obligations may or may not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. 
  In connection with certain debt obligations, we are required to maintain restricted cash accounts with certain banks. At   September 30, 2016  , we had restricted cash of   $3,078,161  , which is presented within other non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets. 
  During 2008, ICON EAR purchased and simultaneously leased semiconductor manufacturing equipment to EAR for   $15,729,500  . On October 23, 2009, EAR filed a petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. On October 21, 2011, the Chapter 11 bankruptcy trustee for EAR filed an adversary complaint against ICON EAR seeking the recovery of the lease payments that the trustee alleged were fraudulently transferred from EAR to ICON EAR. The complaint also sought the recovery of payments made by EAR to ICON EAR during the   90  -day period preceding EAR s bankruptcy filing, alleging that those payments constituted a preference under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the complaint sought the imposition of a constructive trust over certain real property and the proceeds from the sale that ICON EAR received as security in connection with its investment. Our Manager filed an answer to the complaint that included certain affirmative defenses. Since that time, substantial discovery was completed. Given the risks, costs and uncertainty surrounding litigation in bankruptcy, our Manager engaged in mediation with the trustee to resolve this matter, which resulted in a tentative settlement in May 2016 subject to bankruptcy court approval. On July 5, 2016, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved the settlement. The settlement released all claims against ICON EAR, Fund Eleven and us for an aggregate settlement payment of   $3,100,000  . As a   result, we recorded our proportionate share of the litigation settlement expense of   $1,209,000   during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The settlement amount was paid on July 15, 2016.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    
    
  There are no material changes to the disclosures related to this item since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
  In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our Manager carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the management of our Manager, including its Co-Chief Executive Officers and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Manager s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on the foregoing evaluation, the Co-Chief Executive Officers and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that our Manager s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
  In designing and evaluating our Manager s disclosure controls and procedures, our Manager recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.  Our Manager s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Disclosure controls and procedures cannot detect or prevent all error and fraud. Some inherent limitations in disclosure controls and procedures include costs of implementation, faulty decision-making, simple error and mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all anticipated and unanticipated future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with established policies or procedures.    
  Evaluation of internal control over financial reporting 
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
