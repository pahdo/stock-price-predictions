1.     NATURE OF OPERATIONS

The Company and Nature of Business 

Pacific Ventures Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Pacific Ventures") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3, 1986, under the name AOA Corporation. On November 12, 1991, the Company changed its name to American Eagle Group, Inc. On October 22, 2012, the Company changed its name to Pacific Ventures Group, Inc.

On August 14, 2015, Pacific Ventures Group, Inc. and its stockholders entered into a share exchange agreement with Sn bar Holdings, Inc. ("Sn bar Holdings"), pursuant to which Pacific Ventures acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sn bar Holdings' Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22,500,000 restricted shares of Pacific Ventures' common stock while simultaneously issuing 2,500,000 shares of Pacific Ventures' restricted common stock to certain other persons.

The Share Exchange represents a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations.  The business operations will change to that of Sn bar Holdings.

Sn bar Holdings, Inc. ("Sn bar Holdings") was formed in the State of Delaware on January 7, 2013.   Sn bar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of  Snobar  Trust, a California trust ("Trust"), which was formed in June 1, 2013. The current trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge, who is the father of Shannon Masjedi, who controls  Sn bar Holdings.  The Trust owns 100% of the shares of International Production Impex Corporation, a California corporation ("IPIC"), which was formed on August 2, 2001. IPIC  is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops, and holds all of the rights to the liquor licenses to sell such products  and trade names "Sn Bar". As such,  the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC and its liquor licenses, permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors, with all income, expense, gains and losses rolling up to the Trust, of which Sn bar Holdings is the sole beneficiary.  Sn bar Holdings  also owns 99.9% of the shares of MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation ("MGD"). MGD is in the business  of selling and leasing freezers and providing  marketing services.  As a result of the foregoing,  Sn bar Holdings  is the primary beneficiary of all assets, liabilities and any income received from the business of the Trust and IPIC through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD. 

The Trust and IPIC are considered variable interest entities ("VIEs") and Sn bar Holdings is identified as the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. Under ASC 810, Sn bar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment of Sn bar Holdings' management is that Sn bar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC), and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE's economic performance, it was therefore concluded by management that Sn bar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such, the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of Sn bar Holdings since the inception of the Trust, in the case of the Trust, and since the inception of Sn bar Holdings, in the case of IPIC.

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pacific Ventures, Inc., Sn bar Holdings and its subsidiaries, in which Sn bar Holdings has a controlling voting interest and entities consolidated under the variable interest entities ("VIE") provisions of ASC 810, "Consolidation" ("ASC 810"). Inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.

The Company applies the provisions of ASC 810 which provides a framework for identifying VIEs and determining when a company should include the assets, liabilities, non-controlling interests and results of activities of a VIE in its consolidated financial statements.

Pacific Ventures Group, Inc.

Notes to  Unaudited  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

In general, a VIE is a corporation, partnership, limited-liability corporation, trust, or any other legal structure used to conduct activities or hold assets that either (1) has an insufficient amount of equity to carry out its principal activities without additional subordinated financial support, (2) has a group of equity owners that is unable to make significant decisions about its activities, (3) has a group of equity owners that does not have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive returns generated by its operations or (4) the voting rights of some investors are not proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity, their rights to receive the expected residual returns of the entity, or both and substantially all of the entity's activities (for example, providing financing or buying assets) either involve or are conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately fewer voting rights.

ASC 810 requires a VIE to be consolidated by the party with an ownership, contractual or other financial interest in the VIE (a variable interest holder) that has both of the following characteristics: a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and b) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.

A variable interest holder that consolidates the VIE is called the primary beneficiary. If the primary beneficiary     of a variable interest entity (VIE) and the VIE are under common control, the primary beneficiary shall initially measure the assets, liabilities, and non-controlling interests of the VIE at amounts at which they are carried in the accounts of the reporting entity that controls the VIE (or would be carried if the rep  orting entity issued financial statements prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles).   ASC 810 also requires disclosures about VIEs in which the variable interest holder is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. 

2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of Consolidation  - The consolidated financial statements include Pacific Ventures, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Sn bar Holdings, Inc. a Delaware corporation ("Sn bar Holdings"), MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation ("MGD"), International Production Impex Corporation, a California corporation ("IPIC"), and Snobar Trust, a California trust ("Trust"), which was established to hold IPIC, which in turn holds liquor licenses. All inter-company accounts have been eliminated during consolidation.  See the discussion in Note 1 above for variable interest entity treatment of the Trust and IPIC.

Use of Estimates  - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition   - Sales revenues are generally recognized in accordance with the SAB 104 Public Company Guidance, when an agreement exists and price is determinable, the products are shipped to the customers or services are rendered, net of discounts, returns and allowance and collectability is reasonably assured. We are often entitled to bill our customers and receive payment from our customers in advance of recognizing the revenue. In the instances in which we have received payment from our customers in advance of recognizing revenue, we include the amounts in deferred or unearned revenue on our consolidated balance sheet. The Company   neither   earned   nor   recognized   any operating   revenue during the three months ended   9  /30/2016  .  However, the company recognized $18,750 in licensing income during the period  . 

Unearned Revenue   - Certain amounts are received pursuant to agreements or contracts and may only be used in the conduct of specified transactions or the related services are yet to be performed. These amounts are recorded as unearned or deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue in the year/period the related expenses are incurred or services are performed.   As at 9  /30/2016, the Company has $  52,541  .67 in deferred revenue as a result of prepayment by two of its customers.  This is comparable to the Company year-end deferred revenue balance of $90,042 as at 12/31/2015.

Notes to  Unaudited  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Shipping and Handling Costs  - The Company's shipping costs are all recorded as operating expenses for all periods presented.

Disputed Liabilities  - The Company is involved in a variety of disputes, claims, and proceedings concerning its business operations and certain liabilities. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination as to an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for significant amounts, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.  As at 6/30/2016, the Company has $39,307.59 in disputed liabilities on its balance sheet.

Non-Recurring Items     Non-recurring items come from discontinued operations, extraordinary items, unusual or infrequent items, or changes in accounting principles. Because these items are infrequent and did not constitute operating items they are not included in the   Company's   result of operation.  During the three months ended   9  /30/2016 the Company recorded a gain/loss of $0 as non-recurring items. 

Cash Equivalents   - The Company considers highly liquid instruments with original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As at   9  /30/2016, the Company has $  74,724.29   in Cash and Cash equivalent, compared to $  210 as at 12/31  /2015. 

Accounts Receivable   - Accounts receivable are stated at net realizable value. This value includes an appropriate allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts. The allowance is calculated based upon the level of past due accounts and the relationship with and financial status of our customers. The Company did not write off any bad debt during the years ended three months ended   9  /30/2016 and 2015, and thus has not set an allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Inventories   - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost has been determined using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, reserves for excess and unusable inventories are recorded. Inventory consists of finished goods and includes ice cream, popsicles and the related packaging materials.  As at   9  /30/2016, the Company has $0 in   Inventories  , compared to $  2020 as at 12/31  /2015. 

Income Taxes  - Deferred taxes are provided on an asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the difference between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.

Net Income/(Loss) Per Common Share  - Income/(loss) per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net income/(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. The Company has no potentially dilutive securities. Accordingly, basic and dilutive income/(loss) per common share are the same.

Property and Equipment  - Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and includes expenditures that substantially increase the useful lives of existing property and equipment. Maintenance, repairs, and minor renovations are expensed as incurred. Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations. The Company provides for depreciation of property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease, as appropriate. The estimated useful lives are as follows: vehicles, five years; office furniture and equipment, three to fifteen years; equipment, three years.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments  - The carrying amounts of Pacific Ventures' financial instruments, which include cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses are representative of their fair values due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.

Concentration of Credit Risk  - Financial instruments that potentially subject Pacific Ventures to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable. The Company maintains cash balances at financial institutions within the United States which are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") up to limits of approximately $250,000. The Company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash bank accounts.

Advertising Costs   - The Company expenses advertising costs when incurred  .     During the three months ended   9  /30/2016, the Company incurred $  23,032in   Marketing and Advertising, compared to $  29,499   for the three months ended   6/30  /2016. 

Critical Accounting Policies  - The Company considers revenue recognition and the valuation of accounts receivable, allowance for doubtful accounts, and inventory and reserves as its significant accounting policies. Some of these policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts in Pacific Ventures' financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements -  In June 2009, the FASB established the Accounting Standards Codification ("Codification" or "ASC") as the source of authoritative accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP").  Rules and interpretive releases of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") issued under authority of federal securities laws are also sources of GAAP for SEC registrants.  Existing GAAP was not intended to be changed as a result of the Codification, and accordingly the change did not impact our financial statements.  The ASC does change the way the guidance is organized and presented.

In April 2015, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03, "Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", to simplify presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The ASU does not affect the recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. For public companies, the ASU is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-04, "Compensation   Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Practical Expedient for the Measurement Date of an Employer's Defined Benefit Obligation and Plan Assets", which permits the entity to measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations using the month-end that is closest to the entity's fiscal year-end and apply that practical expedient consistently from year to year. The ASU is effective for public business entities for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, "Intangibles   Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement", which provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If such includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for it as a service contract. For public business entities, the ASU is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-06, "Earnings Per Share (Topic 260): Effects on Historical Earnings per Unit of Master Limited Partnership Dropdown Transactions", which specifies that, for purposes of calculating historical earnings per unit under the two-class method, the earnings (losses) of a transferred business before the date of a drop down transaction should be allocated entirely to the general partner. In that circumstance, the previously reported earnings per unit of the limited partners (which is typically the earnings per unit measure presented in the financial statements) would not change as a result of the dropdown transaction. Qualitative disclosures about how the rights to the earnings (losses) differ before and after the dropdown transaction occurs for purposes of computing earnings per unit under the two-class method also are required. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

In June 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-10, "Development Stage Entities (Topic 915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation". The update removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities, including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. In addition, the update adds an example disclosure in Risks and Uncertainties (Topic 275) to illustrate one way that an entity that has not begun planned principal operations could provide information about the risks and uncertainties related to the company's current activities. Furthermore, the update removes an exception provided to development stage entities in Consolidations (Topic 810) for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity-which may change the consolidation analysis, consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements for a company that has an interest in a company in the development stage. The update is effective for the annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014, including interim periods therein. Early application is permitted  with the first annual reporting period or interim period for which the entity's financial statements have not yet been issued (Public business entities) or made available for issuance (other entities). Our company adopted this pronouncement for year ended December 31, 2014.

In June 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, "Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718); Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period". The amendments in this ASU apply to all reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. For all entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Earlier adoption is permitted. Entities may apply the amendments in this ASU either (a) prospectively to all awards granted or modified after the effective date or (b) retrospectively to all awards with performance targets that are outstanding as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements and to all new or modified awards thereafter. If retrospective transition is adopted, the cumulative effect of applying this Update as of the beginning of the earliest annual period presented in the financial statements should be recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance at that date. Additionally, if retrospective transition is adopted, an entity may use hindsight in measuring and recognizing the compensation cost. This updated guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.  We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

Notes to  Unaudited  Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 on "Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern". Currently, there is no guidance in U.S. GAAP about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern or to provide related footnote disclosures. The amendments in this Update provide that guidance. In doing so, the amendments are intended to reduce diversity in the timing and content of footnote disclosures. The amendments require management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently in U.S. auditing standards. Specifically, the amendments (1) provide a definition of the term substantial doubt, (2) require an evaluation every reporting period including interim periods, (3) provide principles for considering the mitigating effect of management's plans, (4) require certain disclosures when substantial doubt is alleviated as a result of consideration of management's plans, (5) require an express statement and other disclosures when substantial doubt is not alleviated, and (6) require an assessment for a period of one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). We are currently reviewing the provisions of this ASU to determine if there will be any impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.

All other newly issued accounting pronouncements which are not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.

We reviewed all other recently issued accounting pronouncements and determined these have no current applicability to the Company or their effect on the financial statements would not have been significant.

3.  GOING CONCERN

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company has incurred a net loss of $  75,060   for the three months ended   September   30, 2016, and has an accumulated deficit of $  5,277,621   of   September   30, 2016. 

In order to continue as a going concern, the Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. The Company is significantly dependent upon its ability, and will continue to attempt, to secure equity and/or additional debt financing. There are no assurances that the Company will be successful and without sufficient financing it would be unlikely for the Company to continue as a going concern.

The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts of and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise from this uncertainty.

4.  INVENTORIES

Inventories at September 30, 2016 and December 3, 12015, consisted of the following:

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CORPORATE HISTORY

Pacific Ventures Group, Inc. (the "Company" or "Pacific Ventures") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on October 3, 1986, under the name AOA Corporation. On November 12, 1991, the Company changed its name to American Eagle Group, Inc. On October 22, 2012, the Company changed its name to Pacific Ventures Group, Inc.

On August 14, 2015, Pacific Ventures Group, Inc. and its stockholders entered into a share exchange agreement with Sn bar Holdings, Inc. ("Sn bar Holdings"), pursuant to which Pacific Ventures acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Sn bar Holdings' Class A and Class B common stock in exchange for 22,500,000 restricted shares of Pacific Ventures' common stock while simultaneously issuing 2,500,000 shares of Pacific Ventures' restricted common stock to certain other persons.

The Share Exchange represents a change in control of the Company and a change in business operations.  The business operations were changed to that of Sn bar Holdings.

Sn bar Holdings, Inc. ("Sn bar Holdings") was formed in the State of Delaware on January 7, 2013.  Sn bar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of Snobar Trust, a California trust ("Trust"), which was formed in June 1, 2013. The current trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge, who is the father of Shannon Masjedi, who controls Sn bar Holdings. The Trust owns 100% of the shares of International Production Impex Corporation, a California corporation ("IPIC"), which was formed on August 2, 2001. IPIC is in the business of selling alcohol-infused ice cream and ice-pops, and holds all of the rights to the liquor licenses to sell such products and trade names "Sn Bar". As such, the Trust holds all ownership interest of IPIC and its liquor licenses, permitting IPIC to sell its product to distributors, with all income, expense, gains and losses rolling up to the Trust, of which Sn bar Holdings is the sole beneficiary.  Sn bar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation ("MGD"). MGD is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services.  As a result of the foregoing, Sn bar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of all assets, liabilities and any income received from the business of the Trust and IPIC through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD.

The Trust and IPIC are considered variable interest entities ("VIEs") and Sn bar Holdings is identified as the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. Under ASC 810, Sn bar Holdings performs ongoing reassessments of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. As the assessment of Sn bar Holdings' management is that Sn bar Holdings has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's activities (it is responsible for establishing and operating IPIC), and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE and the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE's economic performance, it was therefore concluded by management that Sn bar Holdings is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and IPIC. As such, the Trust and IPIC were consolidated in the financial statements of Sn bar Holdings since the inception of the Trust, in the case of the Trust, and since the inception of Sn bar Holdings, in the case of IPIC. 

Our principal executive office is located at 117 West 9th Street, Suite 316, Los Angeles, California.   Our main telephone number is (310) 392-5606.

Operations

Description of Sn bar Holdings, Inc.

GENERAL

Sn bar Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Sn bar Holdings"), was incorporated in the state of Delaware on January 7, 2013. Sn bar Holdings is the trustor and sole beneficiary of Snobar Trust, a California trust ("Trust"), which was formed in June 1, 2013. The trustee that holds legal title to the Trust is Clark Rutledge, who is the father of Shannon Masjedi. The Trust owns 100% of the shares of International Production Impex Corporation, a California corporation ("IPIC"), which was formed on August 2, 2001. IPIC is the owner of liquor licenses and the trade name "Sn Bar" and is in the business of selling and distributing alcohol-infused ice creams and ice-pops through its distributors. Sn bar Holdings also owns 99.9% of the shares of MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation ("MGD"). MGD is in the business of selling and leasing freezers and providing marketing services.  As a matter of law, IPIC may not be engaged in any business similar to MGD.  As a result of the foregoing, Sn bar Holdings is the beneficiary of all assets, liabilities and any income received from the business of IPIC through the Trust and is the parent company of MGD.

IPIC is a food and beverage, alcohol distribution company, that is initially marketing two products: Sn Bar alcohol infused ice pops, and Sn Bar alcohol infused ice cream and sorbet.

Sn Bar ice pops are original frozen alcohol beverage bars, similar to popsicles on a stick, but made with premium liquor such as premium tequila and vodka and are currently manufactured in three flavors, Margarita, Cosmopolitan and Mojito.  The alcohol freezing technology used to produce these beverage bars can be applied to almost any alcohol type and mixture, presenting significant market potential and an almost unlimited variety of flavors and employment of premium brands.  Each ice pop is the equivalent of a full cocktail. 

Sn Bar ice cream is an additional innovative product that the company is marketing using proprietary formulas and technology. These products are premium ice cream and sorbets that are distilled spirit cocktails containing up to 20% quality liqueurs and liquors.  Currently, there are four flavors available: Brandy Alexander; Brandy Alexander with chocolate chips; Grasshopper; and Pink Squirrel.  There are also numerous different liquor ice cream flavors in development in classic ice cream drink styles such as Coffee Liqueur Ice Cream, Pi a Colada Sorbet, Sherry Ice Cream, and Strawberry Margarita Sorbet. The product contains ultra premium dairy and the highest quality of ingredients.

What makes the Sn Bar products unique is the proprietary formulation and method of manufacturing.   Sn Bar ice pops and Sn Bar ice cream use a system to stabilize the alcohol molecule, whereby the alcohol content, quality and flavor is not degraded during the production process. The technology is also applicable to other food and beverage products such as yogurt, water ice creations and alcohol based goods.  IPIC has begun the process of obtaining trade secret and other intellectual property protections as to these unique technologies. The Sn Bar brand is fully trademarked within the USA and is currently seeking worldwide trademark rights.

Sn Bar brand products have been through extensive consumer testing across all age groups and sexes over 21 years of age. According to the results of the consumer testing, there is a large untapped market potential for frozen alcohol desserts. Market research shows that there are very few alcohol infused ice-creams and ice pops available in the U.S. markets and the few that are out there are of lower quality ingredients and are not mass produced. IPIC holds several Federal and State granted liquor licenses.  These licenses allow the Sn Bar product line to be introduced and distributed in 95% of the United States.  IPIC desires to be the first to mass market the Sn Bar alcohol-infused products in this untapped and sizeable market segment and capitalize on these two exclusive products. IPIC only uses the finest of ingredients and dairy to produce Sn Bar products and strives to achieve the highest quality of texture and taste for all of the Sn Bar products. IPIC believes that the Sn Bar brand has the potential to scale on a national and international level with worldwide distribution capabilities.

MARKET

The alcohol and distilled spirits market, and ice cream markets have consistently exhibited year-over-year growth, and are projected to continue this positive trend.  Not only are these products a part of an expanding market segment, but they have been received by a wide range of consumers who find them entertaining and enjoyable to consume.  The alcohol beverage and dessert industries are extremely innovative and continuously add new and original products.  IPIC has determined that capturing even a small portion of these markets would surpass the initial production capabilities of the Sn Bar products and provide a platform for exponential growth nationally and internationally.

In 2012, the Sn Bar brand was introduced in the USA in the state of Arizona. The brand was extremely well received and was immediately placed in the top chain stores and restaurants, resorts including Total Wine and the Bevmo Chains.  Due to its multiple applications and uses, the Sn Bar alcohol infusing technology is used to create exotic and innovative cocktails and the most unique and delicious desserts.  Sn Bar is one of the only few spirit brands that can offer incremental revenues and not compete with other spirits currently on the market.

In 2013, the Sn Bar brand was launched in Nevada. Immediately, the Sn Bar products were in demand in all the major casinos and resorts.   The Sn Bar brand joined forces with reputable hotels and resorts, including, but not limited to, the Bellagio, Golden Nugget, Rio, Wynn, Encore, TAO, Caesars Palace, Hilton, The M and MGM. In Nevada, IPIC's focus is to place the Sn Bar brand within all the venues of the hotels including catering and banquets, room service, retail outlets and nightclubs.

Immediately following Nevada, the Sn Bar brand was launched in the state of Florida, in cities including Miami, Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville and the panhandle. This expansion resulted in Sn Bar products being offered by reputable hotels and resorts, including, but not limited to, Ritz Carlton Hotel, Fountainbleau, Hilton, Waldorf Astoria and The Breakers Resort.

In 2014, the Sn Bar brand was launched in California. Over 100 accounts with retailers for Sn Bar products were established in the 90 day period following the launch in California.  The focus in California has been ensuring that the accounts are reordering product and being serviced and supported properly. Currently, Sn Bar products are being offered by Gelson's Markets and there has also been interest from other chains such as Ralph's (Kroger) and Costco.

Walmart, the largest retailer in the world, approved the Sn Bar brand to be test marketed in a few stores in the Florida market. The first store sold out of more than 10 cases of Sn Bar products within the first two weeks prompting an 85 case reorder. After a three month trial period, Walmart approved the expansion of Sn Bar products in to more stores in the Florida market.

In 2015, the Sn Bar brand was launched in North Carolina and South Carolina teaming up with a distributor who is well known in the market place. The brand has been very well received within the market.

In the first two months of 2015, IPIC restructured its approach to distribution of Sn Bar products and scaled back the operating expenditures by reducing its expenses. Most notably, Sn Bar products are now distributed by a local Nestle Distributor in the California markets resulting in almost a 50% decrease in distribution expenses to IPIC.

IPIC has recently entered into contracts with three international distributors pursuant to which IPIC has licensed to the international distributors a right to distribute Sn Bar products to certain international destinations.  One of the contracts provides for a non-exclusive right to distribute for a minimum term of three years with an aggregate of $725,000 worth of Sn Bar products for distribution in Grand Cayman Island, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and Cuba, if and when trade is permissible with Cuba. Another contract provides for an exclusive right to distribute for a minimum term of two years with an aggregate of $700,000 worth of Sn Bar products for distribution in Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Panama.  The last contract provides for an exclusive right to distribute for a minimum term of two years with an aggregate of $700,000 worth of Sn Bar products for the first year and $300,000 worth of Sn Bar products for each year thereafter for distribution in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Thailand.  IPIC has already received the initial orders from these international distributors.

IPIC is also in negotiations with other international distributors for exportation of Sn Bar products to territories, including Australia, New Zealand and Europe.

IPIC has recently entered into a contract with a distributor in the United States pursuant to which IPIC has licensed to the domestic distributor an exclusive right to distribute Sn Bar products.  The contract provides for a minimum of two years with an aggregate of $500,000 worth of Sn Bar products for distribution in North Carolina and South Carolina.

IPIC is also in negotiations with other domestic distributors for distribution of Sn Bar products to Texas, where a large retail chain named Spec's has approved of offering Sn Bar products for sale, as well as Alabama.

Ice Cream and Ice Pops

While the majority of ice cream sales have long been regular-fat products, ice cream manufacturers continue to diversify their lines of frozen desserts in order to fit into various lifestyles.  However, most consumers are looking for an indulgence when eating ice creams, which makes these products  well situated  with its ideal formula of two enjoyable products, ice cream and alcohol in an affordable combination.

Alcohol

The second ingredient in Sn Bar ice cream and Sn Bar ice pops is alcohol.  The U.S. beverage alcohol market is over $400 billion according to The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States ("DISCUS").  The Sn Bar alcohol-infused ice cream and ice pop products take advantage of the success of the thriving frozen desserts industry and the successful alcohol beverage industry, making Sn Bar ice cream and ice pop products a hybrid of uniqueness conducive to the consumer markets.

OPPORTUNITY

IPIC has created a proprietary formula and the methodology and manufacturing technique to mass produce alcohol-infused ice cream leveraging production facilities, warehousing, distribution, and merchandising methods currently used for ice cream.   Specifically, the proprietary formulation and manufacturing method stabilize the alcohol molecules from interacting with ice crystals and milk proteins making it possible to mass-produce a solid alcohol-infused ice cream that has a flavoring system of up to 20% distilled spirits.  To date, Sn Bar ice cream is one of the only products of its kind in the U.S.

The original invention of these frozen alcohol desserts follows the same recipes used by America's finest bars and restaurants.  The Sn Bar products are distilled spirit cocktails that contain up to 20% quality liqueurs and liquors.  What makes liquor ice cream and sorbet different is that the product is solid just like regular ice cream, not semi-soft or in a milk shake consistency like one would find at bars and restaurants:   These products are ready-to-eat solid or can be blended into a cocktail.   While Sn Bar products look like ice cream and frozen popsicles, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ("ATF") and Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") have classified Sn Bar ice cream and Sn Bar pops as distilled spirits due to the alcohol content.

This formulation positions these two products in a unique market opportunity taking advantage of the $26 billion a year frozen dessert market and the over $400 billion a year alcohol beverage market. A 5 ounce serving represents a significant consumer value when compared to the cost of a traditional drink. Additionally, the concept of a frozen alcohol dessert product is seen by female consumers in our studies as being "innovative" and "fun".

Female consumers have generally been high consumers of the dessert market; consequently, males have been the greater consumer of alcohol.  The primary target market for these two products is adult women 21 to 65. An alcoholic-infused ice cream drink would appear to combine the best of both worlds for the female consumer. Of course, to a large degree the market for frozen alcohol desserts includes all adults, excluding those who have dietary, medical, or social/religious concerns. This presents an opportunity for a new innovative product that specifically addresses both females and males.

IPIC will market and promote the Sn Bar brand utilizing a proprietary manufacturing and freezing method where the alcohol content and flavor is not degraded during the production process.  Sn Bar ice pops are frozen beverage alcohol bars, similar to a popsicle on a stick, and are currently manufactured in three flavors; Margarita, Cosmopolitan, and Mojito.  Both recipes include premium liquors of blue agave tequila and vodka, however, the alcohol freezing technology can be applied to almost any alcohol type and mixture, presenting significant market potential and an almost unlimited variety of flavors and employment of premium brands.

While Sn Bar popsicles are included in the frozen dessert and alcohol beverage category, initially sales are expected to be driven mostly by on-premise accounts.  The spirits category represents over 650,000 licensed retail accounts absorbing sales of over 175 million x 9 liter equivalent cases annually. IPIC can viably reach 30% of this market, approximately 195,000 outlets, accounting for 52.5 million equivalent cases. While a core-target audience of females 21 to 65 years old have been highly accepting and positive regarding the product, our market studies show that the actual acceptance band of the product is much wider, and that if cost is not a purchase condition, most people of drinking age will try one or more.

With a confidential/proprietary formula and exclusive manufacturing process, coupled with a focused launch and national distribution network, IPIC strives to be the first to market in this unique segment and capitalize on a revolutionary product.

STRATEGY

The International Dairy Food Association ("IDFA") reported that approximately 86% of packaged ice cream retail sales occur in supermarkets. Convenience store sales represented 11.4%, drug stores were at nearly 2%, while 0.6% occurred at other locations.

The current marketing strategy is to sell products to high-end restaurants, resorts, cruise lines and hotels.  Additionally, various celebrity branding and product endorsements are currently being explored.  Initially, IPIC will focus on major accounts in four core markets consisting of Southern California, Phoenix, Las Vegas and Miami. The larger vision is to sell products in grocery stores such as Kroger, Wal-Mart and others, and thereafter to begin a national marketing program to all U.S. retailers. It is essentially a top down marketing plan where products are placed with the largest retailer then trickle down to the smallest seller in each market area.

The fact that Sn Bar products are unique and exclusive, allows Sn Bar to bring new consumers and revenue to our vendors, hence creating incremental growth in their overall sales. A national direct mail campaign to liquor retailers and leading food service operators will support these efforts.  By Sn Bar creating a new vehicle for distilled spirits, many consumers will be tasting liqueurs and liquors for the first time, and in the very favorable mixed medium of premium ice cream.

The initial target market for Sn Bar popsicles consists of bars, night clubs, restaurants, resorts, hotels, event banquet and catering firms, and cruise lines. Negotiations are currently underway with several more Las Vegas resorts and a major cruise line to initially launch the Sn Bar products. Heavy attention will also be given to consumer and trade shows in the beverage industry to provide exposure and sampling as well as to enlist new accounts. IPIC intends to provide Sn Bar products to more major groceries stores at a later date.

At the outset, the target consumer is 21 to 34 year olds, predominately females that frequent restaurants, bars, and events on a regular basis.   While the consumer demographic is predominantly female, the slight majority of the purchasers are male for female consumption. Our marketing studies and strategy have identified these trends and structured promotional efforts accordingly.  IPIC will coordinate and oversee all out-sourced brand awareness and public relations activities. Many of the strategies used will be replications of the past successes experienced by management and other similar demographically-oriented products.

MAS Global Distributors, Inc., a California corporation ("MGD"), formed in December 14, 2010, a majority owned subsidiary of Sn bar Holdings, is the sole marketer for Sn Bar ice cream and Sn Bar ice pops. MGD handles all the marketing and promotional aspect for the Sn Bar product line.

- 23 -

Seasonality

While it is anticipated that Sn Bar ice cream will be consumed year round with special holiday flavors and promotions planned, it is anticipated that Sn Bar consumption will be strong in warm climates, specialty venues, cruise lines, resorts, and of course seasonal occasions.

Raw Materials and Other Supplies

The principal raw materials for the production, storage and aging of distilled products are primarily corn and other grains for whiskies and other spirits, agave for tequila, molasses for rum, grapes for cognac, sticks for the popsicles and milk and other dairy products for the ice cream. IPIC does not currently have any long-term supply agreements with third-party suppliers for the purchase of any of raw materials used in our products. From time to time, these raw materials are affected by weather and other forces that may impact production and quality, and, ultimately, their price.

Manufacturing

Due to the confidentiality of the Sn Bar ice cream and Sn Bar formulas and manufacturing processes, IPIC has established a manufacturing agreement with a large frozen dessert manufacturer and packer in Southern California that is large enough to meet initial and all anticipated future demand for the Sn Bar brands. The co-packing facility can scale to handle worldwide demand of the Sn Bar products. The co-packing facility currently manufactures for such retailers as Trader Joes and Whole Foods.

Inventory

IPIC maintains inventory of Sn Bar products with the third-party manufacturer/co-packer of its ice-pops and ice creams, as well as with third-party distributors of its products . IPIC's products that are in inventory may be subject to spoliation, theft, or other hazards that could adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations or business of IPIC. While IPIC tries to take precautions to prevent such occurrences, the ice pops, in particular, require refrigeration to a certain temperature that if not maintained can cause the degradation in the products consistency. Ultimate end consumers may not maintain their freezers at the required temperatures which may cause them to believe that there ice-pops have partially melted and therefore they may return the ice-pops, requiring IPIC to reimburse its distributors and take such product back in to inventory for possible disposal. No assurance can be given that individual consumers will be educated in the proper freezing requirements of the Sn Bar products.

Distribution

In order to scale distribution, Sn Bar will partner with more food, beverage and alcohol distributors. The Sn Bar products are primarily sold through direct sales forces to distributors. The product delivery will occur through frozen distribution channels. Transportation of the product from the manufacturing facility to customers will be handled by third parties contracted by IPIC. IPIC is utilizing frozen warehouse facilities in Los Angeles and Phoenix, and accounts in Las Vegas and Miami will be shipped directly to the distributor.

In addition, IPIC may sell the Sn Bar products through joint ventures with and global or regional duty free customers. IPIC may also sell the Sn Bar products through governmental liquor authorities in jurisdictions where aspects of the purchase and distribution of products that contain alcohol are under government control. Examples of such authorities are the eighteen "control" states (and one county) in the United States and the Liquor Control Boards in Canada.

- 24 -

TRADEMARKS

IPIC sells the Sn Bar products under a number of trademarks, brand names and trade names that are important to its continued success. The Sn Bar brand is fully trademarked within the USA and is currently seeking worldwide trademark rights.  IPIC's business could be adversely affected by the loss of any major brand or by material infringement of its intellectual property rights. The Sn Bar products are also subject to intellectual property risks because existing trademark laws offer only limited protection, and the laws of some countries in which the Sn Bar products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold may not fully protect the Sn Bar products from infringement by others.

COMPETITION

The global distilled spirits industry is very competitive and the dessert industry is very competitive. The Sn Bar products compete on the basis of product quality, brand image, price, service and innovation in response to consumer preferences. While the industry is highly fragmented, major competitors on the alcohol-side of the business include Brown-Forman Corporation, Diageo PLC, Beam, Inc, Pernod Ricard S.A., Bacardi Limited, Davide Campari Milano-S.P .A., Remy Cointreau S.A., and Constellation Brands, Inc. and major competitors on the dessert-side of the business include such premium brands as Haagen Dazs and Dreyer's, which are owned by Nestle's and Ben and Jerry's which is owned by Unilever.

REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT

The production, storage, transportation, distribution and sale of the Sn Bar products are subject to regulation by federal, state, local and foreign authorities. Various countries and local jurisdictions prohibit or restrict the marketing or sale of products containing alcohol in whole or in part.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives regulates the U.S. spirits industry with respect to production, blending, bottling, sales, advertising, and transportation of industry products. Also, each state in the United States regulates the advertising, promotion, transportation, sale, and distribution of such products.  Many of the key markets for IPIC's business, distilled spirits are subject to federal excise taxes and/or customs duties, as well as state/provincial, local and other taxes. Sales of products containing alcohol could be adversely impacted by increases to excise tax rates, which are considered from time to time by U.S. states and municipalities and in other key markets for IPIC's business. The effect of any future excise tax increases in any jurisdiction cannot be determined, but it is possible that any future excise tax increases could have an adverse effect on IPIC's business, financial condition and results of operations.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

IPIC is subject to both U.S. and international laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. In the U.S., the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and Superfund (the environmental program established in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act to address abandoned hazardous waste sites), which imposes joint and severable liability on each potentially responsible party.

EMPLOYEES

As of September 30, 2016, Sn bar Holdings does not have any employees.  IPIC, a  consolidated variable interest entity of  Sn bar Holdings, which conducts the operations of  producing, selling and distributing alcohol-infused ice creams and ice-pops , has five (5) employees as of September 30, 2016.

Revenues 

Sales, net of discounts  for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $0, compared to $17,957 for same period of September 30, 2015.   The deference was due largely to lack of inventory.

Operating Expenses 

Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $90,810, compared to September 30, 2015 amount of $476,369 due to reduced operating activities during the period and a decrease in general and administrative expenses, marketing and advertising, professional fees, research and development, wages and salaries, end of accrual of executive compensation in 2015, IPIC business rights expense and depreciation expense.

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of  September 30, 2016 , we had cash on hand of $74,724 and a working capital deficit of approximately $2 million. We have incurred operating losses, and as at  September 30, 2016 , we have accumulated deficit of $5,277,621.  These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.

Our principal sources of liquidity have been cash generated by issuing new shares of the company's common stock and cash generated from operations.

In order to be able to achieve our strategic goals, we need to further expand our business and financing activities. Expanding market awareness of the Sn Bar products and our international distribution networks, together with further improvement of the Sn Bar products will require future capital and liquidity expansion. Since our inception in January 2013, our shareholders have contributed a significant amount of capital making it possible for us to develop and market the Sn Bar products. To continue to develop our product offerings and expand our services and to realize an international coverage a significant capital increase has been and will continue to be required. We have drafted an investment plan and concluded we should enter in the process of raising additional capital from current shareholders and new investors.

We plan to continue raising capital in order to meet our liquidity needs. However, we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it or to raise capital on favorable terms. If we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms, we may be required to significantly curtail or discontinue operations or obtain funds by entering into financing agreements on unattractive terms.

We do not currently have any contractual restrictions on our ability to incur debt and, accordingly we could incur significant amounts of indebtedness to finance operations. Any such indebtedness could contain covenants which would restrict our operations.

Fiscal three months ended   September   30, 2016 

Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended  September  30, 2016 were $416,593  increasing by about $380,396 compared to the same period in 2015 amount of $36,197, due  to difference in net income and sales of shares between the two reporting period.

Net losses for the three months ended  September  30, 2016 was $395,777 and accumulated deficit was $5,277,621 from the date of inception through  September  30, 2016 was primarily attributed to general and administrative expenses salaries and wages, IPIC business rights expense of $500,000, depreciation expense, marketing and advertising, interest expense, professional fees of and research and development cost exceeding our product gross profit during the period. The change in our accrued expenses was primarily attributable to accrued payroll liabilities on a consolidated basis with IPIC and MGD. The change in our accounts payable was primarily due to timing of vendor invoicing and payments.

Net cash used in investing activities was $0, compared to  September  30, 2015 period amount of $0.

Net cash provided by financing activities was $492,107 for the three months ended  September  30, 2016 primarily derived from the proceeds from the sale of stock and the conversion of debt by debtors into common stock of the Company.

As of  September  30, 2016, we had total current liabilities of $834,261 primarily related to our accounts payable, deferred revenue and accrued expenses.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

There are no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP") requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  The SEC has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain.  

Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed which are described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements.  Although we believe that our estimates, assumptions and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available.  Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments or conditions.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), we have carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our management, and the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September   30, 2016. 

Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO") and Chief Financial Officer ("CFO") has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective in order to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the SEC and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure (see below for further discussion).

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There were no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a- 15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred as of   September   30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION

ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings

There are no legal proceedings that have occurred within the past ten years concerning our directors or officers which involved a criminal conviction, a criminal proceeding, an administrative or civil proceeding limiting one's participation in the securities or banking industries, or a finding of securities or commodities law violations. Except for Shannon Masjedi, who filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2010, which was discharged in August 2011, and Marc Shenkman, who filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2010, which was dismissed but not discharged in May 2012, none of our directors or officers has filed for and has been affiliated with any company that has filed for bankruptcy within the last ten years. We are not aware of any proceedings to which any of our officers or directors, or any associate of any such officer or director, is a party adverse to us or any of our or has a material interest adverse to us or any of our subsidiaries.

From July 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, the company sold 865,000 shares of its common stock to various investors for cash and other considerations.

All securities granted or sold under these agreements are unregistered and may only be resold or transferred if they later become registered or fall under an exemption to the Securities Act or applicable state laws.  Our typical investor or grantee generally relies upon Rule 144 of the Securities Act, which, in addition to requiring several other conditions before resale may occur, requires that the securities issued be held for a minimum of six months.
