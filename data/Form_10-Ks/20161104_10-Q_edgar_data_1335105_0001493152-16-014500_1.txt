1.
Organization and Basis of Presentation   

The
condensed consolidated financial statements of the Lixte Biotechnology Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ( Holdings ),
including its wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, Lixte Biotechnology, Inc. ( Lixte ) (collectively, the  Company ),
at September 30, 2016, and for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, are unaudited. In the opinion
of management of the Company, all adjustments (including normal recurring adjustments) have been made that are necessary to present
fairly the financial position of the Company as of September 30, 2016, and the results of its operations for the three months
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Operating
results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full fiscal year.
The consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company s audited financial statements at
such date.  

The
statements and related notes have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ). Accordingly, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and other information included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC.  

2.
Business   

The
Company is a drug discovery company that uses biomarker technology to identify enzyme targets associated with serious common diseases
and then designs novel compounds to attack those targets. The Company s product pipeline encompasses two major categories
of compounds at various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development that the Company believes have broad therapeutic potential
not only for cancer but also for other debilitating and life-threatening diseases.  

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need for additional capital, as described
below. The Company has not yet commenced any sustainable revenue-generating operations, does not have any positive cash flows
from operations, and is dependent on equity capital to fund its operating requirements.  

The
Company s common stock is traded on the OTCQB operated by the OTC Markets under the symbol  LIXT .  

Going
Concern    

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated
any sustainable revenues from operations to date, and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company has experienced
recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and has financed its working capital requirements
during this period primarily through the recurring sale of its equity securities and the exercise of outstanding warrants. As
a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company s consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, has expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern.  

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity capital to fund
its research and development activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profits. The Company s
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  

Because
the Company is currently engaged in research at a relatively early stage, it will likely take a significant amount of time to
develop any product or intellectual property capable of generating sustainable revenues. Accordingly, the Company s business
is unlikely to generate any sustainable operating revenues in the next several years, and may never do so. In addition, to the
extent that the Company is able to generate revenues through licensing its technologies or through product sales, there can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve positive earnings and operating cash flows.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and money market funds aggregating $669,771. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company
expects to receive a refund of advances made to or through Theradex Systems, Inc. of $181,510 upon the administrative closure
of the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 (which was closed to further patient enrollment in April 2016). Accordingly, at September
30, 2016, the Company believes that it has sufficient resources to complete the analysis of the clinical data, reconcile and pay
the remaining costs owed to the participating clinical sites, and prepare and submit the required Clinical Study Report to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) on the completed Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100, as well as to fund the
Company s ongoing operating expenses, including maintaining its patent portfolio, through at least March 2017.  

The
amount and timing of future cash requirements will depend on the pace and design of the Company s clinical trial program.
As market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurances
that the Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, as and when necessary to continue
to conduct operations. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company
would be required to scale back or discontinue its technology and product development programs and/or clinical trials, or obtain
funds, if available (although there can be no certainty), through strategic alliances that may require the Company to relinquish
rights to certain of its compounds, or to discontinue its operations entirely.  

3.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Principles
of Consolidation    

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) and include the financial statements of Holdings and its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Lixte. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during
the reporting period. Significant estimates include accounting for potential liabilities and the assumptions utilized in valuing
stock-based compensation issued for services. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Cash
Concentrations    

The
Company maintains cash balances with financial institutions in federally-insured accounts. The Company may periodically have cash
balances in banks in excess of FDIC insurance limits. The Company maintains its accounts with financial institutions with high
credit ratings. The Company has not experienced any losses to date resulting from this practice.  

Research
and Development    

Research
and development costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants and outside service providers, patent fees and costs, and
other expenses relating to the acquisition, design, development and testing of the Company s treatments and product candidates.  

Research
and development costs are expensed ratably over the life of the underlying contracts, unless the achievement of milestones, the
completion of contracted work, or other information indicates that a different expensing schedule is more appropriate.  

The
Company retained Theradex Systems, Inc. ( Theradex ), an international contract research organization ( CRO )
that provides professional services for the clinical research and development of pharmaceutical compounds, to be responsible for
managing and administering the Company s Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100. The costs of the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100
that are being paid through Theradex are recorded and expensed based upon the documentation provided by the CRO.  

Payments
made pursuant to research and development contracts are initially recorded as advances on research and development contract services
in the Company s balance sheet and then charged to research and development costs in the Company s statement of operations
as those contract services are performed. Expenses incurred under research and development contracts in excess of amounts advanced
are recorded as research and development contract liabilities in the Company s balance sheet, with a corresponding charge
to research and development costs in the Company s statement of operations. The Company reviews the status of its research
and development contracts on a quarterly basis.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had made advances to or through Theradex aggregating $181,510, which are expected to be refunded
to the Company upon completion of the Company s Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100.  

Patent
Costs    

Due
to the significant uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on
the Company s research efforts and any related patent applications, all patent costs, including patent-related legal and
filing fees, are expensed as incurred. Patent costs were $140,855 and $139,485 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and $338,938 and $351,711 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Patent costs
are included in research and development costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

Accounting
for Preferred Stock    

The
Company accounts for preferred stock as either equity or debt, depending on the specific characteristics of the security issued.
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued by the Company in January 2016 and March 2015 has been classified in stockholders 
equity, as described at Note 5.  

Concentration
of Risk    

The
Company periodically contracts with directors, including companies controlled by or associated with directors, to provide consulting
services related to the Company s research and development and clinical trial activities. Agreements for these services
can be for a specific time period (typically one year) or for a specific project or task, and can include both cash and non-cash
compensation. The only such contract that represents 10% or more of general and administrative or research and development costs
is described below.  

On
September 21, 2012, the Company entered into a work order agreement with Theradex, the CRO responsible for the clinical development
of the Company s lead anti-cancer compound LB-100, to manage and administer the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100. The Phase
1 clinical trial of LB-100, which began during April 2013 with the entry of patients into the clinical trial, was carried out
by nationally recognized comprehensive cancer centers. As the patient accrual goal was reached in April 2016, the clinical trial
was closed to further patient enrollment at that time. All patients completed treatment with LB-100 and were off study by the
end of May 2016. The Company estimates that it will continue to incur costs through December 2016 to complete the analysis of
the clinical data, reconcile and pay the remaining costs owed to the participating clinical sites, and prepare and submit the
required Clinical Study Report to the FDA on the completed Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100.  

The
Phase 1 clinical trial was estimated to cost a total of approximately $2,200,000, with such payments expected to be allocated
approximately 60% for services provided by Theradex and approximately 40% for pass-through costs for clinical center laboratory
costs and investigator costs over the life of the clinical trial. Total costs charged to operations through September 30, 2016
for services paid to or through Theradex pursuant to this arrangement, which were first incurred in 2013, aggregated $2,040,867.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $130,820 and $162,425, respectively, of such clinical trial costs were incurred,
representing approximately 27% and 26% of research and development costs for such periods. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $340,746 and $670,540, respectively, of such clinical trial costs, representing approximately
32% and 47% of research and development costs for such periods. Costs pursuant to this agreement are included in research and
development costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
Accordingly, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected impact of differences between the financial
statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.  

The
Company has elected to deduct research and development costs on a current basis for federal income tax purposes. For federal tax
purposes, start-up and organization costs were deferred until January 1, 2008 at which time the Company began to amortize such
costs over a 180-month period.  

The
Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
In the event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of
its recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination
was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in
the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to operations in the period such determination was made.  

The
Company is subject to U.S. federal income taxes and income taxes of various state tax jurisdictions. As the Company s net
operating losses have yet to be utilized, all previous tax years remain open to examination by Federal authorities and other jurisdictions
in which the Company currently operates or has operated in the past. The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits as of September
30, 2016 and 2015 and does not anticipate any material amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.  

The
Company accounts for uncertainties in income tax law under a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement,
presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns as prescribed by GAAP.
The tax effects of a position are recognized only if it is  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained by the taxing authority
as of the reporting date. If the tax position is not considered  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained, then no benefits
of the position are recognized. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not recorded any liability for uncertain tax positions.
In subsequent periods, any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be recognized as a component of income
tax expense.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company periodically issues common stock and stock options to officers, directors, Scientific Advisory Committee members and consultants
for services rendered. Options vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date of each grant.  

The
Company accounts for stock-based payments to officers and directors by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for
equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the cost recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line
basis in the Company s financial statements over the vesting period of the awards. The Company accounts for stock-based
payments to Scientific Advisory Committee members and consultants by determining the value of the stock compensation based upon
the measurement date at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached or (b) at the date at which the necessary
performance to earn the equity instruments is complete.  

Stock
grants, which are generally time vested, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations ratably over the
vesting period.  

Stock
options granted to members of the Company s Scientific Advisory Committee and to outside consultants are revalued each reporting
period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the stock options vest, they are valued
on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the value on the
date of vesting.  

The
fair value of common stock issued as stock-based compensation is determined by reference to the closing price of the Company s
common stock on the date of issuance. The fair value of stock options granted as stock-based compensation is determined utilizing
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the life of the
equity award, the exercise price of the stock option as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date,
and the estimated volatility of the common stock over the term of the equity award. Estimated volatility is based on the historical
volatility of the Company s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
at the time of grant. The fair market value of common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the Company s
common stock.  

The
Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation awards in general and administrative costs and in research and development
costs, as appropriate, in the Company s condensed consolidated statement of operations. The Company issues new shares of
common stock to satisfy stock option exercises.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenue when all four of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists;
(ii) delivery of the products and/or services has occurred; (iii) the fees earned can be readily determined; and (iv) collectability
of the fees is reasonably assured.  

Revenues
from milestone payments under license agreements are recognized when earned and the Company has no further performance obligations
thereunder.

of comprehensive income or loss, including net income or loss, are reported in the financial statements in the period in which
they are recognized. Comprehensive income or loss is defined as the change in equity during a period from transactions and other
events and circumstances from non-owner sources. Net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) are reported net of any
related tax effect to arrive at comprehensive income (loss). The Company did not have any items of comprehensive income (loss)
for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Earnings
(Loss) Per Share    

The
Company s computation of earnings (loss) per share ( EPS ) includes basic and diluted EPS. Basic EPS is measured
as the income (loss) attributable to common stockholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period.
Diluted EPS is similar to basic EPS but presents the dilutive effect on a per share basis of potential common shares (e.g., preferred
shares, warrants and stock options) as if they had been converted at the beginning of the periods presented, or issuance date,
if later. Potential common shares that have an anti-dilutive effect (i.e., those that increase income per share or decrease loss
per share) are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS.  

Net
income (loss) attributable to common stockholders consists of net income or loss, as adjusted for preferred stock dividends declared,
amortized or accumulated.  

Loss
per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during
the respective periods. Basic and diluted loss per common share is the same for all periods presented because all preferred shares,
warrants and stock options outstanding are anti-dilutive.  

At
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company excluded the outstanding securities summarized below, which entitle the holders thereof
to acquire shares of common stock, from its calculation of earnings per share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
authoritative guidance with respect to fair value established a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation
techniques used to measure fair value into three levels, and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified
and disclosed in one of three categories, as presented below. Disclosure as to transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2, and activity
in Level 3 fair value measurements, is also required.  

Level
1. Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for an identical asset or liability that the Company has the ability
to access as of the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active-exchange traded
securities and exchange-based derivatives.  

Level
2. Inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, which are directly observable for the asset or liability or indirectly
observable through corroboration with observable market data. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 2 inputs include
fixed income securities, non-exchange based derivatives, mutual funds, and fair-value hedges.  

Level
3. Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data for the asset or liability which requires the reporting entity
to develop its own assumptions. Financial assets and liabilities utilizing Level 3 inputs include infrequently-traded non-exchange-based
derivatives and commingled investment funds, and are measured using present value pricing models.  

The
Company determines the level in the fair value hierarchy within which each fair value measurement falls in its entirety, based
on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. In determining the appropriate levels,
the Company performs an analysis of the assets and liabilities at each reporting period end.  

Money
market funds are the only financial instrument that is measured and recorded at fair value on the Company s consolidated
balance sheet on a recurring basis.  

The
carrying value of financial instruments (consisting of cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses) is considered to be representative
of their respective fair values due to the short-term nature of those instruments.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09),
Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance
under current GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require
that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09
also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from
customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain
or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted
only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of
the date of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2014-09 is not expected to have any impact on the Company s financial statement
presentation or disclosures.  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15), Presentation of Financial Statements  
Going Concern (Subtopic 205-10). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there
is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures.
In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity s management should
evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one
year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management s evaluation should
be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are
issued (or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that
it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the
financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December
15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is
not expected to have any impact on the Company s financial statement presentation or disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 (ASU 2016-02), Leases (Topic 842). ASU 2016-02 requires
a lessee to record a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease
payments, on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months, as well as the disclosure of key information about
leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 requires recognition in the statement of operations of a single lease cost, calculated so that
the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term, generally on a straight-line basis. ASU 2016-02 requires classification
of all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. Disclosures are required to provide the amount,
timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees
for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented
in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted. The Company has
not yet evaluated the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company s financial statement presentation and
disclosures.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 (ASU 2016-09), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic
718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 requires, among other things, that all income tax effects
of awards be recognized in the statement of operations when the awards vest or are settled. ASU 2016-09 also allows for an employer
to repurchase more of an employee's shares than it can today for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting
and allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any
interim or annual period. The adoption of ASU 2016-09 is not expected to have any impact on the Company s financial statement
presentation or disclosures.  

Management
does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have
a material impact on the Company s financial statement presentation or disclosures.

License Agreement   

Effective
December 25, 2015, the Company entered into a License Agreement (the  TMU License Agreement ) with Taipei Medical
University ( TMU ), pursuant to which the Company granted to TMU an exclusive license of its lead anti-cancer compound
LB-100 in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) in Asia. Under the TMU License Agreement, TMU will determine
the effectiveness of LB-100 against HCC in clinical trials conducted in accordance with both Taiwan and United States regulatory
requirements.  

Under
the TMU License Agreement, TMU is obligated to make non-refundable milestone payments to the Company of $200,000 within ninety
days from the effective date of December 25, 2015, $50,000 upon the completion of the first Phase 1b/2 clinical trial, $150,000
upon the completion of the first Phase 3 clinical trial, and $200,000 upon the first filing of a New Drug Application ( NDA )
with the FDA or a comparable non-United States regulatory authority. During the term of the TMU License Agreement, TMU will also
pay earned royalties of 10% on cumulative net sales, and 10% to 15% on non-sale based sub-license income. A Phase 1b/2 clinical
trial of LB-100 plus doxorubicin, to be managed and funded by TMU, is expected to commence during the first quarter of 2017.  

The
Company did not have any further performance obligations under the TMU License Agreement on the December 25, 2015 effective date.
Accordingly, as the $200,000 licensing fee was fully earned on the December 25, 2015 effective date, the Company recorded such
amount as licensing revenues and license fee receivable at December 31, 2015. The Company received the $200,000 milestone payment
on March 18, 2016.

Stockholders  Equity   

Preferred
Stock    

The
Company has authorized a total of 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. On March 17, 2015, the Company
filed a Certificate of Designations, Preferences, Rights and Limitations (the  Certificate of Designations ) of its
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock with the Delaware Secretary of State to amend the Company s certificate of incorporation.
The Company designated 175,000 shares as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, which are non-voting and are not subject to increase
without the written consent of a majority of the holders of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock or as otherwise set forth
in the Certificate of Designations. The holders of each 175,000 share tranche of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock are
entitled to receive a per share dividend equal to 1% of the annual net revenue of the Company divided by 175,000, until converted
or redeemed.  

Effective
January 28, 2016, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock Certificate of Designations was amended to increase the authorized
shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock from 175,000 shares to 350,000 shares. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2016, 9,650,000
shares of preferred stock were undesignated and may be issued with such rights and powers as the Board of Directors may designate.  

Effective
March 17, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with a stockholder of the Company who owned 10.6% of
the Company s issued and outstanding shares of common stock immediately prior to this transaction, pursuant to which such
stockholder purchased 175,000 shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at $10.00 per share, representing
an aggregate purchase price of $1,750,000.  

Effective
January 21, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with the holder of the Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock previously sold on March 17, 2015, pursuant to which the Company sold an additional 175,000 shares of Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock at $10.00 per share, representing an aggregate purchase price of $1,750,000.  

Based
on the Company s net revenues of $200,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a dividend of $2,000
on the shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding at December 31, 2015. The dividend was recorded as
of December 31, 2015 and was presented as a current liability in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet at such
date. The dividend was paid in cash on May 1, 2016.  

Each
share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock may be converted, at the option of the holder, into 12.5 shares of common stock
(subject to customary anti-dilution provisions) and the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock is subject to mandatory conversion
at the conversion rate in the event of a merger or sale transaction resulting in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $21,875,000.
The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has a liquidation preference based on its assumed conversion into shares of common stock.  

If
fully converted, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock sold in the March 17, 2015 closing would convert into 2,187,500 shares
of common stock, representing an effective price per share of common stock of $0.80. On March 17, 2015, the closing price of the
Company s common stock was $0.25 per share. If fully converted, the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock sold in the January
21, 2016 closing would also convert into 2,187,500 shares of common stock, representing an effective price per share of common
stock of $0.80. On January 21, 2016, the closing price of the Company s common stock was $0.22 per share. The Company has
the right to redeem the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock up to the fifth anniversary of the respective closing dates at a
price per share equal to $50.00. The Series A Convertible Preferred Stock has no right to cash, except for the payment of the
aforementioned dividend based on the generation of revenues by the Company, and does not have any registration rights.  

Based
on the attributes of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock described above, the Company has determined to account for the Series
A Convertible Preferred Stock as a permanent component of stockholders  equity. Legal costs of $12,608 incurred with respect
to the issuance of the Series A Convertible Preferred Stock on March 17, 2015 were charged directly to additional paid-in capital.
The Company did not incur any material costs with respect to the sale of the Convertible Preferred Stock on January 21, 2016.  

Common
Stock    

Effective
March 17, 2015, the Company s Chairman and major stockholder converted advances due to him aggregating $92,717 into 92,717
shares of the Company s common stock, reflecting an effective price of $1.00 per share. On the effective date of the transaction,
the closing price of the Company s common stock was $0.25 per share. The Company accounted for this transaction as a capital
transaction.  

Information
with respect to the issuance of common stock in connection with various stock-based compensation arrangements is provided at Note
8.  

Common
Stock Warrants    

On
March 6, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors extended to April 15, 2015 the outstanding warrants to acquire 2,928,800
shares of the Company s common stock, which were then currently scheduled to expire on March 31, 2015, and discounted the
cash exercise prices of the warrants by 50%. Warrants so extended and discounted consisted of 1,075,000 warrants currently exercisable
at $0.75 per share and 1,853,800 warrants currently exercisable at $0.50 per share. The difference in the fair value of the warrants
immediately before and after the grant of the extensions, as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was
determined to be $34,016 (average of $0.01 per share), and such amount was charged to operations on March 6, 2015. The fair value
of the warrant extensions was calculated using the following input variables: stock price - $0.30 per share; exercise price -
$0.50 and $0.75 per share; expected life   25 to 40 days; expected volatility   199%; expected dividend yield - 0%;
risk-free interest rate   0.01%. The difference in the fair value of the warrants immediately before and after the grant
of the discount, as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was determined to be $171,757 (an average of
$0.06 per share), and such amount was charged to operations on March 6, 2015. The fair value of the warrant discount was calculated
using the following input variables: stock price - $0.30 per share; exercise price - $0.50 and $0.75 per share to $0.25 and $0.375
per share, respectively; expected life   15 days (the period during which the discount was available); expected volatility
  199%; expected dividend yield - 0%; risk-free interest rate   0.01%.  

As
a result of the March 6, 2015 warrant extension and discount offers, warrants to acquire 1,050,000 shares of the Company s
common stock were exercised in April 2015 (including warrants to acquire 500,000 shares of common stock by Dr. Debbie Schwartzberg,
an affiliate of the Company, and 300,000 shares of common stock by Philip F. Palmedo, a director of the Company) at exercise prices
ranging from $0.25 to $0.375 per share. The exercise of the warrants generated aggregate net proceeds to the Company of $315,000
(average exercise price of $0.30 per share).  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no warrants outstanding to purchase common stock.

Money Market Funds   

Investments
in money market funds at December 31, 2015 consisted of shares of Morgan Stanley New York Municipal Money Market Trust with a
fair value of $104,095.  

The
Morgan Stanley New York Municipal Money Market Trust is an open-end fund incorporated in the United States. The fund invests in
high quality, short-term municipal obligations that pay interest exempt from federal and New York state income taxes.

Company did not have any investments in money market funds at September 30, 2016.  

7.
Related Party Transactions   

The
Company had advances from its Chairman and major stockholder, Dr. John Kovach, aggregating $92,717, which were non-interest bearing,
due on demand, and included in current liabilities in the Company s consolidated balance sheets through December 31, 2014.
Effective March 17, 2015, such advances were converted into 92,717 shares of the Company s common stock, reflecting an effective
price of $1.00 per share. On the effective date of the transaction, the closing price of the Company s common stock was
$0.25 per share.  

Dr.
Kovach was paid a salary of $15,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $45,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, which amounts are included in general and administrative costs in the Company s condensed consolidated
statements of operations.  

Dr.
Kovach is not involved in other business activities but could, in the future, become involved in other business opportunities
that become available. Accordingly, Dr. Kovach may face a conflict in selecting between the Company and his other business interests.
The Company has not yet formulated a policy for the resolution of such potential conflicts.  

The
Company s principal office facilities have been provided without charge by Dr. Kovach. Such costs were not material to the
Company s consolidated financial statements and, accordingly, have not been reflected therein.  

Legal
and consulting fees charged to operations for services rendered by the Eric Forman Law Office were $12,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $36,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Eric J. Forman is the son-in-law
of Gil Schwartzberg, a significant stockholder of and consultant to the Company, and is the son of Dr. Stephen J. Forman, who
was elected to the Company s Board of Directors on May 13, 2016. Julie Forman, the wife of Eric Forman and the daughter
of Gil Schwartzberg (a significant stockholder of and consultant to the Company, as described at Note 8), is Vice President of
Morgan Stanley Wealth Management and has been involved with the Company s investment in money market funds as described
at Note 6.  

Effective
January 1, 2014, the Company entered into an Advisory Agreement with Dr. Kathleen P. Mullinix, a member of the Board of Directors
of the Company, effective for an initial term of one year through December 31, 2014 to advise on business development matters.
The Advisory Agreement provided for annual cash compensation of $25,000. The term of the Advisory Agreement is automatically extended
for a term of one year annually unless a notice of intent to terminate is given by either party at least 90 days before the end
of the applicable term. Accordingly, the Advisory Agreement was extended for additional terms of one year effective January 1,
2015 and 2016. The Company recognized a charge to operations of $6,250 as consulting and advisory fees pursuant to this Advisory
Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $18,750 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, which were included in general and administrative costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of
operations.  

Stock-based
compensation arrangements involving members of the Company s Board of Directors and affiliates are described at Note 8.
Total stock-based compensation expense relating to directors, officers, affiliates and related parties was $3,930 and $0 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Total stock-based compensation expense relating to directors, officers,
affiliates and related parties was $105,334 and $74,901 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation   

The
Company issues common stock and stock options as incentive compensation to directors and as compensation for the services of independent
contractors and consultants of the Company.  

On
June 20, 2007, the Board of Directors of the Company approved the 2007 Stock Compensation Plan (the  2007 Plan ),
which provides for the granting of awards, consisting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, or restricted
shares of common stock, to employees and independent contractors, for up to 2,500,000 shares of the Company s common stock,
under terms and condition, as determined by the Company s Board of Directors. As of September 30, 2016, unexpired stock
options for 1,700,000 shares were issued and outstanding under the 2007 Plan, and stock options for 800,000 were available for
issuance under the 2007 Plan.  

The
fair value of each stock option awarded is estimated on the date of grant and subsequent measurement dates using the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model. The expected dividend yield assumption is based on the Company s expectation of dividend payouts.
The expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company s stock. The risk-free interest rate is based
on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect as of the grant date. The expected life of the stock options is the average of the
vesting term and the full contractual term of the stock options.  

For
stock options requiring an assessment of value during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the fair value of each stock option
award was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  

For
stock options requiring an assessment of value during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the fair value of each stock option
award was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:  

On
January 28, 2014, the Company approved a second amendment to the Company s consulting agreement with Gil Schwartzberg, a
significant stockholder of and consultant to the Company, dated September 12, 2007 to extend it for an additional four years to
January 28, 2019 and granted to Mr. Schwartzberg stock options to purchase an additional aggregate of 4,000,000 shares of common
stock, exercisable for a period of the earlier of five years from the grant date or the termination of the consulting agreement
at $0.50 per share, with one-half of the stock options (2,000,000 shares) vesting immediately and one-half of the stock options
(2,000,000 shares) vesting on January 28, 2015. The fair value of these stock options, as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, was determined to be $596,400 ($0.15 per share) on January 28, 2014, of which $298,200 was attributable
to the stock options that were fully vested on January 28, 2014 and was therefore charged to operations on that date. The remaining
unvested portion of the fair value of the stock options was charged to operations ratably from January 28, 2014 through January
28, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a charge to operations of $74,901 with respect
to these stock options.  

On
December 24, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with NDA Consulting Corp. ( NDA ) for consultation and advice
in the field of oncology research and drug development. As part of the agreement, NDA also agreed to cause its president, Dr.
Daniel D. Von Hoff, M.D., to become a member of the Company s Scientific Advisory Committee. In connection with this agreement,
NDA was granted stock options to purchase 100,000 shares of the Company s common stock, vesting 25,000 shares on June 24,
2014, and thereafter 25,000 shares annually on June 24, 2015, 2016 and 2017, exercisable for a period of five years from the date
of grant at $0.13 per share, which was the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the grant date. The fair value
of these stock options, as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was initially determined to be $12,960
($0.13 per share), and is being charged to operations ratably from December 24, 2013 through June 24,2017. During the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a charge (credit) to operations of $1,494 and $(4,056), respectively,
with respect to these stock options. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a (credit)
charge to operations of $(3,048) and $(186), respectively, with respect to these stock options.  

On
October 7, 2014, the Company entered into an Advisory Agreement with Andrew Robell for consultation and advice with respect to
identifying and assessing potential licensing and strategic opportunities through September 30, 2016. In connection with the agreement,
the Company granted stock options to Mr. Robell to purchase 200,000 shares of the Company s common stock, vesting 100,000
shares on October 7, 2014 and 100,000 shares on October 7, 2015, exercisable for a period of five years from the date of grant
at $0.50 per share. The fair value of these stock options, as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was
determined to be $20,000 ($0.10 per share), of which $10,000 was attributable to the stock options fully-vested on October 7,
2014 and was therefore charged to operations on that date. The remaining unvested portion of the fair value of the stock options
was charged to operations ratably from October 7, 2014 through October 7, 2015. During the three months and nine months ended
September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a (credit) charge to operations of $(3,341) and $9,775, respectively, with respect to
these stock options.  

On
October 7, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with ProActive Capital Resources Group LLC ( ProActive ) for
strategic advisory, investor relations and public relations services through October 6, 2015. In connection with the agreement,
the Company agreed to pay ProActive a monthly fee of $1,500 in cash and agreed to issue to ProActive 250,000 shares of the Company s
common stock, vesting 125,000 shares upon execution of the agreement on October 7, 2014 and 125,000 shares six months thereafter
on April 7, 2015. Additionally, the Company issued a stock option in the form of a warrant to ProActive to purchase 500,000 shares
of the Company s common stock, vesting upon execution of the agreement on October 7, 2014, and exercisable for a period
of one year from the date of grant at $0.25 per share. The fair value of the warrant, as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes
option-pricing model, was determined to be $33,000 ($0.066 per share). The Company inadvertently neglected to timely record a
charge to operations in 2014 of $45,500 with respect to this transaction, as well as to record a portion of the fair value of
the remaining unvested 125,000 shares in 2014 (which had a fair value on the grant date of $12,500). The Company recorded a charge
to operations for the aggregate fair value of these securities of $76,750 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Management
performed an evaluation with respect to this matter and determined that this correction was not qualitatively or quantitatively
material to the Company s financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 or 2015, and thus determined that no
restatement of such prior periods was necessary or appropriate under the circumstances.  

Effective
September 14, 2015, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement with BioPharmaWorks LLC ( BioPharmaWorks ),
pursuant to which the Company engaged BioPharmaWorks to perform certain services for the Company as described at Note 9. In connection
with the Collaboration Agreement, the Company agreed to issue to BioPharmaWorks 1,000,000 fully-vested shares of the Company s
common stock, valued at $260,000, based upon the closing price of the Company s common stock of $0.26 per share, on September
14, 2015. Additionally, the Company issued to BioPharmaWorks two options in the form of warrants to purchase 1,000,000 shares
(500,000 shares per warrant) of the Company s common stock. The first warrant will vest on September 14, 2016, and is exercisable
for a period of five years from the date of grant at $1.00 per share. The second warrant will vest on September 14, 2017, and
is exercisable for a period of five years from the date of grant at $2.00 per share. The fair value of the first and second warrants,
as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was determined to be $128,400 ($0.2568 per share) and $127,850
($0.2557 per share), respectively. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a charge to
operations of $36,313 and $265,157, respectively, with respect to these common shares and warrants. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a charge to operations of $79,337 and $265,157, respectively, with respect to
these common shares and warrants.  

On
November 28, 2015, the Company entered into a two-year advisory agreement with Dr. Fritz Henn, M.D., Ph.D., for consultation and
advice on the development of certain of the Company s products for clinical neurological and neuropsychiatric applications.
Dr. Henn is an internationally recognized investigative neuroscientist and psychiatrist. In connection with the advisory agreement,

100,000 shares vesting on November 28, 2015, and 100,000 shares vesting on November 28, 2016. The stock options are exercisable
for a period of five years from the grant date at $0.50 per share. The fair value of these stock options, as calculated pursuant
to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was initially determined to be $103,360 ($0.5168 per share), of which $51,680 was attributable
to the stock options fully-vested on November 28, 2015 and was therefore charged to operations on that date. The remaining unvested
portion of the fair value of the stock options is being charged to operations ratably from November 28, 2015 through November
28, 2016. During the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a charge to operations of $5,163

Commitments and Contingencies   

The
Company is not currently subject to any pending or threatened legal actions or claims.  

Significant
agreements and contracts are summarized as follows:  

On
September 21, 2012, the Company entered into a work order agreement with Theradex, the CRO responsible for the clinical development
of the Company s lead anti-cancer compound LB-100, to manage and administer the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100. The Phase
1 clinical trial of LB-100, which began during April 2013 with the entry of patients into the clinical trial, was carried out
by nationally recognized comprehensive cancer centers. As the patient accrual goal was reached in April 2016, the clinical trial
was closed to further patient enrollment at that time. All patients completed treatment with LB-100 and were off study by the
end of May 2016. The Company estimates that it will continue to incur costs through December 2016 to complete the analysis of
the clinical data, reconcile and pay the remaining costs owed to the participating clinical sites, and prepare and submit the
required Clinical Study Report to the FDA on the completed Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100.  

The
Phase 1 clinical trial was estimated to cost a total of approximately $2,200,000, with such payments expected to be allocated
approximately 60% for services provided by Theradex and approximately 40% for pass-through costs for clinical center laboratory
costs and investigator costs over the life of the clinical trial. Total costs charged to operations through September 30, 2016
for services paid to or through Theradex pursuant to this arrangement, which were first incurred in 2013, aggregated $2,040,867.  

On
December 24, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with NDA Consulting Corp. ( NDA ) for consultation and advice
in the field of oncology research and drug development. As part of the agreement, NDA also agreed to cause its president, Dr.
Daniel D. Von Hoff, M.D., to become a member of the Company s Scientific Advisory Committee. The term of the agreement was
for one year and provided for a quarterly cash fee of $4,000. The agreement was automatically renewed on its anniversary date
for an additional one-year term. Consulting and advisory fees charged to operations pursuant to this agreement were $4,000 during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $12,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Effective

of the Company, effective for an initial term of one year through December 31, 2014 to advise on business development matters.
The Advisory Agreement provided for annual cash compensation of $25,000. The term of the Advisory Agreement was automatically
extended for a term of one year annually unless a notice of intent to terminate was given by either party at least 90 days before
the end of the applicable term. Accordingly, the Advisory Agreement was extended for additional terms of one year effective January
1, 2015 and 2016. The Company recognized a charge to operations of $6,250 as consulting and advisory fees pursuant to this Advisory
Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $18,750 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015.  

On
October 7, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with ProActive Capital Resources Group LLC for strategic advisory, investor
relations and public relations services through October 6, 2015. Among other things, the agreement provided for compensation in
the form of a monthly cash fee of $1,500. The Company recorded a charge to operations pursuant to this agreement of $4,500 and
$13,500 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Effective
September 14, 2015, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement with BioPharmaWorks, pursuant to which the Company engaged
BioPharmaWorks to perform certain services for the Company. Those services include, among other things: (a) assisting the Company
to (i) commercialize its products and strengthen its patent portfolio, (ii) identify large pharmaceutical companies with potential
interest in the Company s product pipeline, and (iii) prepare and deliver presentations concerning the Company s products;
(b) at the request of the Board of Directors, serving as backup management for up to three months should the Company s Chief
Executive Officer and scientific leader be temporarily unable to carry out his duties; (c) being available for consultation in
drug discovery and development; and (d) identifying providers and overseeing tasks relating to clinical use and commercialization
of new compounds. BioPharmaWorks was founded in 2015 by former Pfizer scientists with extensive multi-disciplinary research and
development and drug development experience. The Collaboration Agreement is for an initial term of two years and automatically
renews for subsequent annual periods unless terminated by a party not less than 60 days prior to the expiration of the applicable
period. In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, the Company agreed to pay BioPharmaWorks a monthly fee of $10,000, subject
to the right of the Company to pay a negotiated hourly rate in lieu of the monthly payment, and agreed to issue to BioPharmaWorks
certain equity-based compensation as described at Note 8. The Company recorded a charge to operations pursuant to this Collaboration
Agreement of $30,000 and $90,000 during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Overview   

Lixte
Biotechnology Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, including its wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, Lixte Biotechnology, Inc.
(collectively, the  Company ), is a drug discovery company that uses biomarker technology to identify enzyme targets
associated with serious common diseases and then designs novel compounds to attack those targets. The Company s product
pipeline encompasses two major categories of compounds at various stages of pre-clinical and clinical development that the Company
believes have broad therapeutic potential not only for cancer but also for other debilitating and life-threatening diseases.  

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including the need for additional capital, as described
below. The Company has not yet commenced any sustainable revenue-generating operations, does not have any positive cash flows
from operations, and is dependent on equity capital to fund its operating requirements.  

The
Company s common stock is traded on the OTCQB operated by the OTC Markets under the symbol  LIXT .  

Going
Concern   

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated
any sustainable revenues from operations to date, and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company has experienced
recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and has financed its working capital requirements
during this period primarily through the recurring sale of its equity securities and the exercise of outstanding warrants. As
a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company s consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, has expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern.  

The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to raise additional equity capital to fund
its research and development activities and to ultimately achieve sustainable operating revenues and profits. The Company s
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.  

Because
the Company is currently engaged in research at a relatively early stage, it will likely take a significant amount of time to
develop any product or intellectual property capable of generating sustainable revenues. Accordingly, the Company s business
is unlikely to generate any sustainable operating revenues in the next several years, and may never do so. In addition, to the
extent that the Company is able to generate revenues through licensing its technologies or through product sales, there can be
no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve positive earnings and operating cash flows.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and money market funds aggregating $669,771. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company
expects to receive a refund of advances made to or through Theradex Systems, Inc. of $181,510 upon the administrative closure
of the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 (which was closed to further patient enrollment in April 2016). Accordingly, at September
30, 2016, the Company believes that it has sufficient resources to complete the analysis of the clinical data, reconcile and pay
the remaining costs owed to the participating clinical sites, and prepare and submit the required Clinical Study Report to the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) on the completed Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100, as well as to fund the
Company s ongoing operating expenses, including maintaining its patent portfolio, through at least March 2017.  

The
amount and timing of future cash requirements will depend on the pace and design of the Company s clinical trial program.
As market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurances
that the Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, as and when necessary to continue
to conduct operations. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company
would be required to scale back or discontinue its technology and product development programs and/or clinical trials, or obtain
funds, if available (although there can be no certainty), through strategic alliances that may require the Company to relinquish
rights to certain of its compounds, or to discontinue its operations entirely.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

Information
with respect to recently issued accounting standards is provided at Note 3 to the Company s condensed consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this document.  

Concentration
of Risk   

The
Company periodically contracts with directors, including companies controlled by or associated with directors, to provide consulting
services related to the Company s research and development and clinical trial activities. Agreements for these services
can be for a specific time period (typically one year) or for a specific project or task, and can include both cash and non-cash
compensation. The only such contract that represents 10% or more of general and administrative or research and development costs
is described below.  

On
September 21, 2012, the Company entered into a work order agreement with Theradex, the CRO responsible for the clinical development
of the Company s lead anti-cancer compound LB-100, to manage and administer the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100. The Phase
1 clinical trial of LB-100, which began during April 2013 with the entry of patients into the clinical trial, was carried out
by nationally recognized comprehensive cancer centers. As the patient accrual goal was reached in April 2016, the clinical trial
was closed to further patient enrollment at that time. All patients completed treatment with LB-100 and were off study by the
end of May 2016. The Company estimates that it will continue to incur costs through December 2016 to complete the analysis of
the clinical data, reconcile and pay the remaining costs owed to the participating clinical sites, and prepare and submit the
required Clinical Study Report to the FDA on the completed Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100.  

The
Phase 1 clinical trial was estimated to cost a total of approximately $2,200,000, with such payments expected to be allocated
approximately 60% for services provided by Theradex and approximately 40% for pass-through costs for clinical center laboratory
costs and investigator costs over the life of the clinical trial. Total costs charged to operations through September 30, 2016
for services paid to or through Theradex pursuant to this arrangement, which were first incurred in 2013, aggregated $2,040,867.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, $130,820 and $162,425, respectively, of such clinical trial costs were incurred,
representing approximately 27% and 26% of research and development costs for such periods. During the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $340,746 and $670,540, respectively, of such clinical trial costs, representing approximately
32% and 47% of research and development costs for such periods. Costs pursuant to this agreement are included in research and
development costs in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

The
Company prepared its condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management periodically evaluates
the estimates and judgments made. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various factors
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates as a result of different
assumptions or conditions.  

The
following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the Company s
condensed consolidated financial statements.  

Research
and Development   

Research
and development costs consist primarily of fees paid to consultants and outside service providers, patent fees and costs, and
other expenses relating to the acquisition, design, development and testing of the Company s treatments and product candidates.  

Research
and development costs are expensed ratably over the life of the underlying contracts, unless the achievement of milestones, the
completion of contracted work, or other information indicates that a different expensing schedule is more appropriate.  

The
Company retained Theradex Systems, Inc. ( Theradex ), an international contract research organization ( CRO )
that provides professional services for the clinical research and development of pharmaceutical compounds, to be responsible for
managing and administering the Company s Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100. The costs of the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100
that are being paid through Theradex are recorded and expensed based upon the documentation provided by the CRO.  

Payments
made pursuant to research and development contracts are initially recorded as advances on research and development contract services
in the Company s balance sheet and then charged to research and development costs in the Company s statement of operations
as those contract services are performed. Expenses incurred under research and development contracts in excess of amounts advanced
are recorded as research and development contract liabilities in the Company s balance sheet, with a corresponding charge
to research and development costs in the Company s statement of operations. The Company reviews the status of its research
and development contracts on a quarterly basis.  

Patent
Costs   

Due
to the significant uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on
the Company s research efforts and any related patent applications, all patent costs, including patent-related legal and
filing fees, are expensed as incurred.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company periodically issues common stock and stock options to officers, directors, Scientific Advisory Committee members and consultants
for services rendered. Options vest and expire according to terms established at the issuance date of each grant.  

The
Company accounts for stock-based payments to officers and directors by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for
equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards, with the cost recognized as compensation expense on the straight-line
basis in the Company s financial statements over the vesting period of the awards. The Company accounts for stock-based
payments to Scientific Advisory Committee members and consultants by determining the value of the stock compensation based upon
the measurement date at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached or (b) at the date at which the necessary
performance to earn the equity instruments is complete.  

Stock
grants, which are generally time vested, are measured at the grant date fair value and charged to operations ratably over the
vesting period.  

Stock
options granted to members of the Company s Scientific Advisory Committee and to outside consultants are revalued each reporting
period to determine the amount to be recorded as an expense in the respective period. As the stock options vest, they are valued
on each vesting date and an adjustment is recorded for the difference between the value already recorded and the value on the
date of vesting.  

The
fair value of common stock issued as stock-based compensation is determined by reference to the closing price of the Company s
common stock on the date of issuance. The fair value of stock options granted as stock-based compensation is determined utilizing
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, and is affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the life of the
equity award, the exercise price of the stock option as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date,
and the estimated volatility of the common stock over the term of the equity award. Estimated volatility is based on the historical
volatility of the Company s common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect
at the time of grant. The fair market value of common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of the Company s
common stock.  

The
Company recognizes the fair value of stock-based compensation awards in general and administrative costs and in research and development
costs, as appropriate, in the Company s statement of operations. The Company issues new shares of common stock to satisfy
stock option exercises.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes under an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes.
Accordingly, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected impact of differences between the financial
statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.  

The
Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.
In the event the Company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of
its recorded amount, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be credited to operations in the period such determination
was made. Likewise, should the Company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in
the future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to operations in the period such determination was made.  

Plan
of Operation   

General
Overview of Plans   

The
Company s original focus was the development of new treatments for the most common and most aggressive type of brain cancer
of adults, glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ), and the most common cancer of children, neuroblastoma. The Company has
expanded the scope of its anti-cancer investigational activities to include the most common brain tumor of children, medulloblastoma,
and also to several other types of more common cancers. This expansion of activity is based on documentation that each of two
distinct types of drugs being developed by the Company has activity against cell lines of breast, colon, lung, prostate, pancreas,
ovary, stomach and liver cancer, as well as against the major types of leukemias. LB-100 has now been shown to have activity in
animal models of brain tumors of adults and children, and also against melanomas and sarcomas. Studies in animal models of human
melanoma, lymphoma, sarcoma, brain tumors, and the rare neuroendocrine cancer, pheochromocytoma, have demonstrated marked potentiation
by LB-100 of the anti-tumor activity of the widely used standard chemotherapeutic drugs. These studies confirm that the LB-100
compounds, in combination with any of several standard anti-cancer drugs, have broad activity affecting many different cell types
of cancer.  

The
Company s immediate focus has been to determine the safety and appropriate dose of LB-100 when used alone and in combination
with widely used anti-cancer drugs in its Phase 1 clinical trial. The Company s longer-term objective is to secure one or
more strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical companies with major programs in cancer, vascular disease and/or neurologic disease.  

The
significant diversity of the potential therapeutic value of the Company s Series 2 compounds (LB-201 and homologs) stems
from the fact that these agents modify critical pathways in cancer cells and in microorganisms such as fungi, and appear to ameliorate
pathologic processes that lead to brain injury caused by trauma or toxins or through as yet unknown mechanisms that underlie the
major chronic neurologic diseases, including Alzheimer s disease, Parkinson s disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
(ALS, or Lou Gehrig s disease).  

Operating
Plans    

The
Company s primary focus is developing new treatments for human cancers for which better therapies are urgently needed. The
scope of potential applications of the Company s products has expanded to other common non-malignant diseases, including
vascular diseases (heart attacks and stroke), diabetes, genetic diseases, such as Gaucher s disease, and recently to depression
and potentially post-traumatic stress syndrome. This has occurred because the targets selected by the Company have multiple functions
in the cell, which, when altered, result in different disorders that may benefit by treatment from the Company s products.  

The
Company s drug discovery process is based on discerning clues to potential new targets for disease treatments reported in
the increasingly large body of literature identifying the molecular variants which characterize human cancers and other non-cancer
disorders. The Company designs drugs for which there are existing data suggesting that they may affect the altered pathways of
the cancer cell and may be given safely to humans. The Company seeks to rapidly arrive at patentable structures through analysis
of the literature rather than screening of thousands of structures for activity against a particular biochemical pathway.  

This
approach has led to the development of two classes of drugs for the treatment of cancer, consisting of protein phosphatase inhibitors
(PTase-i), designated by the Company as the LB-100 series of compounds, and histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), designated
by the Company as the LB-200 series of compounds. Compounds of both types also have potential use in the prevention and treatment
of neurodegenerative diseases.  

The
LB-100 series consists of novel structures, which have the potential to be first in their class, and may be useful in the treatment
of not only several types of cancer but also vascular and metabolic diseases. The LB-200 series contains compounds which have
the potential to be the most effective in its class and may be useful for the treatment of chronic hereditary diseases, such as
Gaucher s disease, in addition to cancer and neurodegenerative diseases.  

The
Company has demonstrated that lead compounds of both series of drugs are active against a broad spectrum of human cancers in cell
culture and against several types of human cancers in animal models. The research on new drug treatment was initiated in 2006
with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ( NINDS ) of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH )
under a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement ( CRADA ) effective March 22, 2006. The research at NINDS was
led by Dr. Zhengping Zhuang, an internationally recognized investigator in the molecular pathology of cancer. The initial focus
of the CRADA was on the most common and uniformly fatal brain tumor of adults, GBM. The work at NIH was then extended to the most
common brain tumor of children, medulloblastoma, and to the most common extracranial solid tumor of children, neuroblastoma. The
CRADA was extended through a series of amendments and remained in effect until April 1, 2013, when it terminated as scheduled.  

Effective
October 18, 2013, the Company entered into a Materials Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (M-CRADA) with the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke of the National Institutes of Health (NINDS, NIH) for a term of four years. The
Surgical Neurology Branch of NINDS, NIH will conduct research characterizing a variety of compounds proprietary to the Company,
and will examine the compounds  potential for anti-cancer activity, reducing neurological deficit due to ischemia and brain
injury, and stabilizing catalytic function of misfolded proteins for inborn brain diseases. Under an M-CRADA, a party provides
research material, in this case proprietary compounds from the Company s pipeline, for study by scientists at NIH. The exchange
of material is for research only and implies no endorsement of the material on the part of either party. Under the M-CRADA the
NIH grants a collaborator an exclusive option to elect an exclusive or non-exclusive commercialization license. The M-CRADA does
not generate any incremental cost to the Company.  

Effective
treatment of brain tumors depends upon the ability of compounds to penetrate a physiological barrier known as the  blood-brain
barrier , which protects the brain from exposure to potentially toxic substances in the blood. Because there is no certainty
that the Company s compounds will be active against tumors confined to the brain, the LB-100 compounds have been studied
against a variety of common and rare cancer types and have been shown to potentiate the activity of standard anti-cancer drugs
in animal models of breast and pancreatic cancer, melanoma, pheochromcytomas and sarcomas. Because the LB-100 compounds appear
to exert their ability to improve the effectiveness of different forms of chemotherapy and radiation therapy by inhibiting a process
upon which most, if not all, cancer cell types depend on to survive treatment, the Company believes the LB-100 series of compounds
may be useful against most, if not all, cancer types.  

The
second class of drugs under development by the Company, referred to as LB-200, is the histone deacetylase inhibitors. Many pharmaceutical
companies are also developing drugs of this type, and at least two companies have HDACi approved for clinical use, in both cases
for the treatment of a type of lymphoma. Despite this significant competition, the Company has demonstrated that its HDACi has
broad activity against many cancer types, has neuroprotective activity, and has anti-fungal activity. In addition, these compounds
have low toxicity, making them attractive candidates for development. It appears that one type of molecule has diverse effects,
affecting biochemical processes that are fundamental to the life of the cell, whether they are cancer cells, nerve cells, or even
fungal cells. The neuroprotective activity of the Company s HDACi has been demonstrated in the test tube in model systems
that mimic injury to brain cells, such as occurs in stroke and Alzheimer s disease. This type of protective activity may
have potential application to a broad spectrum of other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson s disease
and Amytrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig s disease).  

The
Company s primary objective has been to bring one lead compound of the LB-100 series to clinical trial. In 2012, the Company
completed the pre-clinical studies required to prepare an Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application to the FDA
to conduct a Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100, and engaged Theradex Systems, Inc. ( Theradex ), an international contract
research organization ( CRO ) that provides professional services for the clinical research and development of pharmaceutical
compounds, to be responsible for the clinical development of the Company s lead anti-cancer compound LB-100 and to prepare
an IND application for filing with the FDA.  

The
Company filed an IND application with the FDA on April 30, 2012, and on July 24, 2012, the FDA notified the Company that it would
allow initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100. The purpose of this clinical trial was to demonstrate that LB-100 can
be administered safely to human beings at a dose and at a frequency that achieves the desired pharmacologic effect; in this case,
inhibition of a specific enzyme, without being associated with toxicities considered unacceptable. The Phase 1 clinical trial
of LB-100 was designed to be conducted in two parts. In Part 1, the maximum tolerable dose ( MTD ) of LB-100 was to
be determined. In Part 2, the MTD of LB-100, in combination with the standard cytotoxic drug docetaxel (which is a well-established
anti-mitotic chemotherapy medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of various cancers), was to be determined.  

The
Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 began in April 2013 with the entry of patients into the clinical trial initiated at the City
of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California, and was extended in December 2013 to include the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota, both of which are Comprehensive Cancer Centers designated by the National Cancer Institute. As the accrual of patients
was slower than anticipated, in October 2014, the Company entered into a Clinical Research Agreement ( CRA ) with
US Oncology Research, LLC, a large community-based research network based in Texas, to increase the rate of entry of patients
into the clinical trial by adding four more active clinical oncologic research sites.  

The
costs of Part 1 of the Phase 1 clinical trial exceeded the Company s original estimates, in part because patients were able
to tolerate higher doses of LB-100 than originally expected, thus requiring more dose escalation steps to determine the MTD of
LB-100 given alone. In addition, patients achieved stabilization without any dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) and remained
on treatment with LB-100 for longer periods of time than was usual in a Phase 1 clinical trial of a new drug in patients failing
all previous treatments, thus increasing the overall cost of the clinical trial. The Company s interpretation of the clinical
trial results to date is that LB-100 as a single agent has activity against several types of cancer, as evidenced by stabilization
of progressive disease in the absence of DLT.  

As
a prelude to determining the therapeutic effectiveness of LB-100 in a subsequent Phase 2 clinical trial of common cancers, a key
goal of Part 1 of the Phase 1 clinical trial was to demonstrate that the target enzyme of LB-100, protein phosphatase 2A ( PP2A ),
can be inhibited in humans with readily tolerable toxicity. As the patient accrual goal was reached in April 2016, Part 1 of the
Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 was closed to further patient enrollment at that time, and the MTD of LB-100 administered for
three consecutive days every three weeks was determined. All patients completed treatment with LB-100 and were off study by the
end of May 2016. The Company is now working with Theradex to complete the analysis of the clinical data, reconcile and pay the
remaining costs owed to the participating clinical sites, and prepare and submit the required Clinical Study Report to the FDA
on the completed Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100.  

As
an anti-cancer drug, LB-100 is likely to be used at MTD in Phase 2 clinical trials. For the potential treatment of non-malignant
diseases, such as acute vascular diseases and metabolic diseases, however, lower doses may achieve therapeutic benefit by inhibition
of the target enzyme, PP2A, thus opening up the possibility of a host of therapeutic applications for LB-100 and related proprietary
compounds.  

The
costs of the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 are being paid to or through Theradex, the CRO responsible for the clinical development
of LB-100. Total costs charged to operations through September 30, 2016 for services paid to or through Theradex pursuant to this
arrangement, which were first incurred in 2013, aggregated $2,040,867.  

The
Company had planned to proceed with Part 2 of the Phase 1 clinical trial to determine the toxicity of LB-100 in combination with
docetaxel against a specific solid tumor for which single agent docetaxel is indicated. However, two developments have altered
this plan. First, LB-100 appears to have anti-cancer activity in its own right, and second, preclinical studies indicate that
LB-100 in combination with cisplatin or doxorubicin (widely used cytotoxic drugs) is more active than LB-100 in combination with
docetaxel. LB-100 significantly potentiates the standard anti-cancer drugs cisplatin and doxorubicin in animal models of several
tumor types, including hepatocellular cancer and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. It has also been reported that inhibition
of the enzyme-target of LB-100, PP2A, inhibits certain variants of the hematologic disorder known as myelodysplastic syndrome
( MDS ). Accordingly, the Company decided not to proceed with Part 2 of the Phase 1 clinical trial, and has initiated
preliminary planning for Phase1b/2 clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of LB-100 alone for the treatment of MDS and
in combination with doxorubicin for the treatment of advanced hepatocellular cancer. This clinical trial will be initiated in
Taiwan under the December 2015 license agreement entered into with Taipei Medical University, and is expected to commence during
the first quarter of 2017. In addition, subject to the availability of additional capital, the Company will consider conducting
a Phase 1b/2 clinical trial of LB-100 in the hematologic disorder known as myelodysplastic syndrome and a Phase 1b/2 clinical
trial of LB-100 in combination with a platinum compound in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer, in 2017.  

The
Company estimates that Part 1 of the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100, patient enrollment for which was closed in May 2016, will
cost a total of approximately $2,200,000. The following factors have contributed to the most recent revisions to the total cost
and the delay in the completion date of this clinical trial: (1) some patients are continuing to receive the study compound longer
than is usual for patients with treatment-refractory progressive disease in a Phase 1 clinical trial; (2) the establishment of
the MTD required more subjects than the initially planned six patients; and (3) the planned pharmacokinetic studies required more
than the initially planned three patients.  

As
a compound moves through the FDA approval process, it becomes an increasingly valuable property, but at a cost of additional investment
at each stage. As the potential effectiveness of LB-100 has been documented at the clinical trial level, the Company has allocated
resources to expand the depth and extent of its patent portfolio. The Company s approach has been to operate with a minimum
of overhead, moving compounds forward as efficiently and inexpensively as possible, and to raise funds to support each of these
stages as certain milestones are reached.

pre-clinical research focused on the development of additional novel anti-cancer compounds to add to its clinical pipeline.  

As
the patient accrual goal was reached in April 2016, the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100 was closed to further patient enrollment
at that time. All patients completed treatment with LB-100 and were off study by the end of May 2016. The Company estimates that
it will continue to incur costs through December 2016 to complete the analysis of the clinical data, reconcile and pay the remaining
costs owed to the participating clinical sites, and prepare and submit the required Clinical Study Report to the FDA on the completed
Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   September 30, 2016   

The
Company s condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which
contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has not generated
any sustainable revenues from operations to date, and does not expect to do so in the foreseeable future. The Company has experienced
recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and has financed its working capital requirements
during this period primarily through the recurring sale of its equity securities and the exercise of outstanding warrants. As
a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.
In addition, the Company s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company s consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, has expressed substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern (see  Going Concern  above).  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $737,984 (including advances on research and development contract services
of $192,220), as compared to working capital of $312,333 at December 31, 2015 (including a licensing fee receivable of $200,000
and advances on research and development contract services of $207,677), an increase in working capital of $425,651 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in working capital during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily
the result of the receipt of $1,750,000 of proceeds from the sale of additional shares of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and money market funds aggregating $669,771, as compared to $129,376 at December 31,
2015, an increase of $540,395 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company expects
to receive a refund of advances made to or through Theradex Systems, Inc. of $181,510 upon the administrative closure of the Phase
1 clinical trial of LB-100.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company believes that it has sufficient resources to complete the analysis of the clinical data, reconcile
and pay the remaining costs owed to the participating clinical sites, and prepare and submit the required Clinical Study Report
to the FDA on the completed Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100, as well as to fund the Company s ongoing operating expenses,
including maintaining its patent portfolio, through at least March 2017.  

The
amount and timing of future cash requirements depend on the pace and design of the Company s clinical trial program. As
market conditions present uncertainty as to the Company s ability to secure additional funds, there can be no assurances
that the Company will be able to secure additional financing on acceptable terms, or at all, as and when necessary to continue
to conduct operations. If cash resources are insufficient to satisfy the Company s ongoing cash requirements, the Company
would be required to scale back or discontinue its technology and product development programs and/or clinical trials, or obtain
funds, if available (although there can be no certainty), through strategic alliances that may require the Company to relinquish
rights to certain of its compounds, or to discontinue its operations entirely.  

Operating
Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, operating activities utilized cash of $1,207,605, as compared to
utilizing cash of $1,568,858 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, to fund the Company s Phase 1 clinical trial
of LB-100, to support its other ongoing research and development activities, and to fund its other ongoing operating expenses,
including maintaining its patent portfolio.  

Investing
Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, investing activities consisted of a decrease in money market funds
of $104,095, due to the liquidation of such funds and the transfer of such amounts to cash. For the nine months ended September
30, 2015, investing activities consisted of an increase in money market funds of $310,388, due primarily to the investment in
money market funds of a portion of the proceeds from the sale of shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred
Stock in March 2015.  

Financing
Activities . For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, financing activities consisted of the receipt of $1,750,000 of proceeds
from the sale of 175,000 shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at $10.00 per share in January 2016,
less a dividend paid on the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock of $2,000. For the nine months ended September
30, 2015, financing activities consisted of $315,000 from the exercise of common stock warrants and $1,750,000 of proceeds received
from the sale of 175,000 shares of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock at $10.00 per share in March 2015,
less costs of $12,608 associated with the sale of the Company s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock.  

Principal
Commitments   

On
September 21, 2012, the Company entered into a work order agreement with Theradex, the CRO responsible for the clinical development
of the Company s lead anti-cancer compound LB-100, to manage and administer the Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100. The Phase
1 clinical trial of LB-100, which began during April 2013 with the entry of patients into the clinical trial, was carried out
by nationally recognized comprehensive cancer centers. As the patient accrual goal was reached in April 2016, the clinical trial
was closed to further patient enrollment at that time. All patients completed treatment with LB-100 and were off study by the
end of May 2016. The Company estimates that it will continue to incur costs through December 2016 to complete the analysis of
the clinical data, reconcile and pay the remaining costs owed to the participating clinical sites, and prepare and submit the
required Clinical Study Report to the FDA on the completed Phase 1 clinical trial of LB-100.  

The
Phase 1 clinical trial was estimated to cost a total of approximately $2,200,000, with such payments expected to be allocated
approximately 60% for services provided by Theradex and approximately 40% for pass-through costs for clinical center laboratory
costs and investigator costs over the life of the clinical trial. Total costs charged to operations through September 30, 2016
for services paid to or through Theradex pursuant to this arrangement, which were first incurred in 2013, aggregated $2,040,867.  

On
December 24, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with NDA Consulting Corp. ( NDA ) for consultation and advice
in the field of oncology research and drug development. As part of the agreement, NDA also agreed to cause its president, Dr.
Daniel D. Von Hoff, M.D., to become a member of the Company s Scientific Advisory Committee. The term of the agreement was
for one year and provided for a quarterly cash fee of $4,000. The agreement was automatically renewed on its anniversary date
for an additional one-year term. Consulting and advisory fees charged to operations pursuant to this agreement were $4,000 during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $12,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Effective
January 1, 2014, the Company entered into an Advisory Agreement with Dr. Kathleen P. Mullinix, a member of the Board of Directors
of the Company, effective for an initial term of one year through December 31, 2014 to advise on business development matters.
The Advisory Agreement provided for annual cash compensation of $25,000. The term of the Advisory Agreement was automatically
extended for a term of one year annually unless a notice of intent to terminate was given by either party at least 90 days before
the end of the applicable term. Accordingly, the Advisory Agreement was extended for additional terms of one year effective January
1, 2015 and 2016. The Company recognized a charge to operations of $6,250 as consulting and advisory fees pursuant to this Advisory
Agreement during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $18,750 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015.  

On
October 7, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with ProActive Capital Resources Group LLC for strategic advisory, investor
relations and public relations services through October 6, 2015. Among other things, the agreement provided for compensation in
the form of a monthly cash fee of $1,500. The Company recorded a charge to operations pursuant to this agreement of $4,500 and
$13,500 for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

Effective
September 14, 2015, the Company entered into a Collaboration Agreement with BioPharmaWorks, pursuant to which the Company engaged
BioPharmaWorks to perform certain services for the Company. Those services include, among other things: (a) assisting the Company
to (i) commercialize its products and strengthen its patent portfolio, (ii) identify large pharmaceutical companies with potential
interest in the Company s product pipeline, and (iii) prepare and deliver presentations concerning the Company s products;
(b) at the request of the Board of Directors, serving as backup management for up to three months should the Company s Chief
Executive Officer and scientific leader be temporarily unable to carry out his duties; (c) being available for consultation in
drug discovery and development; and (d) identifying providers and overseeing tasks relating to clinical use and commercialization
of new compounds. BioPharmaWorks was founded in 2015 by former Pfizer scientists with extensive multi-disciplinary research and
development and drug development experience. The Collaboration Agreement is for an initial term of two years and automatically
renews for subsequent annual periods unless terminated by a party not less than 60 days prior to the expiration of the applicable
period. In connection with the Collaboration Agreement, the Company agreed to pay BioPharmaWorks a monthly fee of $10,000, subject
to the right of the Company to pay a negotiated hourly rate in lieu of the monthly payment, and agreed to issue to BioPharmaWorks
certain equity-based compensation as described at Note 8. The Company recorded a charge to operations pursuant to this Collaboration
Agreement of $30,000 and $90,000 during the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

The
Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, consisting of its principal
executive officer and principal financial officer (who is the same person), of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act (defined below)). Based upon that evaluation,
the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered
in this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and is accumulated and communicated to the Company s
management, consisting of the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure.  

The
Company s management, consisting of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that
its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls will prevent all error or fraud. A control system, no matter how
well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are
met. Furthermore, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of
controls must be considered relative to their costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of
controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. In addition,
as conditions change over time, so too may the effectiveness of internal controls. However, management believes that the financial
statements included in this report fairly present, in all material respects, the Company s financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting  

The
Company s management, consisting of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has determined that
no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13(a)-15(f) and 15(d)-15(f)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) occurred during or subsequent to the end of the period covered in this report that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM
1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

The
Company is not currently subject to any pending or threatened legal actions or claims.  

ITEM
1A. RISK FACTORS   

As
of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 28, 2016 (the  2015 Form 10-K ).
The Risk Factors set forth in the 2015 Form 10-K should be read carefully in connection with evaluating the Company s business
and in connection with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Any of the risks described
in the 2015 Form 10-K could materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition or future results and
the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made. These are not the only risks that the Company faces.
Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems to be immaterial also
may materially adversely affect the Company s business, financial condition and/or operating results.  

ITEM
2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS    

Effective
September 12, 2016, in connection with his continuing role as a consultant to the Company, Francis Johnson was granted fully-vested
stock options under the 2007 Plan to purchase 500,000 shares of the Company s common stock. The stock options are exercisable
for a period of five years from the date of grant at $0.20 per share. The fair market value of the Company s common stock
on the date of grant was $0.20 per share. The fair value of these stock options, as calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model, was determined to be $98,901 ($0.1978 per share).
