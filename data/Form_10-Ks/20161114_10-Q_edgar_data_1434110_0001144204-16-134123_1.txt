  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1      ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES   

a)    Basis of Presentation  

The accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP )
for interim financial information with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these unaudited
condensed financial statements do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial
statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements include all adjustments (consisting
only of normal recurring adjustments), which we consider necessary, for a fair presentation of those financial statements. The
results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 may not necessarily be indicative of
results that may be expected for any succeeding quarter or for the entire fiscal year. The information contained in this quarterly
report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements included in our annual report on Form 10-K
as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). 

Significant accounting policies are
described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our annual report on Form 10-K as of December
31, 2015. 

The preparation of unaudited consolidated
financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions, which are evaluated on
an ongoing basis, that affect the amounts reported in the unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of
revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results could differ from those estimates and judgments.
In particular, significant estimates and judgments include those related to: the estimated useful lives for plant and equipment,
the fair value of warrants and stock options granted for services or compensation, estimates of the probability and potential magnitude
of contingent liabilities, derivative liabilities, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets due to continuing operating
losses, those related to revenue recognition and the allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Making estimates requires management
to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation
or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements, which management considered
in formulating its estimate could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual
results could differ significantly from our estimates. 

All amounts referred to in the notes
to the unaudited consolidated financial statements are in United States Dollars ($) unless stated otherwise. 

b)    Principles of Consolidation  

The unaudited consolidated financial
statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries in which it has a majority voting interest. All
significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the unaudited consolidated financial statements. The
entities included in these unaudited consolidated financial statements are as follows: 

Propell Technologies Group, Inc.
  Parent Company 

 Novas Energy USA Inc. (wholly owned) 

 Novas Energy North America, LLC (60% owned)   Discontinued effective November 1, 2016. 

PROPELL TECHNOLOGIES GROUP, INC.  

  NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1      ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND
ESTIMATES (continued)   

c)    Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Measurement
of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  ASU 2016-13 will replace the current incurred loss approach with an expected loss
model for instruments measured at amortized cost and require entities to record allowances for available-for-sale debt securities
rather than reduce the carrying amount under the current other-than-temporary impairment model. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for all entities
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods therein. We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-13
will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification
of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions
are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and
interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-15 will
have on our consolidated statements of cash flows. 

In October 2016, Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. ( ASU ) 2016-16,  Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets
Other Than Inventory.  ASU 2016-16 requires immediate recognition of income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers,
other than inventory transfers.  Existing GAAP prohibits recognition of income tax consequences of intercompany asset transfers
whereby the seller defers any net tax effect and the buyer is prohibited from recognizing a deferred tax asset on the difference
between the newly created tax basis of the asset in its tax jurisdiction and its financial statement carrying amount as reported
in the consolidated financial statements.  ASU 2016-16 specifically excludes from its scope intercompany inventory transfers
whereby the recognition of tax consequences will take place when the inventory is sold to third parties. ASU 2016-16 is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted
as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements have not been issued or made available for issuance.
We are currently evaluating the effect ASU 2016-16 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

Any new accounting standards,
not disclosed above, that have been issued or proposed by FASB that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected
to have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption. 

d)      Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly
liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, the Company had no cash equivalents. 

The Company minimizes credit
risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality of its primary financial institution. The balance at times
may exceed federally insured limits. At September 30, 2016, the Company had cash balances of $9,519,445, which exceeded the federally
insured limits by $9,211,049. At December 31, 2015, the Company had cash balances of $11,700,143, which exceeded the federally
insured limits by $10,877,045.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

e)    Related parties  

Parties are considered to be related
to the Company if the parties that, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled by, or
are under common control with the Company, or own in aggregate, on a fully diluted basis 5% or more of the Company s stock.
Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management, members of the immediate families of principal owners
of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company may deal if one party controls or can significantly
influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the transacting parties might be prevented
from fully pursuing its own separate interests. The Company discloses all related party transactions. All transactions are recorded
at fair value of the goods or services exchanged. Property purchased from a related party is recorded at the cost to the related
party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is reflected as a distribution to related party. 

f)    Prior period comparatives  

The prior period comparative amounts
have been restated to give effect to the discontinued operation disclosed in note 2 below.

2      DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS   

On October 4, 2016, Novas Energy
USA, Inc. ( Novas USA ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, delivered a notice to Technovita Technologies USA,
Inc. ( Technovita ) electing to dissolve its joint venture with Technovita (the  Joint Venture ), effective
November 1, 2016, pursuant to Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement of Novas Energy North America, LLC ( NENA ),
dated October 22, 2015 (the  Operating Agreement ), by and among Novas USA and Technovita. 

Section 11.1(b) of the Operating
Agreement provides that the Joint Venture may be dissolved upon the election of Novas USA in the event the Joint Venture fails
to satisfy any Year 1 Key Performance Indicator by an amount greater than five percent (5%) of the applicable metric (the  Year
1 Milestone ). The Joint Venture has not achieved the Year 1 Milestone. For the purposes of the Operating Agreement, the
Year 1 Key Performance Indicators are defined as: during a continuous twelve (12) month period commencing upon September 1, 2015
each of: (1) sales from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (2) sales from activities in Canada
of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (3) EBITDA from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $524,000; and
(4) EBITDA from activities in Canada of greater than or equal to $524,000. Upon a dissolution, all intellectual property assets
of the Joint Venture, including any improvements to Technology (as defined in the Operating Agreement) is to be distributed to
Technovita solely for use in Canada, its territories and its possessions and Novas USA solely for use in the United States and
its territories. 

Pursuant to the Operating Agreement,
Novas USA had entered into a sublicense agreement (the  Novas Sublicense Agreement ) with NENA and Novas Energy Group
Limited for NENA to be the exclusive provider of Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in the
United States. The Sublicense Agreement was terminated upon termination of the Joint Venture. The Operating Agreement also provided,
among other things, that Novas USA would contribute an aggregate of $1,200,000 to the capital of the Joint Venture for its 60%
interest in the Joint Venture. Novas USA has contributed $900,000 to the Joint Venture to date and believes that it has valid defenses
to any claim that may be made that it contribute additional funds. 

The Company intends to work with
Technovita to dissolve the operations of the Joint Venture in a business-like manner and to continue to re-focus its business efforts
on becoming an oil exploitation and production ( E P ) company through the acquisition and growth of a base of
producing assets by leveraging M A and operational expertise, and by using advanced technology to increase their production.

On January 1, 2016, the  Company

the Company s Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Boutte will also serve as the Company s interim Chief Financial Officer.
Under the Boutte Employment Agreement, for his service as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Mr. Boutte receives an annual

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion and analysis
is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated.
 The discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto presented
herein and our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the other
information set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to historical information,
the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements
that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these forward-looking
statements as a result of many factors including those discussed herein below, under Part II, Item 1A,  Risk Factors 
and elsewhere herein, and those identified under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  

Overview and Financial Condition  

Our Company  

We intend to be an oil exploitation and
production ( E P ) company through the acquisition and growth of a base of producing assets by leveraging M A
and operational expertise, and by using advanced technology to increase their production. On July 6, 2015, we closed the final
tranche of our private placement of the sale of our Series C Preferred Stock and raised an additional $9,750,000, the use of proceeds
of which was specified to be for the acquisition, enhancement and maintenance of an oil field for the deployment of our technology.
To date we have not acquired any oil fields. Upon the closing of the private placement, we shifted our operational focus from being
a direct provider of well services based upon plasma pulse technology to actively seeking to acquire producing oil fields to generate
revenues and the development of untapped hydrocarbon reserves through resource conversion once oil supply/demand rebalances and
prices rebound. As a result, in August 2015, our board of directors and shareholders approved the exclusive sublicense to our majority
owned subsidiary Novas Energy North America, LLC ( NENA ) of our rights to use certain plasma pulse technology that
we had licensed from Novas Energy Group Limited (the  Licensor ) pursuant to the terms of an exclusive license agreement
(the  License Agreement ), for treatment of vertical wells in the United States (hereafter, the  Licensed Plasma
Pulse Technology ). We retained the right to use the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of our own assets located
in the United States as well as treatment of assets outside of the United States. The Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology refers to
the process and apparatus of Licensor for its plasma pulse technology as covered by Licensor s patent rights. Although we
were indirectly engaged in the oil recovery business through NENA and are directly through our treatment of oil wells in Mexico,
it is not now our foundational business strategy. 

On October 4, 2016, Novas Energy USA, Inc.
( Novas USA ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, delivered a notice to Technovita Technologies USA, Inc. ( Technovita )
electing to dissolve its joint venture with Technovita (the  Joint Venture ), effective November 1, 2016, pursuant
to Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement of Novas Energy North America, LLC ( NENA ), dated October 22, 2015 (the
 Operating Agreement ), by and among Novas USA and Technovita. 

Section 11.1(b) of the Operating Agreement
provides that the Joint Venture may be dissolved upon the election of Novas USA in the event the Joint Venture fails to satisfy
any Year 1 Key Performance Indicator by an amount greater than five percent (5%) of the applicable metric (the  Year 1 Milestone ).
The Joint Venture has not achieved the Year 1 Milestone. For the purposes of the Operating Agreement, the Year 1 Key Performance
Indicators are defined as: during a continuous twelve (12) month period commencing upon September 1, 2015 each of: (1) sales from
activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $2,829,000; (2) sales from activities in Canada of greater than or
equal to $2,829,000; (3) EBITDA from activities in the United States of greater than or equal to $524,000; and (4) EBITDA from
activities in Canada of greater than or equal to $524,000. Upon a dissolution, all intellectual property assets of the Joint Venture,
including any improvements to Technology (as defined in the Operating Agreement) is to be distributed to Technovita solely for
use in Canada, its territories and its possessions and Novas USA solely for use in the United States and its territories. 

Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, Novas
USA had entered into a sublicense agreement (the  Novas Sublicense Agreement ) with NENA and Novas Energy Group Limited
for NENA to be the exclusive provider of Plasma Pulse Technology for treatment of vertical wells to third parties in the United
States. The Sublicense Agreement was terminated upon termination of the Joint Venture. The Operating Agreement also provided, among
other things, that Novas USA would contribute an aggregate of $1,200,000 to the capital of the Joint Venture for its 60% interest
in the Joint Venture. Novas USA has contributed $900,000 to the Joint Venture to date and believes that it has valid defenses to
any claim that may be made that it contribute additional funds. 

The Company intends to work with Technovita
to dissolve the operations of the Joint Venture in a business-like manner and to continue to re-focus its business efforts on becoming
an oil exploitation and production ( E P ) company through the acquisition and growth of a base of producing assets
by leveraging M A and operational expertise, and by using advanced technology to increase their production. 

1   

On July 19, 2016, we received a notice
from Licensor purporting to effectively terminate the License Agreement for non-payment of required royalties, asserting, among
other things, that as of June 30, 2016, Novas owed Licensor a   pro rata   amount of $1,458,333 for the Licensed Plasma
Pulse Technology for the United States and Mexico, of which $1,000,000 was alleged to be in arrears. Licensor has since reiterated
its demands, particularly as to its demands related to Mexico. We and Novas believe that there is no legal basis for Licensor
to terminate the License Agreement and intend to vigorously defend against any attempt by Licensor to enforce a termination of
the License Agreement. Further, we believe that Licensor has failed to materially perform its obligations under the License Agreement,
and we believe that such failures on Licensor s part may impact what, if any, payments are due under the License Agreement
by Novas to Licensor. 

We believe that it is evident from the
plain language of the Sublicense Agreement, and the fact that we transferred to NENA substantially all of its rights for the use
of Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States of America, that the Sublicense Agreement replaced and superseded the
royalty fees due under the License Agreement for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the Licensed Territory. We
also believe that we have developed our own plasma-pulse technology not based on or otherwise an infringement to, the Licensed
Plasma Pulse Technology, although the Licensor has not accepted our claim. Going forward, our intent is to deploy our own plasma-pulse
technology in lieu of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, however, if we were to seek to continue to use the Licensed Plasma
Pulse Technology, by reason of the termination of the Sublicense Agreement, effective November 1, 2016, we would be required to
pay royalties to Licensor. 

In 2013, we closed a Share Exchange Agreement
with the shareholders of Novas, under which we acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Novas in exchange for 100,000,000
shares of our common stock. Novas had entered into a license for use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology licensed from Licensor
for use in the United States and Mexico. Prior to the closing of the second tranche of the Series C Preferred Stock private placement
and the sublicense with NENA, our focus had been on the provision of production enhancement services. We have not concluded any
further agreements under this joint venture model other than in Mexico where we have begun a program to treat 15 wells for Pemex,
Mexico's state-owned petroleum company (Petr leos Mexicanos), utilizing a plasma pulse technology, through our partner in
Mexico, Pozotech/Grupo Industrial RJP. We anticipate deriving approximately $375,000 in revenue from the treatment of the 15 wells. 

To date, we derived $545,522 in revenue
from our oil enhancement business. We have financed our operations primarily from sales of our securities, both debt and equity,
and to a lesser extent revenue from operations and we expect to continue to obtain required capital in a similar manner. We have
incurred an accumulated deficit of $17,024,365 through September 30, 2016 and there can be no assurance that we will be able to
achieve profitability. 

Management Discussion and Analysis
of financial condition   

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated
financial statement as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
disclosure of any contingent liabilities at the financial statement date and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. On an on-going basis, we review our estimates and assumptions. Our estimates are based on our historical experience
and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results are likely to differ from those
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

2   

Results of Operations for the three months ended September
30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  

Net revenues  

Net revenues were $Nil for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All of the revenue during the quarter is reported under discontinued operations. Effective November
1,2016 we discontinued our NENA joint venture, in which we have a 60% share. We have not received any revenue from our current
operations in Mexico. 

Cost of goods sold  

 Cost of goods sold was $Nil and $40,275
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $40,275 or 100.0%. In the prior period the
cost of sales consisted primarily of engineering services provided by third party contractors. 

Gross loss  

 Gross loss was $Nil and $(40,275)
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $40,275, primarily due to engineering costs
incurred in the prior period on wells treated for no revenues. 

Total expenses  

 Total expenses were $512,708 and $769,660
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $256,952 or 33.4%. Total expenses consisted
primarily of the following: 

Other income  

 Other income was $4,059 and $Nil for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the other income
during the current period represents a reimbursement for travel expenditure incurred on our Mexican project. 

Net loss from continuing operations  

 We incurred a net loss from continuing
operations of $508,649 and $809,989, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $301,340
or 37.2%, which consists primarily of the reduction in cost of sales and total expenses discussed above. 

3   

Loss from discontinued operations, net
of tax  

 The increase in the loss from discontinued operations of $363,421 and $221,423 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $141,998 or 64.1% is primarily due to the joint venture only operating
for one month in the prior period as opposed to three months in the current period. Due to the inability of the Joint Venture to
meet its operating milestones, the joint Venture is being dissolved in terms of the operating agreement. 

Net loss attributable to non-controlling
interest of discontinued operations  

 The net loss attributable to non-controlling
interest of discontinued operations of $nil and $88,569 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a
decrease of $88,569 or 100.0% is due to the non-controlling interest equity being fully depleted during the first quarter of the
current period. 

Net loss attributable to controlling
interest  

 The decrease in net loss attributable to controlling interest of $872,070 and $942,843 for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is primarily due to the reduction in cost of sales and total expenses, discussed
above, offset by increased discontinued operations losses incurred during the three months, discussed above. 

Undeclared Series B and Series C preferred
stock dividends  

 A deemed preferred stock dividend of $157,786
has been disclosed for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This amount represents the dividends that are due, but
remain undeclared, to Series B and Series C preferred stock holders for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Results of Operations for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  

Net revenues  

 Net revenues were $Nil and $91,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, a decrease of $91,000 or 100.0%. All of the revenue during the
nine months is reported under discontinued operations. We discontinued our NENA joint venture, in which we have a 60% share, with
effect from November 1, 2016. In the prior period, we had derived revenue from the treatment of well by Novas, our wholly owned
subsidiary. Due to the current market conditions in the oil industry, our ability to generate significant revenues remains very
limited and we have not acquired any oil producing assets in terms of our business strategy. 

Cost of goods sold  

 Cost of goods sold was $Nil and $140,245 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
a decrease of $140,245 or 100.0%. Cost of goods sold during the current period is reported under discontinued operations. We discontinued
our NENA joint venture, in which we have a 60% share, with effect from November 1, 2016. In the prior period the cost of sales
consisted primarily of engineering services provided by third party contractors. 

Gross loss  

 Gross loss was $Nil and $(49,245) for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $49,245, primarily due to the lack of revenues in the current period as all revenue generating activities are reported under discontinued operations. 

Total expenses  

 Total expenses were $1,655,369 and $2,216,966
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $561,597 or 25.3%. Total expenses consisted
primarily of the following: 

General and administrative expenditure was $894,807 and $1,224,400 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $329,593 or 26.9%. This decrease is primarily due to the following; i) a decrease
in stock based compensation expense of $727,821 primarily due to a prior charge for restricted stock awarded to our former Chief
Executive Officer, John Huemoeller and one of our directors, John Zotos, which was fully amortized as of December 31, 2015; offset
by ii) an increase in payroll expenses of $316,621, including benefits expenditure, due to the employment of our new CEO in January
2016 and a COO in March 2016, previously we did not have a COO function; iii) a decrease in travel expenditure of $50,182 due to
lower business activity; and iv) a decrease in rental expenditure of $33,021 primarily due to relocating the business to cheaper
premises and the cancellation of an apartment lease which was occupied by our former CEO. 

4   

Other income  

 Other income was $203,296 and $Nil for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $203,296 was primarily due to the forgiveness of
the once off license fee for the Mexican market of $200,000, which was due in June 2015. 

Amortization of debt discount and finance
costs  

 Amortization of debt discount and finance
costs was $Nil and $53,154 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. All debt was repaid during the
first quarter of the prior period, all interest due was repaid and the remaining debt discount was fully amortized. 

Change in fair value of derivatives  

 The change in fair value of
derivative liabilities was $Nil and $18,455 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, a decrease of
$18,455. In the prior period the derivative liability movement reflected the mark-to-market of equities issued to short-term
note holders who converted their debt to equity at deeply discounted prices based on variable priced conversion rates which
was offset by a mark-to-market credits on the remaining short-term convertible notes. 

Net loss from continuing operations  

 We incurred a net loss from continuing
operations of $1,452,073 and $2,300,910, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, a decrease of $848,837
or 36.9%, which consists primarily of the reduction in total expenses and the forgiveness of the license fee discussed above. 

Loss from discontinued operations, net
of tax  

 The increase in loss from discontinued
operations of $1,428,157 and $221,423 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of $1,206,734
or 545.0% is primarily due to the joint venture only operating for one month in the prior period as opposed to nine months in the
current period. Due to the inability of the Joint Venture to meet its operating milestones, the Joint Venture is being dissolved
in terms of the operating agreement. 

Net loss attributable to non-controlling
interest of discontinued operations  

 The net loss attributable to non-controlling
interest of discontinued operations of $249,339 and $88,569 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
an increase of $160,770 or 181.5% is due to the losses in the Joint Venture being shares as to 40% by the non-controlling party
until the full value of their investment was depleted. 

Net loss attributable to controlling
interest  

 The increase in net loss attributable
to controlling interest of $2,630,891 and $2,433,764 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, is primarily
due to the reduction in total expenses, the forgiveness of the license fees due, offset by the operating losses incurred by the
Joint Venture, as discussed above.  

Deemed preferred stock dividend  

 A deemed preferred stock dividend of $Nil
and $2,456,781 has been disclosed in the statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
This amount represents the in-the-money value of the conversion feature of the Series C Preferred Stock as of the date of issue.
These shares of Series C Preferred Stock are convertible into common stock at an exercise price of $0.12291665 per share. 

Undeclared Series B and Series C preferred
stock dividends  

 A deemed preferred stock dividend of
$469,928 and $302,948 has been disclosed for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. This amount represents the
dividends that are due, but remain undeclared, to Series B and Series C preferred stock holders for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Net loss available to common stockholders  

 We incurred a net loss of $3,100,819 and
$5,193,493 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, a decrease of $2,092,674 or 40.2%, respectively and which consists
of the various items discussed above.

Liquidity and Capital Resources . 

 To date, our primary sources of cash have
been funds raised from the sale of our securities and the issuance of convertible and non-convertible debt. No additional funds
were raised during the current financial period. 

We have spent $200,899 on plant and equipment
for continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily on new down hole tools acquired. 

We have incurred an accumulated deficit
of $17,024,365 through September 30, 2016 and incurred negative cash flow from operations of $1,497,207 on continuing operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We have spent, and need to continue to spend, substantial amounts in connection with
implementing our new business strategy. 

Our primary commitments include the minimum
commitments under the license agreements. We do not anticipate investing the additional $300,000 into the joint venture which we
had originally committed. Based upon our current plans, we believe that our cash will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated
operating needs for at least the next twelve months, subject to any property acquisition. 

Our minimum commitments under the License
Agreement for the next five years (assuming the License Agreement and the Novas Sublicense Agreement remain in effect and the $500,000
annual royalty payment with respect to the United States territory is not required to be paid), is summarized as follows:

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

(a)     Evaluation of disclosure
controls and procedures   
  
 Pursuant to Rule 13a-15(b) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act ), the Company carried out an evaluation, with the participation
of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ), who also serves as
our principal financial and accounting officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined under Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation,
the Company s CEO who also serves as our principal financial and accounting officer concluded that due to a lack of segregation
of duties and insufficient controls over review and accounting for certain complex transactions, that the Company s disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016 were not effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act, was recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to the Company s management, including the Company s CEO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. The Company intends to retain additional individuals to remedy the ineffective controls. We have begun to take actions
that we believe will substantially remediate the material weaknesses identified. In response to the identification of our material
weaknesses, we are in the process of expanding our finance and accounting staff. However, we cannot assure you that our internal
control over financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. 

(b)     Changes in Internal Control
over Financial Reporting   
  
 There has been no change in
our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during
our fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

Risks Relating to Our Company  

We intend to become an exploitation and production
stage company .  

We intend to use the proceeds from the
sale of our Series C Preferred Stock to acquire oil fields and intend to become an exploitation and production stage company which
will face a high risk of business failure because of the unique difficulties and uncertainties inherent in oil and gas exploitation
ventures. Potential investors should be aware of the risks and uncertainties normally encountered by oil and gas companies and
the high rate of failure of such companies. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the problems, expenses,
difficulties, complications and delays that could be encountered in connection with our planned exploitation and followed drilling.
These potential problems include, but are not limited to, possible problems relating to exploitation and additional costs and expenses
that may reduce our current forecast of income and asset value. Additional expenditures related to exploitation may not result
in the confirmation of anticipated oil and gas reserves. Problems such as unusual or unexpected formations and other conditions
are involved in mineral development and often result in unsuccessful efforts. The acquisition of additional fields will be dependent
upon us possessing capital resources at that time in order to purchase and/or maintain such concessions. If no funding is available,
we may be forced to cease our exploitation activities. 

To date, we have not successfully acquired
any fields and have limited funding from which to do so. Our acquisition of a field is dependent upon market conditions and pricing.
The competition for the acquisition of fields is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire a suitable
field with our existing resources. 

Our business is difficult to evaluate
because we are currently focused on a new line of business and a new business strategy and have very limited operating history
and limited information.   

In 2015, we switched our business model
with our entry into a Joint Venture Agreement with Technovita and announced that we were seeking to acquire oil wells and use a
plasma pulse technology on our acquired oil wells. To date we have not acquired any wells and all of our revenue, although minimal,
has been derived from operations under the Joint Venture Agreement. Effective November 1, 2016, we terminated the Joint Venture
Agreement. To date, the joint venture has generated minimal revenue. We are currently servicing customers in Mexico with a plasma
pulse technology and intend to continue to utilize plasma pulse technology on our own assets as well as third party assets. Our
revenue and income potential is unproven and our business model is continually evolving. We are subject to the risks inherent to
the operation of a new business enterprise, and cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully address these risks. 

7   

We currently have limited revenues
and may not generate any revenue in the near future, if at all, from the use of our technology.   

We currently have not acquired any wells
and therefore we have generated no revenue from the operation of oil wells and we have generated limited revenues from the use
of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology. To date, we have derived limited revenue from the joint venture and we have not derived
any revenue from the provision of our services in Mexico . During the first nine months of 2016, the joint venture has treated
four wells using our down-hole tools. The majority of the wells that were treated were treated as sample wells to demonstrate
the ability of plasma pulse technology at no cost to the well owner. Therefore, there can be no assurance that there will be any
revenue form the operation of wells or from future customers of our services that utilize a plasma pulse technology.      

We may not be profitable.   

We expect to incur operating losses for
the foreseeable future. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, respectively,
we had net revenues of $Nil and $91,000 from our plasma pulse oil recovery business. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
we have sustained a net loss of $3,100,819 and for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we sustained a net loss of $4,331,980
and $5,018,483, respectively. To date, we have not acquired any oil wells, we have not generated significant revenue from the Licensed
Plasma Pulse Technology and NENA has not generated any significant revenues from the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology and we have
not generated revenue from our operations in Mexico. Our ability to become profitable depends on our ability to find acquisition
candidates, to have successful operations and generate and sustain sales, while maintaining reasonable expense levels, all of which
are uncertain in light of our limited operating history in our current line of business and our recent changes in business strategy. 

Our anticipated future oil drilling
and producing operations will involve various risks.   

Once we acquire wells and commence oil exploitation activities,
we will be subject to all the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, including: 

well blowouts, cratering, explosions and human related accidents   

mechanical, equipment and pipe failures   

adverse weather conditions and natural disasters   

civil disturbances and terrorist activities   

oil and natural gas price reductions   

environmental risks stemming from the use, production, handling and disposal of water, waste materials, hydrocarbons and other substances into the air, soil or water title problems   

limited availability of financing   

marketing related infrastructure, transportation and processing limitations   

regulatory compliance issues   

We intend to maintain insurance against many potential losses
or liabilities arising from well operations in accordance with customary industry practices and in amounts believed by management
to be prudent. However, insurance will not protect us against all risks.  

8   

Uncertainty of economic conditions,
worldwide and in the United States may have a significant negative effect on operating results, liquidity and financial condition .  

Effects of change in domestic and international
economic conditions could include a decline in demand for oil and natural gas resulting in decreased oil, and natural gas reserves
due to curtailed drilling activity; A decline in reserves would lead to a decline in production, and either a production decline,
or a decrease in oil, and natural gas prices, would have a negative impact on our cash flow, profitability and value. 

There is competition in the oil and
gas industry for acquisition of oil wells and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete.   

Competition in the oil and gas industry
is extremely intense in all aspects, including but not limited to raising investment capital and obtaining qualified managerial
and technical employees. We are an insignificant participant in the oil and gas industry due to our limited financial and personnel
resources. Our competition includes large established oil and gas companies, with substantial capabilities and with greater financial
and technical resources than we have, as well as the myriad of other small stage companies. These companies are able to pay more
for development prospects and productive oil and natural gas properties and are able to define, evaluate, bid for, purchase and
subsequently drill a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. As a result of this
competition, we may be unable to attract the necessary funding or qualified personnel. If we are unable to successfully compete
for funding or for qualified personnel, our activities may be slowed, suspended or terminated, any of which would have a material
adverse effect on our ability to continue operations. 

Shortages of oil field equipment,
services, qualified personnel and resulting cost increases could adversely affect results of operations.   

The demand for qualified and experienced
field personnel, geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry can fluctuate
significantly, often in correlation with oil and natural gas prices, resulting in periodic shortages. When demand for rigs and
equipment increases due to an increase in the number of wells being drilled, there have been shortages of drilling rigs, hydraulic
fracturing equipment and personnel and other oilfield equipment. Higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased
demand for, and result in increased prices of, drilling rigs, crews and associated supplies, equipment and services. These shortages
or price increases could negatively affect the ability to drill wells and conduct ordinary operations by the operators of the Company s
wells, resulting in an adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, cash flow and operating results. 

Our operations will be subject to permitting requirements.   

Oil drilling operations will be subject
to permitting requirements, which could require us to delay, suspend or terminate our operations. Our operations, including but
not limited to any exploitation program, require permits from the U.S. government. We may be unable to obtain these permits in
a timely manner, on reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits, or if there is a delay
in receiving these permits, our timetable and business plan for exploration and/or exploitation, may be materially and adversely
affected. 

9   

International expansion of our business
exposes us to business, regulatory, political, operational, financial and economic risks associated with doing business outside
of the United States.   

We are currently treating oil wells in
Mexico with a plasma pulse technology. Doing business internationally involves a number of risks, including: 

multiple, conflicting and changing laws and regulations such as tax laws, export and import restrictions, employment laws, regulatory requirements and other governmental approvals, permits and licenses;   

failure by us or NENA to obtain regulatory approvals for the sale or use of our technology in various countries;   

difficulties in managing foreign operations;   

financial risks, such as longer payment cycles, difficulty enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable and exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;   

reduced protection for intellectual property rights;   

natural disasters, political and economic instability, including wars, terrorism and political unrest, outbreak of disease, boycotts, curtailment of trade and other business restrictions; and   

failure to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, including its books and records provisions and its anti-bribery provisions, by maintaining accurate information and control over activities.   

Any of these risks, if encountered, could
significantly harm our future international expansion and operations and, consequently, have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

We will have limited control over
the activities on properties for which we own an interest but we do not operate.   

We may acquire interests in oil wells that
will be operated by other companies. We will have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of
these non-operated properties or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. Our dependence
on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation
and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital
and lead to unexpected future costs. 

The loss of key personnel and an
inability to attract and retain additional personnel could affect our ability to successfully grow our business.   

We are highly dependent upon the continued
service and performance of our senior management. The loss of any key employees may significantly delay or prevent the achievement
of our business objectives. We believe that our future success will also depend in part on our and their continued ability to
identify, hire, train and motivate qualified personnel. We face intense competition for qualified individuals. We may not be able
to attract and retain suitably qualified individuals who are capable of meeting our growing operational and managerial requirements,
or we may be required to pay increased compensation in order to do so. Our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel could
impair our ability to implement our business plan.  

We may be adversely affected by actions
of our competitors.   

The market in the oil and gas recovery
industry is highly competitive. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than
we have. We face competition from owners of oil wells as well as large oil and gas companies. Our ability to compete effectively
depends in part on market acceptance of our technology, the environmental impact of our technology and our ability to service customers
in a timely manner. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively or that we will respond appropriately
to industry trends or to activities of competitors.

Although we believe the Licensor
does not have the right to terminate the License Agreement, if the Licensor is successful in its claims, the result could have
material adverse outcomes.   

On July 19, 2016, we received a notice from Licensor purporting to effectively terminate the License Agreement
for non-payment of required royalties, asserting, among other things, that as of June 30, 2016, Novas owed Licensor a   pro
rata   amount of $1,458,333 for the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for the United States and Mexico, of which $1,000,000
was alleged to be in arrears. Licensor has since reiterated its demands, particularly as to its demands related to Mexico. We and
Novas believe that there is no legal basis for Licensor to terminate the License Agreement and intend to vigorously defend against
any attempt by Licensor to enforce a termination of the License Agreement. Further, we believe that Licensor has failed to materially
perform its obligations under the License Agreement, and that such failures on Licensor s part may impact what, if any, payments
are due under the License Agreement by Novas to Licensor. 

Although we and Novas believe that it
is evident from the plain language of the Sublicense Agreement, and the fact that we transferred to NENA substantially all of
its rights for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in the United States of America, that the Sublicense Agreement
replaced and superseded the royalty fees due under the License Agreement for the use of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology in
the Licensed Territory, our termination of the Sublicense Agreement, effective November 1, 2016, will impact our ability to maintain
this license from and thereafter, If minimum royalties are found to be due and not otherwise waived or deferred, any failure to
make the required payments would permit the Licensor to terminate the license. Although we believe that no payment is due with
respect to the territory of the United States and that other payments have been waived or excused, there can be no assurance that
a court would agree with our position. If we were to lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this license, it would halt our ability
to market the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, which could have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating
results and financial condition. In this regard, although we believe that we have developed our own plasma-pulse technology not
based on or otherwise an infringement to, the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, the Licensor has not accepted our claim and no
assurance can be given that we will be successful in deploying our own plasma-pulse technology in lieu of the Licensed Plasma
Pulse Technology.    

As our sole source of income at this time
during the prior year has been through NENA, and the majority of NENA s revenue has been derived from the Sublicense Agreement
with Novas, the termination of the License Agreement or loss of the United States as a Licensed Territory could have a material
adverse effect on our business.  

We rely on a license to use the Licensed
Plasma Pulse Technology that during the prior year has been the sole source of our revenue and if the agreement were to be terminated,
it could have an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.   

We have a License Agreement with the Licensor
granting us the right to use certain critical intellectual property, which we had sub-licensed to NENA, pursuant to the terms of
the Sublicense Agreement that we terminated effective November 1, 2016. If we breach the terms of this agreement, including any
failure to make minimum royalty payments required thereunder, the Licensor has the right to terminate the license. If we were to
lose or otherwise be unable to maintain this license on acceptable terms, or find that it is necessary or appropriate to secure
new licenses from other third parties, it would halt our ability to market the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology, which could have
an immediate material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. 

We may be unable to generate sufficient
revenues to meet the minimum royalties under our license agreement.   

The License Agreement with the Licensor
requires us to pay aggregate minimum royalty payments of $1,000,000 per year. To date, we have not generated enough revenue to
pay minimum royalty payments and the Licensor has threatened to terminate the License Agreement for our failure to pay the royalty
that the Licensor claims is due. No assurance can be given that we will generate sufficient revenue to make these minimum royalty
payments. 

Our future plans and operations may
require that we raise additional capital.   

To date, we have not generated enough
revenue from operations to pay all of our expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and the year ended December 31, 2014
we raised a total of $14,750,000 from our private placement of Series C Preferred stock to Ervington consummated during February
and June 2015. We have used the funds raised in our financings for working capital purposes and intend to acquire an oil
well with the funds that were recently raised. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our goals with
the cash on hand or the cash generated from operations.      

We may not be able to service customers
with the tools that are available to us.   

Although not our primary focus, we are
continuing to treat oil wells with our seven down-hole tools If the tools should require repair we may be unable to service customers.
In addition, with only seven tools, we can only treat a limited number of wells at a time and are unable to treat wells on days
when the tools are in transit from one customer s well to another well.  

There is uncertainty as to market
acceptance of the plasma pulse technology and products.   

Plasma pulse technology has been utilized
in the United States on a limited basis. Neither us nor NENA was able to generate any significant revenue from the application
of plasma pulse technology and there can be no assurance that any plasma pulse technology will be accepted in the market or that
our commercialization efforts will be successful. 

11   

The results of the application of
the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology for initial well treatments may not support future well treatments and are not necessarily
predictive of future long-term results on the wells for which the initial data is favorable.   

To date, we have applied the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology to treat over forty wells in the USA and
an additional twelve wells in Canada, and we do not have long terms results on the wells that were treated. Of such wells, we
have seen improvement results in many wells. Favorable results in our early treatments may not last and may not be repeated in
later treatments of other wells. Success in early treatments does not ensure that wells treated at a later date will be successful.
Additionally, collecting treatment data results is not always possible as operators that pay for the service are not required
to deliver data or we are required to work under non-disclosure agreements.       

The   beneficial ownership of a significant
percentage of our common stock gives Ervington effective control of us, and limits the influence of other shareholders on important
policy and management issues.   

Ervington currently beneficially owns approximately
50.9% of our voting shares on a fully diluted basis (including outstanding options, warrants and convertible instruments). In addition,
Ervington currently has the right to three votes on our board of directors and has appointed two members with an aggregate of three
votes, which constitutes a majority of the votes on our board of directors. As a result of these appointment rights and its voting
control of our company, Ervington has the power to control the outcome of all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval,
including the election of our directors, our business strategy, our day-to-day operations and any proposed merger, consolidation
or sale of all or substantially all of our assets. Ervington s control of our company could discourage the acquisition of
our common stock by potential investors and could have an anti-takeover effect, preventing a change in control of our company that
might be otherwise beneficial to our shareholders, and possibly depress the trading price of our common stock. There can be no
assurance that conflicts of interest will not arise with respect to Ervington s ownership and control of our company or that
any conflicts will be resolved in a manner favorable to the other shareholders of our company. 

Trends in oil and natural gas prices
affect the level of exploration, development, and production activity of our customers and the demand for our services and products,
which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.   

Demand for our services and products or
oil derived from wells we acquire is particularly sensitive to the level of exploration, development, and production activity
of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies. The level of exploration,
development, and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been
volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile. 

Prices for oil and natural gas are subject
to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty,
and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. The recent decline in oil prices from $80 per barrel in December
2014 to $40 per barrel in December 2015 has resulted in a decline in oil drilling which has depressed the immediate level of exploration,
development, and production activity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations,
and consolidated financial condition. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas
companies can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects.
Factors affecting the prices of oil and natural gas include: 

the level of supply
and demand for oil and natural gas, especially demand for natural gas in the United States;  

governmental regulations,
including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas
reserves;  

weather conditions and
natural disasters;  

worldwide political,
military, and economic conditions;  

the level of oil production by non-OPEC countries and the available excess production capacity within OPEC;   

oil refining capacity and shifts in end-customer preferences toward fuel efficiency and the use of natural gas;   

the cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas; and   

potential acceleration of development of alternative fuels.   

12   

Legislative and regulatory changes
affecting the environment and the oil industry could adversely affect our business   

Political, economic and regulatory influences
are subjecting oil recovery efforts to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations.
State and local governments, for example, continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the impact of oil recovery
efforts on the environment. We cannot predict the effect any legislation may have on our business and we can offer no assurances
they will not have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Various federal legislative and regulatory
initiatives have been undertaken which could result in additional requirements or restrictions being imposed on hydraulic fracturing
operations and possibly our operations. For example, the Department of Interior has issued proposed regulations that would apply
to hydraulic fracturing operations on wells that are subject to federal oil and gas leases and that would impose requirements regarding
the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process as well as requirements to obtain certain federal approvals
before proceeding with hydraulic fracturing at a well site. These regulations, if adopted, could also be applicable to our operations
and would establish additional levels of regulation at the federal level that could lead to operational delays and increased operating
costs. At the same time, legislation and/or regulations have been adopted in several states that require additional disclosure
regarding chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but that include protections for proprietary information. Legislation
and/or regulations are being considered at the state and local level that could impose further chemical disclosure or other regulatory
requirements (such as restrictions on the use of certain types of chemicals or prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing operations
and competitive operations in certain areas) that could affect our operations. 

The adoption of any future federal, state,
local, or foreign laws or implementing regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting or banning, the hydraulic fracturing
process if applicable to competitive processes such as ours, could make it more difficult to complete natural gas and oil wells
and could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. 

Liability for cleanup costs, natural
resource damages, and other damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could have a material adverse
effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.   

We will be exposed to claims under environmental
requirements for wells we acquire and treat and the joint venture will be exposed to claims under environmental requirements for
wells it treats. In the United States, environmental requirements and regulations typically impose strict liability. Strict liability
means that in some situations we or the joint venture could be exposed to liability for cleanup costs, natural resource damages,
and other damages as a result of our or the joint ventures conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of prior
operators or other third parties. Liability for damages arising as a result of environmental laws could be substantial and could
have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. 

13   

Existing or future laws, regulations,
related to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business and may result in additional compliance
obligations with respect to the release, capture, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity,
consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.   

Changes in environmental requirements
related to greenhouse gases and climate change may negatively impact demand for our services. For example, oil and natural gas
exploration and production may decline as a result of environmental requirements (including land use policies responsive to environmental
concerns). State, national, and international governments and agencies have been evaluating climate-related legislation and other
regulatory initiatives that would restrict emissions of greenhouse gases in areas in which we conduct business. Because our business
depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws, regulations, treaties, or international
agreements related to greenhouse gases and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources,
could have a negative impact on our business if such laws, regulations, treaties, or international agreements reduce the worldwide
demand for oil and natural gas. Likewise, such restrictions may result in additional compliance obligations with respect to the
release, capture, sequestration, and use of carbon dioxide that could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, consolidated
results of operations, and consolidated financial condition.      

Our failure to protect our proprietary
information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely
affect our competitive position.   

We rely on a variety of intellectual property
rights that we use in our services and products. We may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights
in the future, and these rights could be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. In this regard, while we believe that we have
developed our own plasma-pulse technology not based on or otherwise an infringement to, the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology,
the Licensor has not accepted our claim. If our claim were to be invalidated or challenged, we will not be able to deploy our
own plasma-pulse technology in lieu of the Licensed Plasma Pulse Technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in
which our services and products may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the
United States. Our failure to protect our proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement
proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position. 

Any future recompletion activities engaged upon by us
on wells that we acquire may not be productive.   

We may acquire properties upon which we
believe recompletion activity will be successful. Recompletion or workovers on oil and natural gas wells involves numerous risks,
including the risk that we will not encounter commercially productive oil or natural-gas reservoirs. The costs of recompleting,
and operating wells are often uncertain, and operations may be curtailed, delayed, or canceled as a result of a variety of factors,
including the following unexpected drilling conditions: 

pressure or irregularities
in formations;  

equipment failures or
accidents;  

fires, explosions, blowouts,
and surface cratering;  

difficulty identifying
and retaining qualified personnel;  

title problems;  

other adverse weather
conditions; and  

shortages or delays
in the delivery of equipment  

Certain of our future activities may not
be successful and, if unsuccessful, this failure could have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial
condition.

We have no separate independent audit
committee. Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is composed of four directors, none of whom are considered
to be independent. This may hinder our Board of Directors  effectiveness in fulfilling the functions of the audit committee.   

Currently, we have no separate audit committee.
Our full Board of Directors functions as our audit committee and is comprised of four directors, one of whom has two votes and
none of whom are considered to be  independent  in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange
Act. An independent audit committee plays a crucial role in the corporate governance process, assessing the Company's processes
relating to its risks and control environment, overseeing financial reporting, and evaluating internal and independent audit processes.
The lack of an independent audit committee may prevent the Board of Directors from being independent from management in its judgments
and decisions and its ability to pursue the committee's responsibilities without undue influence. We may have difficulty attracting
and retaining directors with the requisite qualifications. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified, independent directors,
the management of our business could be compromised.  

Our Board of Directors, which does
not have a majority of independent directors, acts as our compensation committee, which presents the risk that compensation and
benefits paid to these executive officers that are board members and other officers may not be commensurate with our financial
performance.   

A compensation committee consisting of
independent directors is a safeguard against self-dealing by company executives. Our Board of Directors acts as the compensation
committee and determines the compensation and benefits of our executive officers, administers our employee stock and benefit plans,
and reviews policies relating to the compensation and benefits of our employees. Although all board members have fiduciary obligations
in connection with compensation matters, our lack of an independent compensation committee presents the risk that our executive
officers on the board may have influence over their personal compensation and benefits levels that may not be commensurate with
our financial performance. 

Trading on the OTCQB may be sporadic
because it is not a stock exchange, and stockholders may have difficulty reselling their shares.   

Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQB is
often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations
or business prospects. Moreover, the OTCQB is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTCQB is often more sporadic
than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like NASDAQ or a stock exchange like NYSE. Accordingly, you may have
difficulty reselling any of the shares you purchase from the selling stockholders. 

We cannot guarantee that an active
trading market will develop for our common stock.   

There currently is not an active public
market for our common stock and there can be no assurance that a regular trading market for our common stock will ever develop
or that, if developed, it will be sustained. Therefore, purchasers of our common stock should have long-term investment intent
and should recognize that it may be difficult to sell the shares, notwithstanding the fact that they are not restricted securities.
We cannot predict the extent to which a trading market will develop or how liquid a market might become. 

There may be future dilution of our
common stock.   

If we sell additional equity or convertible
debt securities, those sales could result in additional dilution to our stockholders. Holders of our Series A-1 Preferred Stock
have the right to convert their shares into 31,375,000 shares of common stock and; the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock has
the right to convert his shares into 4,000,000 common shares and Ervington, the sole holder of the Series C Preferred Stock has
the right to convert its shares of Series C Preferred Stock into 120,000,000 shares of common stock. We also have warrants outstanding
that are convertible into 6,339,498 shares of our common stock. 

Recent accounting changes may make
it more difficult for us to sustain profitability.   

We are a publicly traded company, and are
therefore subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act ), which requires that our internal controls
and procedures comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We expect compliance to be costly and it could impact our results
of operations in future periods. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board now requires us to follow the accounting
standards on share based payments. Under this rule, companies must calculate and record in their statement of operations the cost
of equity instruments, such as stock options or restricted stock, awarded to employees for services. We expect that we will use
stock options to attract, incentivize and retain our employees and will therefore incur the resulting stock-based compensation
expense. This will continue to adversely affect our operating results in future periods. 

15   

Maintaining and improving our financial
controls and the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management s attention and affect
our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.   

As a public company, we are subject to
the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of an exchange or the OTCQB.
The requirements of these rules and regulations will likely continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance
costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and may also place undue strain on our personnel, systems
and resources.  

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among
other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal control over financial reporting.
Significant resources and management oversight are required to design, document, test, implement and monitor internal control over
relevant processes and to, remediate any deficiencies. As a result, management s attention may be diverted from other business
concerns, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. These efforts also involve substantial
accounting related costs. 

We have identified material weaknesses
in our internal controls, and we cannot provide assurances that these weaknesses will be effectively remediated or that additional
material weaknesses will not occur in the future. If our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and
procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud, or file our periodic
reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to
a decline in our stock price.   

Our management is responsible for establishing
and maintaining adequate internal control over our financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. We
have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls with respect to our financial statement for the year ended December
31, 2014. Our management discovered insufficient controls over review and accounting for certain complex transactions and a lack
of segregation of duties. 

The design of monitoring controls used
to assess the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls is inadequate. 

We have begun to take actions that we believe
will substantially remediate the material weaknesses identified. In response to the identification of our material weaknesses,
we are in the process of expanding our finance and accounting staff. However, we cannot assure you that our internal control over
financial reporting, as modified, will enable us to identify or avoid material weaknesses in the future. 

We have never paid dividends and
have no plans to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.   

Holders of shares of our common stock
are entitled to receive such dividends as may be declared by our Board of Directors. To date, we have paid no cash dividends on
our shares of our preferred or common stock and we do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future on our common
stock. Our Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate of 4% per annum of the stated price, which initially is $3.277777778
payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year. In addition, our Series B Preferred Stock accrues dividends at the rate
of 8% per annum of the stated price, which initially is $10.00 payable annually in arrears on December 31 of each year. Other
than dividend payments on the preferred stock we intend to retain future earnings, if any, to provide funds for operations of
our business. Therefore, any return investors in our preferred or common stock may have will be in the form of appreciation, if
any, in the market value of their shares of common stock.      

16   

Our stock price may be volatile
or may decline regardless of our operating performance.   

The market price of our common stock may
fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: 

price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;   

changes in operating
performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;  

the public s response
to our press releases or other public announcements, including our filings with the SEC;  

announcements by us
or our competitors of significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;  

introduction of technologies
or product enhancements that reduce the need for our products;  

market conditions or
trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;  

the loss of key personnel;  

lawsuits threatened
or filed against us;  

future sales of our
common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders; and  

other events or factors,
including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.  

We may issue preferred stock with
greater rights than our common stock.   

Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes
the Board of Directors to issue up to 10 million shares of preferred stock, par value $.001 per share. The preferred stock may
be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance without
further action by stockholders, and may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters),
preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. Any preferred stock
that is issued may rank ahead of our common stock, in terms of dividends, liquidation rights and voting rights that could adversely
affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our common stock. In the event of such an issuance, the Preferred Stock
could be utilized, under certain circumstances, as a method of discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control of our
company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors or management could deter
potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could require substantial premium over
the then current market price per share. We currently have 3,137,500 Series A-1 Preferred Stock outstanding, 40,000 Series B Preferred
Stock outstanding and have 4,500,000 Series C Preferred Stock outstanding. The Series C Preferred Stock has the right to annual
dividends in preference to all other preferred stock and the common stock and the Series B Preferred Stock is also entitled to
an annual dividend. The Series A-1, B and C Preferred Stock all have liquidation preferences over the common stock. In addition
the vote of a majority of the Series C Preferred Stock will be required for the (i) merger, sale of substantially all of our assets
or our recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or winding up, (ii) redemption or acquisition of shares of our
common stock other than in limited circumstances, (iii) declaration or payment of a dividend or distribution with respect to our
capital stock, (iv) making any loan or advance, (v) amending our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws, (vi) authorizing or creating
any new class or series of equity security, (vii) increasing the number of authorized shares for issuance under any existing stock
or option plan, (viii) materially changing the nature of the business, (ix) incurring any indebtedness, (x) engaging in or making
investments not authorized by the Board of Directors, (xi) acquiring or divesting a material amount of assets (xii) selling, assigning,
licensing, pledging or encumbering our material technology or intellectual property, and (xiii) entering into any corporate strategic
relationship involving payment, contribution or assignment by us or to us of any assets. The vote of two-thirds of the Series A-1
Preferred Stock is also required to take certain actions similar to those set forth above. 

17   

If we fail to meet the new eligibility
requirements of the OTC Market Group, we will no longer be eligible to have our common stock quoted on the OTCQB.   

If we fail to maintain a minimum bid price
of $.01 per share one day per each thirty consecutive days, our stock will no longer be eligible to be traded on the OTCQB and
will be traded on the pink sheets. Effective May 1, 2014, the OTC Market Group implemented new eligibility standards for companies
traded on the OTCQB that include enhanced disclosure requirements. Investors of companies that do not meet the eligibility requirements
will not have the benefit of the additional disclosure
