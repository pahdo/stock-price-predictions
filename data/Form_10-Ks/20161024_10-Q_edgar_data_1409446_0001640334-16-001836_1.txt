     Table of Contents           NATE S FOOD CO.     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (UNAUDITED)       Note 1   Basis of Presentation      Nate s Food Co. ( we ,  us ,  our , the "Company" or the "Registrant") was incorporated in the state of Colorado on January 12, 2000. Nate s Food Co. is domiciled in the state of Colorado, and its corporate headquarters are located in Huntington Beach, California. The Company selected May 31 as its fiscal year end. On May 12, 2014, Nate s Pancakes Inc. was incorporated in the state of Indiana. On May 19, 2014, the Company completed a reverse merger with Nate s Pancakes, Inc. Nate s Pancakes was the surviving Company. In May 2014, the Company changed its name from Capital Resource Alliance to Nate s Food Co.     We sell a ready-to-use, pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter delivered in a pressurized can. Our current product is an original flavor of pancake and waffle batter. We are currently in the process of developing additional flavors and products with the goal to have 10 products in development in 2017. Currently, we have developed three flavors for our pancake and waffle mix. We plan to continue to expand into other baked goods and other non-breakfast areas.     The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's annual report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K, on October 6, 2016. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements which would substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year 2016 as reported in Form 10-K, have been omitted.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. A change in managements  estimates or assumptions could have a material impact on Nate s Food Co. financial condition and results of operations during the period in which such changes occurred. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Nate s Food Co. s financial statements reflect all adjustments that management believes are necessary for the fair presentation of their financial condition and results of operations for the periods presented.      Reclassifications      Certain amounts in the fiscal 2016 financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2017 presentation. These reclassifications have no impact on net loss/income.      Recently Adopted Accounting Standards      In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-03, Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The updated guidance requires debt issuance costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability in the balance sheet. The Company adopted the standard on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this standard reduced both deferred financing cost and convertible note and note payable long-term by $17,496 on the audited Balance Sheet as of May 31, 2016.                  6       
     Table of Contents          Long-Lived Assets      Long-lived assets such as property and equipment are stated at their fair value acquisition cost and reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortization of long-lived assets are calculated by the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available, the Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets.     Depreciation is computed for financial statement purposes on a straight-line basis over estimated useful lives of the related assets. The estimated useful lives of depreciable assets are:                     Estimated               Useful Lives       Equipment         10 years         As of August 31, 2016, equipment of $395,195 reflects acquisition costs. During the period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, depreciation expense was $9,880 and $0, respectively      Fair Value of Financial Instruments      The Company's financial instruments consist primarily of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accrued expenses, convertible notes and Note payable. The carrying amounts of such financial instruments approximate their respective estimated fair value due to the short-term maturities and approximate market interest rates of these instruments.      The Company adopted ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements  ("ASC Topic 820"), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  The standard provides a consistent definition of fair value which focuses on an exit price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The standard also prioritizes, within the measurement of fair value, the use of market-based information over entity specific information and establishes a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements based on the nature of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date.     The three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements is defined as follows:                    Level 1   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; liabilities in active markets;                                  Level 2   inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability other than quoted prices, either directly or indirectly, including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active; or directly or indirectly including inputs in markets that are not considered to be active;                            Level 3   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement           The following table summarizes fair value measurements by level at August 31, 2016, and May 31, 2016, measured at fair value on a recurring basis:                              7       
     Table of Contents          Note 2   Going Concern      The Company's financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. However, the Company has negative working capital, recurring losses from operations, and does not have an established source of revenues sufficient to cover its operating costs. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.     The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plan described in the preceding paragraph and eventually attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that may be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.     In the coming year, the Company s foreseeable cash requirements will relate to continual development of the operations of its business, maintaining its good standing and making the requisite filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the payment of expenses associated with operations and business developments. The Company may experience a cash shortfall and be required to raise additional capital.     Historically, it has mostly relied upon internally generated funds such as shareholder loans and advances to finance its operations and growth. Management may raise additional capital by retaining net earnings or through future public or private offerings of the Company s stock or through loans from private investors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such financing. The Company s failure to do so could have a material and adverse effect upon it and its shareholders.      Note 3   Related Party Transactions       Notes Payable   Related Parties            During the three months ended August 31, 2016, the Company borrowed $65,018 from our officer for working capital.

Management s  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS      Certain matters discussed herein are forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements contained herein involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:                     our future operating results;             our business prospects;             our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties;             the dependence of our future success on the general economy;             our possible financings; and             the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital.          These forward-looking statements can generally be identified as such because the context of the statement will include words such as we  believe,   anticipate,   expect,   estimate  or words of similar meaning. Similarly, statements that describe our future plans, objectives or goals are also forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which are described in close proximity to such statements and which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated as of the date of this report. Shareholders, potential investors and other readers are urged to consider these factors in evaluating the forward-looking statements and are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements included herein are only made as of the date of this report, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update such forward-looking statements to reflect subsequent events or circumstances.         General Overview      We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on January 12, 2000, under the name Capital Resources Alliance, Inc. At inception, we were a development stage company in the business of mining and exploration. On May 19, 2014 our company completed a reverse merger with Nate s Pancakes, Inc., an Indiana company, with Nate s Pancakes being the surviving entity. In May 2014, we changed our name from Capital Resource Alliance, Inc. to Nate s Food Co.     In connection with the reverse merger, we became a food manufacturing and product company, and in May 2014, we executed a licensing agreement with Nate s Pancakes to market and sell  Nate s Homemade , exclusively throughout the world.      Our Current Business      We are a food manufacturing and product company that manufactures, distributes and sells ready-to-use, pre-mixed pancake and waffle batter. We hold a 20 year worldwide exclusive license agreement for Nate s Homemade.      On August 23, 2016, we entered in to an arrangement with one of California's largest aerosol producers to begin pilot production runs of Nate's Homemade Pancake and Waffle Batter in order to start supplying Southern California grocery stores. This will enable our company to expand our current online sales activity to include distribution to regional grocery chains without impacting our ongoing development activities with ABCO Laboratories Inc. in Northern California.             Results of Operations       Three Months Ended August 31, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended August 31, 2015             Revenue      Our company generated $2,734 in revenue with a gross profit of $2,734 or 100%, for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to $21,068 in revenue with a gross profit of $8,268, or 39%, for the three months ended August 31, 2015.       Operating Expenses      Operating expenses were relatively unchanged for the three months ended August 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.     During the period ended August 31, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $38,794 compared to $66,683 incurred during the period ended August 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in stock based compensation of $59,862 and an increase in license fee of $22,000 and professional fee of $5,500.            Liquidity and Capital Resources                  As of August 31, 2016 our company had $1,996 in cash, and $385,315 in equipment and a total of $387,311 in assets. In management s opinion, our company s cash position is insufficient to maintain our operations at the current level for the next 12 months. Any expansion may cause our company to require additional capital until such expansion begins generating revenue. It is anticipated that the raising of additional funds will principally be through the sales of our securities.      As of August 31, 2016, our total current liabilities were $545,284 which primarily consisted of $240,526 in notes payable   related parties, $158,942, in derivative liability, $70,703 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $27,943 in convertible notes as compared to May 31, 2016, with total current liabilities of $2,631,118 which primarily consisted of $2,039,179 in derivative liability, $175,508 in notes payable - related parties, $53,098 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and $192,619 in convertible notes.      Accounting and Audit Plan      We estimate that our operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next 12 months to be as follows:            We have suffered recurring losses from operations. The continuation of our company is dependent upon our company attaining and maintaining profitable operations and raising additional capital as needed.  The continuation of our business is dependent upon obtaining further financing and achieving a profitable level of operations. The issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders.            There are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations. As noted herein, we are pursuing various financing alternatives to meet our immediate and long-term financial requirements. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us when needed or, if available, that it can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms. If we are not able to obtain the additional financing on a timely basis, we will be unable to conduct our operations as planned, and we will not be able to meet our other obligations as they become due. In such event, we will be forced to scale down or perhaps even cease our operations.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, and capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to stockholders.      Critical Accounting Policies       The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies. We believe that understanding the basis and nature of the estimates and assumptions involved with the following aspects of our financial statements is critical to an understanding of our financial statements.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.        Long-Lived Assets      Long-lived assets such as property and equipment are stated at their fair value acquisition cost and reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Amortization of long-lived assets are calculated by the straight line method over their estimated useful lives. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are not available, our company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the recovery of the assets.     As of August 31, 2016, equipment of $385,315 reflects acquisition costs. During the period ended August 31, 2016 and 2015, depreciation expense was $9,880 and $0, respectively      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      Our company has implemented all new accounting pronouncements that are in effect and that may impact its financial statements and does not believe that there are any other new accounting pronouncements that have been issued that might have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations.             Item 3. Quantitative  and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk      As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures        Management s Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures      We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 , as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     As of the end of the quarter covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our chief executive officer (our principal executive officer) and our chief financial officer (our principal financial officer and principle accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of August 31, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules, regulations and forms, and (ii) that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     C hanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting      During the period covered by this report there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings       None.       Item 1A. Risk Factors       As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.
