NOTE
1 - INTRODUCTION   

On
April 29, 2016, Medina International Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) entered into an Acquisition and Purchase Agreement
with Medical Innovation Holdings, a Joint Venture ( MedHold ) effective April 29, 2016, whereby all of the assets
of MedHold were acquired by the Company. In conjunction therewith, 35,100,000 shares (post-reverse split 1-for-10) were issued.
Since the owners of MedHold now own approximately 94% of Medina, this transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of
Medina by MedHold resulting in a recapitalization of Medhold. Accordingly, the financial statements presented herein do not contain
comparisons to the prior fiscal year, as operations with MedHold have only been ongoing since April 29, 2016.  

Prior
to the acquisition, Medina went through a restructuring and divesture. For details, please see the 8-K/A filed by Medina on June
6, 2016.  

The
Company is establishing a nationwide, state-by-state, multi-disciplinary medical specialist provider/practice network, staffed
by 16 types of Physician Specialists. These Physician Specialists will provide virtual medical consultations to the potential
millions of rural patient population base who are chronically underserved. This will be accomplished via a seamless, comprehensive,
sophisticated end-to-end virtual medicine program.  

On
August 9, 2016 the Company announced that it had set up a subsidiary, 3Point Care, to provide services critical to the Company
for the administration, scheduling, claims processing, technical support as well as delivering medical and health related services.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United
States, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company is a development stage enterprise and has
limited operations as of July 31, 2016. On July 31, 2016, the Company s had a stockholders  deficiency of $ 736,751.  

Management
is devoting considerable effort to establish a business as discussed above. Management has taken various steps in that direction
and it believes that its actions will allow the Company to continue its operations through the next fiscal year.  

The
future success of the Company is likely dependent on its ability to attain additional capital to develop its proposed products
and ultimately, upon its ability to attain future profitable operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful
in obtaining such financing, or that it will obtain positive cash flow.  

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:   

Presentation
of Interim Information   

In
the opinion of the management of the Company, the accompanying unaudited financial statements include all normal adjustments considered
necessary to present fairly the financial position and operating results of the Company for the period presented. The financial
statements and notes are presented as permitted by Form 10-Q, and do not contain certain information included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2016. It is management s opinion that when the interim financial
statements are read in conjunction with the April 30, 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the disclosures are adequate to make the
information presented not misleading. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year or any future
period. The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries were prepared
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and include the
assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Significant
estimates and assumptions are used for, but are not limited to;  

1)
Revenue recognition;  

2)
Allowance for doubtful accounts;  

3)
Inventory costs;  

4)
Asset impairments;  

5)
Depreciable lives of assets;  

6)
Income tax reserves and valuation allowances;  

7)
Fair value of stock options;  

8)
Allocation of direct and indirect cost of sales; and  

9)
Contingent liabilities.  

Future
events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty; accordingly, our accounting estimates require judgment. We base our
estimates on historical experience, available market information, appropriate valuation methodologies, and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable. We evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside
experts to assist in our evaluation, when necessary. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Revenue
Recognition is recognized when earned. The Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin (SAB) 104. Sales revenue is recognized at the date services are rendered and no other significant obligations of the
Company exist and collectability is reasonably assured. Payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition
are satisfied, are recorded as unearned revenue.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase that are readily convertible
into cash to be cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash in bank deposit accounts that may exceed federally insured limits.
The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts.  

Accounts
Receivable   

The
Company reviews its accounts receivables accounts periodically for collectability and establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts
and records bad debt expense when deemed necessary.  

Advertising
costs   

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. The Company recorded no advertisement costs in the three months ended July 31, 2016.  

Inventory   

We
carry our inventories at the lower of their cost or market value. Cost is determined using first-in, first-out ( FIFO )
method. Market is determined based on net realizable value. We also provide due consideration to obsolescence, excess quantities,
and other factors in evaluating net realizable value.  

Fixed
Assets   

Capital
assets are stated at cost. Equipment consists of medical equipment and related assets. Depreciation of fixed assets is provided
using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives (3-7 years) of the assets. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs
are charged to expense as incurred.

Long
Lived Assets   

The
Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets  ( SFAS 144 ), now codified in ASC 350,which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment
or disposal of long-lived assets and supersedes SFAS No. 121,  Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of,  and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30,  Reporting
the Results of Operations for a Disposal of a Segment of a Business.  The Company periodically evaluates the carrying value
of long-lived assets to be held and used in accordance with ASC 350. ASC 350 requires impairment losses to be recorded on long-lived
assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated
by those assets are less than the assets  carrying amounts. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which
the carrying amount exceeds the fair market value of the long-lived assets. Loss on long-lived assets to be disposed of is determined
in a similar manner, except that fair market values are reduced  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the accounting bases and the tax bases of the Company s
assets and liabilities. Any deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.  

GAAP
generally requires that recognized revenue, expenses, gains and losses be included in net income. Certain statements, however,
require entities to report specific changes in assets and liabilities, such as unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
securities, as a separate component of the equity section of the balance sheet. Such items, along with net income, are components
of comprehensive income.  

Issuance
of Shares for Service   

The
Company accounts for employee and non-employee stock awards under ASC 718, whereby equity instruments issued to employees for
services are recorded based on the fair value of the instrument issued and those issued to non-employees are recorded based on
the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument, whichever is more reliably measurable.  

Foreign
Currency Translations and Hedging   

The
Company will be exposed to foreign currency fluctuations due to international trade. Management does not intend to enter into
forward exchange contracts or any derivative financial investments for trading purposes. There is no present international trade
and as such management does not currently hedge foreign currency exposure.  

Basic
and Diluted Net Loss per Share   

Net
loss per share is calculated in accordance with FASB ASC 105. Basic net loss per share is based upon the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding. Diluted net loss per share is based on the assumption that all dilutive convertible shares and stock
options were converted or exercised. Dilution is computed by applying the treasury stock method. Under this method, options and
warrants are assumed to be exercised at the beginning of the period (or at the time of issuance, if later), and as if funds obtained
thereby were used to purchase common stock at the average market price during the period.  

Products
and Services, Geographic Areas and Major Customers   

The
Company intends to establish a nationwide, state-by-state, multi-disciplinary medical specialist provider/practice network, staffed
by 16 types of Physician Specialists. These specialist Physicians will provide virtual medical consultations to the potential
millions of rural patients who are chronically underserved. This will be accomplished via a seamless, comprehensive, sophisticated
end to end virtual medicine program.  

Recently
issued accounting pronouncements   

In
May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand
the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the
FASB deferred the effective date of the revenue recognition guidance to reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early
adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are continuing to evaluate our method of adoption
and the impact this ASU, and related amendments and interpretations, will have on our consolidated financial statements ( CFS ).  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as
a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ), which requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an
entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides
guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures
will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern.
ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016,
with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on the
Company s CFS.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance
requires that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent
on the balance sheet. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within
those annual periods. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its CFS.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The guidance in ASU 2016-02 supersedes the lease recognition
requirements in ASC Topic 840, Leases (FAS 13). ASU 2016-02requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities arising from
a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures. ASU 2016-02 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the effect this standard will have on its CFS.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for stock-based compensation and requiring excess tax benefits and
deficiencies to be recognized as a component of income tax expense rather than equity. This guidance also requires excess tax
benefits to be presented as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows and allows an entity to make an accounting policy
election to either estimate expected forfeitures or to account for them as they occur. The ASU is effective for reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU; however,
we expect the ASU will have a material impact on our CFS.  

As
of July 31, 2016, there are no recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted that would have a material effect on the Company s
financial statements to have a material impact on the Company s CFS.

in excess of $100,000. The Note was subject to a release of liability and was assigned to a subsidiary of the former Medina International
Holdings, Inc., which was the original maker of the Note. The release was conditional upon the Note being paid and in the event
of non-payment, the release would be null and void. Since the Note is unpaid and the former subsidiary does not have the ability
to pay, the Company has recorded a liability for the Note in these financial statements. The Company evaluated and recorded beneficial
conversion on this note in prior years financial statements.

ten old shares basis, with fractional shares being rounded up to the next whole share, and sought authorization to change the
Company s name to Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc. (note these actions required an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation
and required the approval of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA ), which was granted). The majority
shareholders approved both proposals and a Schedule 14C Information Statement was filed on August 8, 2016. The stock split and
name change were effective September 15, 2016, and as such, the numbers reflected in the unaudited financial statements are post-split

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements and notes thereto included herein.
In connection with, and because we desire to take advantage of, the  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding certain forward looking statements in the following discussion and
elsewhere in this report and in any other statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not in future filings with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. Forward-looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate to future
operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates
and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies,
many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These
uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in any forward looking statements made by, or on our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward-looking statements.   

The
independent registered public accounting firm s report on the Company s financial statements as of April 30, 2016,
and for each of the years in the two-year period then ended, includes a  going concern  explanatory paragraph, that
describes substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.    

On
April 29, 2016, Medina International Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) entered into an Acquisition and Purchase Agreement
with Medical Innovation Holdings, a Joint Venture ( MedHold ) effective April 29, 2016, whereby all of the assets
of MedHold were acquired by the Company. In conjunction therewith, 35,100,000 shares (post-reverse split 1-for-10) were issued.
Since the owners of MedHold now own approximately 94% of Medina, this transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition of
Medina by MedHold resulting in a recapitalization of Medhold. Accordingly, the financial statements presented herein do not contain
comparisons to the prior fiscal year, as operations with MedHold have only been ongoing since April 29, 2016.  

Prior
to the acquisition, Medina went through a restructuring and divesture. For details, please see 8-K/A filed by Medina on June 6,
2016.  

The
Company is establishing a nationwide, state-by-state, multi-disciplinary medical specialist provider/practice network, staffed
by 16 types of Physician Specialists. These Physician Specialists will provide virtual medical consultations to the potential
millions of rural patients who are chronically underserved. This will be accomplished via a seamless, comprehensive, sophisticated
end-to-end virtual medicine program.  

On
August 9, 2016 the Company announced that it set up a subsidiary, 3Point Care, to serve as our Management Service Organization
(MSO) to manage all Healthcare Operations of the Company. This subsidiary will provide services to the Company for the administration,
scheduling, claims processing, technical support as well as delivering medical and health related services.  

On
or about June 24, 2016, the Company proposed a reverse split of the common stock issued and outstanding on a one new share for
ten old shares basis, with fractional shares being rounded up to the next whole share, and sought authorization to change the
Company s name to Medical Innovation Holdings, Inc. (note these actions require an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation
and require the approval of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ( FINRA )). The majority shareholders approved
both proposals and a Schedule 14C Information Statement was filed on August 8, 2016. The stock split and name change were effective
September 15, 2016, and as such, the numbers reflected herein are retroactively restated as post-split figures.  

Our
securities are currently not liquid. There are limited market makers in our securities and it is not anticipated that any market
will develop for our securities until such time as we successfully implement our business plan of providing virtual medical consultations
to a rural patient population base.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

For
the Three Months Ended July 31, 2016, , there is no comparison as MedHold did not exist prior to April 29, 2016.   

The
Company recognized no revenues during the three months ended July 31, 2016.  

During
the three months ended July 31, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $246,678, which expenses were mainly
due to the costs of reorganization.  

During
the three months ended July 31, 2016, the Company recognized a net loss of $246,678 due to the general and administrative expenses.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

As
of July 31, 2016, the Company had $69,822 cash on hand. The Company s total current liabilities were $806,573 as of July
31, 2016, which was mainly accounts payable and accrued expenses of $344,643, short-term debt of $18,100, notes payable of $441,930,
and short-term borrowings from shareholders of $1,900. At July 31, 2016, the Company s current liabilities exceeded current
assets by $736,751.  

The
Company received $0 in operating activities for the three-month period ended July 31, 2016.  

The
Company did not have any investment activities during the three months ended July 31, 2016.

the deficit of $246,678 in the three-month period.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company s auditors issued a  going concern  statement as part of their opinion in the Audit Report. For the
year ended April 30, 2016 and for each of the years in the two-year period then ended, includes a  going concern 
explanatory paragraph, that describes substantial doubt about the Company s ability of the Company to continue as a  going
concern.   

Short
Term.   

On
a short-term basis, we do not generate revenues sufficient to cover operations. Based on prior history, we will continue to have
insufficient revenue to satisfy current and recurring liabilities as we continue to develop our operations. For short term needs
we will be dependent on receipt, if any, of offering proceeds.  

Need
for Additional Financing    

We
do not have capital sufficient to meet our cash needs. We will have to seek loans or equity placements to cover such cash needs.
No commitments to provide additional funds have been made by our management or other stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no
assurance that any additional funds will be available to us to allow it to cover our expenses as they may be incurred.  

There
is no assurance that the Company will be profitable, the Company may not be able to successfully develop, manage or market its
products and services, the Company may not be able to attract or retain qualified executives and personnel, the Company s
products and services may become obsolete, government regulation may hinder the Company s business, additional dilution
in outstanding stock ownership may be incurred due to the issuance of more shares, warrants and stock options, or the exercise
of warrants and stock options, and other risks inherent in the Company s businesses.  

The
Company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise
after the date hereof. Readers should carefully review the factors described in other documents the Company files from time to
time with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q
filed by the Company and any Current Reports on Form 8-K filed by the Company.  

Contractual
Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments   

The
Company does not have sufficient capital to meet its cash needs, including the costs of compliance with the continuing reporting
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management will have to seek loans or equity placements to cover such cash
needs and cover outstanding payables. Lack of existing capital may be a sufficient impediment to prevent the Company from accomplishing
its goal of expanding operations. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to carry out our business. No commitments
to provide additional funds have been made by the Company s management or other shareholders. Accordingly, there can be
no assurance that any additional funds will be available to the Company to cover its expenses as they are incurred.  

Irrespective
of whether the Company s cash assets prove to be inadequate to meet its operational needs, the management might seek to
compensate providers of services by issuances of stock in lieu of cash.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

In
accordance with the definition under SEC rules, the following qualify as off-balance sheet arrangements:  

a)
Any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts;  

b)
A retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar entity or similar arrangement that
serves as credit, liquidity, or market risk support to that entity for such assets;  

c)
Any obligation under certain derivative instruments; and  

d)
Any obligation under a material variable interest held by the registrant in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing,
liquidity, market risk, or credit risk support to the registrant, or engages in leasing, hedging, or research and development
services with the registrant.  

The
following will address each of the above items pertaining to the Company.  

As
of July 31, 2016, we do not have any obligation under certain guarantees or contracts as defined above.  

As
of July 31, 2016, we do not have any retained or contingent interest in assets as defined above.  

As
of July 31, 2016, we do not hold derivative financial instruments.  

Accounting
for Derivative Instrument and Hedging Activities, as amended.   

As
of July 31, 2016, we did not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities ( SPEs ), which
would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited
purposes. As of July 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, we were not involved in any unconsolidated SPE transactions.  

Dividends

Company has not declared or paid any cash dividend on its common stock and does not anticipate paying dividends for the foreseeable

4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    

Disclosures
Controls and Procedures  

We
have adopted and maintained disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a 15(e) and 15d-15(e) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) that are designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods required under the SEC s rules and forms and that the information is gathered and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer),
as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

As
required by SEC Rule 15d-15(b), our Chief Executive Officer carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange
Act Rule 15d-14 as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective in timely alerting
them to material information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings and to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in our periodic SEC filings is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of the deficiency in our internal
control over financial reporting discussed below.  

Management s
assessment of the effectiveness of the small business issuer s internal control over financial reporting is as of the quarter
ended July 31, 2016. We believe that internal control over financial reporting is not effective because of the small size of the
business. We have not identified any, current material weaknesses considering the nature and extent of our current operations
and any risks or errors in financial reporting under current operations.  

There
was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended July 31, 2016, that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
