  1. Basis of Presentation and Responsibility for Interim Financial Statements 
  Nature of Operations.      Vista Outdoor Inc. (together with our subsidiaries, "we", "our", and "us") is a leading global designer, manufacturer, and marketer of consumer products in the growing outdoor sports and recreation markets. We operate in   two   segments, Outdoor Products and Shooting Sports.  Vista Outdoor is headquartered in Farmington, Utah and has manufacturing operations and facilities in 13 U.S. States, Canada, Mexico, and Puerto Rico along with international customer service, sales, and sourcing operations in Asia, Australia, Canada, Europe, and New Zealand. Vista Outdoor was incorporated in Delaware in 2014. 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and combined financial statements and notes included in our fiscal 2016 financial statements as filed on Form 8-K on August 11, 2016.  
    
  Basis of Presentation.      Our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the SEC for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules, certain disclosures and other financial information that are normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States can be condensed or omitted.  Our accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated and combined financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 ( fiscal 2016 ). Management is responsible for the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this document, which are unaudited but, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of our financial position as of   October 2, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  , our results of operationss for the   quarters and six month periods ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   and our cash flows for the six months ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  . 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements.    On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . The new guidance was issued to increase transparency and comparability among companies by requiring most leases be included on the balance sheet and by expanding disclosure requirements. Based on the current effective dates, the new guidance would first apply in the first quarter of our fiscal 2020. We are in the process of evaluating the effect of adoption on our financial statements.  
    
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-09   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and classification in the statement of cash flows.  The standard allows for early adoption.  As of March 31, 2016 we elected to early adopt this standard and prospectively present the change to the financial statements given the immaterial nature of the prior period balances.   
    
  Besides those noted above and in our fiscal 2016 financial statements there are no other new accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a significant impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

2. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The current authoritative guidance on fair value clarifies the definition of fair value, prescribes a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used to measure fair value, and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. 
  The valuation techniques required by the current authoritative literature are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: 
  Level 1 Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
  Level 2 Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
  Level 3 Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable.

  2. Fair Value of Financial Instruments (Continued) 

The following section describes the valuation methodologies we used to measure our financial instruments at fair value. 
  Long-term debt   The fair value of the variable-rate long-term debt is calculated based on current market rates for debt of the same risk and maturities.  The fair value of the fixed-rate long-term debt is based on market quotes for the outstanding notes. We consider these to be Level 2 instruments. 
  Contingent Consideration   The acquisition-related contingent consideration liability represents the estimated fair value of additional future earn-outs payable for acquisitions of businesses that included earn-out clauses. The valuation of the contingent consideration will be evaluated on an ongoing basis and is based on management estimates and entity-specific assumptions which are considered Level 3 inputs. See Note 4 for further details. 
  The following table presents our financial assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The carrying values and estimated fair values were as follows: 

3. Earnings Per Share 
    
  The computation of earnings per share ("EPS") includes Basic EPS computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares and common equivalent shares. Common equivalent shares represent the effect of stock-based awards during each period presented, which, if exercised or earned, would have a dilutive effect on EPS.  
    
  In computing EPS for the   quarters and six month periods ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , earnings, as reported for each respective period, is divided by: 

Share Repurchases 
  On February 25, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to   $200,000   worth of shares of our common stock, executable over two years. We completed this program during the quarter ended October 2, 2016.  On August 25, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to   $100,000   worth of our common stock, executable through March 31, 2018. The shares may be purchased from time to time in open market, block purchase, or negotiated transactions, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The repurchase authorization also allows us to make repurchases under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the quarters ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , we repurchased   1,074,489   shares for   $44,290   and   689,893   shares for   $31,110  , respectively.  During the   six months ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , we repurchased   1,536,014   shares for   $66,567   and   1,201,707   shares for   $54,018  , respectively. Since the inception of the programs through   October 2, 2016  , we have repurchased   4,877,100   shares for   $215,637  .  
  Any additional repurchases would be subject to market conditions and our compliance with our debt covenants.

  4. Acquisitions 

Acquisition of Camp Chef 
    
  On September 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of privately owned Logan Outdoor Products, LLC and Peak Trades, LLC ("Camp Chef"), a leading provider of outdoor cooking solutions. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid   $60,000  , subject to customary working capital adjustments, utilizing cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility.  An additional   $4,000   has been deferred and will be paid in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversary of the closing date and   $10,000   will be payable if incremental profitability growth milestones are met and key members of Camp Chef management continue their employment with us.  The   $10,000   will be expensed over the three-year measurement period and paid at each milestone date. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to further refinement and may require significant adjustments to arrive at the final purchase price allocation. A majority of the goodwill generated in this acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.  Camp Chef is an immaterial acquisition to our company. 
    
  Acquisition of Action Sports 
    
  On April 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of BRG Sports Inc. s Action Sports division, operated by Bell Sports Corp. The acquisition includes brands Bell, Giro, Blackburn, CoPilot, Krash, and Raskullz.  Under the terms of the transaction, we paid   $400,000  , subject to customary working capital adjustments, utilizing cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities, and additional contingent consideration payable if incremental profitability growth milestones within the Bell Powersports product line are achieved. We determined a value of the future contingent consideration as of the acquisition date of   $4,272   utilizing the Black Scholes option pricing model; the total amount paid may differ from this value. The option pricing model requires us to make assumptions including the risk-free rate, expected volatility, cash flows, and expected life. The risk-free rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term that approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected option life is based on the contractual term of the agreement.  Expected volatility is based on the average volatility of similar public companies' stock over the past three years.  The discounted cash flows are based on our estimates of future performance of the business.  
    
  Action Sports remains headquartered in Scotts Valley, California and operates facilities in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. The acquisition of Action Sports includes more than   600   employees worldwide. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to further refinement and may require significant adjustments to arrive at the final purchase price allocation. A portion of the goodwill generated in this acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes. 
    
  Acquisition of CamelBak Products 
    
  On August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of CamelBak Products, LLC ("CamelBak") for total consideration of   $412,500  , subject to a customary working capital adjustment, utilizing cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. CamelBak is the leading provider of personal hydration solutions for outdoor, recreation and military use. CamelBak s products include hydration packs, reusable bottles and individual purification and filtration systems.  CamelBak has approximately   300   employees worldwide. The purchase price allocation was completed during the   quarter ended     October 2, 2016  . A portion of the goodwill generated in this acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.   
    
  Acquisition of Jimmy Styks 
    
  On July 20, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Jimmy Styks, LLC ("Jimmy Styks"), using   $40,000   of cash on hand with additional contingent consideration payable if incremental profitability growth milestones are achieved over the next three years. We determined a value of the future contingent consideration as of the acquisition date of   $4,471   utilizing the Black Scholes option pricing model; the total amount paid may differ from this value. The option pricing model requires us to make assumptions including the risk-free rate, expected volatility, cash flows, and expected life. The risk-free rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term that approximates the expected life assumed at the date of grant. The expected option life is based on the contractual term of the agreement.  Expected volatility is based on the average volatility of similar public companies' stock over the past three years.  The discounted cash flows are based on our estimates of future performance of the business.  As of   October 2, 2016  , the value of the future contingent consideration was   $1,075  . The reduction from the original estimate was primarily a result of not achieving the first growth milestone.

  4. Acquisitions (Continued) 

The purchase price allocation was completed during the   quarter ended     October 2, 2016  . The majority of the goodwill generated in this acquisition will be deductible for tax purposes.  Jimmy Styks is an immaterial acquisition to our company. 
    
  Current quarter results for acquisitions 
    
  For the   quarter and six months ended     October 2, 2016  , Vista Outdoor recorded sales of approximately   $106,396   and   $240,466   and gross profit of approximately   $31,953   and   $74,282  , associated with the operations of these acquired businesses for periods in which they were not part of Vista Outdoor in the comparable prior year periods. Vista Outdoor recorded sales of approximately   $24,370   for the   quarter and six months ended     October 4, 2015   and gross profit of approximately   $9,216   for the   quarter and six months ended     October 4, 2015   associated with the operations of these acquired businesses. The results are reflected in the Outdoor Products segment results. 
    
  Bushnell acquisition settlement 
    
  During the   quarter ended     October 2, 2016  , we finalized a settlement of claims that we brought against the previous owner of Bushnell Holdings and third party insurance providers relating to certain disputes arising under the purchase agreement with respect to the acquisition.  A settlement was reached in which we received a total of   $30,027   net of current period litigation costs associated with the claims.  Separately, in accordance with the purchase agreement, we paid the previous owner for certain tax deductions in the amount of   $7,136  , which were taken on the final pre-acquisition income tax return of Bushnell Holdings.  
    
  Allocation of Consideration Transferred to Net Assets Acquired for Action Sports and CamelBak:  
    
  The following amounts represent the preliminary determination of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the Action Sports acquisition and the final determination for the CamelBak acquisition. The final determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities for Action Sports will be completed within the required measurement period, which will be no later than 12 months from the date of acquisition. The size and breadth of the Action Sports acquisition will necessitate the use of this measurement period to adequately analyze and assess a number of the factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition date, including the significant contractual and operational factors underlying the trade name and customer relationship intangible assets and the related tax impacts of any changes made. Any potential adjustments made could be material in relation to the preliminary values presented below:

Supplemental Pro Forma Data for Action Sports and CamelBak:  
    
  We used the acquisition method of accounting to account for these acquisitions and, accordingly, the results of Action Sports and CamelBak are included in our consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the date of acquisition. The following unaudited supplemental pro forma data for the   quarter and six months ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   present consolidated information as if the CamelBak acquisition had been completed on April 1, 2014 and the Action Sports acquisition had been completed on April 1, 2015. The pro forma results were calculated by combining our results with the standalone results of Action Sports and CamelBak for the pre-acquisition periods, which were adjusted to account for certain costs which would have been incurred during this pre-acquisition period:  

The unaudited supplemental pro forma data above include the following significant non-recurring adjustments made to account for certain costs which would have been incurred if the CamelBak acquisition had been completed on April 1, 2014 and the Action Sports acquisition had been completed on April 1, 2015, as adjusted for the applicable tax impact: 

(1) Adjustment reflects the increased cost of goods sold expense resulting from the fair value step-up in inventory of   $817   for Action Sports and   $1,043   for CamelBak which was expensed over the first inventory cycle. 
  (2) We removed the fees that were incurred in connection with the acquisition of Action Sports from fiscal 2017 and considered those fees as incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.  Costs were recorded in Selling, general, and administrative expense. We have incurred total of   $2,837   in fees in connection with the acquisition of Action Sports during fiscal 2016 and 2017. We removed the fees that were incurred in connection with the acquisition of CamelBak from fiscal 2016 and considered those fees as incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2015.

  The goodwill recorded within Outdoor Products and Shooting Sports segments are presented net of   $47,791   and   $41,020   of accumulated impairment losses, respectively. 
  Net intangibles consisted of the following:  

The gross amount of amortizing and non-amortizing intangible assets increased from March 31, 2016 due to the acquisitions of Action Sports and Camp Chef.  The assets in the table above are being amortized using a straight-line method over a weighted average remaining period of approximately   12.8 years  . Amortization expense for the   quarters and six month periods ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   was   $10,287   and   $8,349   and   $20,393   and   $15,651  , respectively. We expect amortization expense related to these assets to be as follows:

We provide consumer warranties against manufacturing defects on certain products within the Outdoor Products and Shooting Sports segments with warranty periods ranging typically from one year to a lifetime.  The estimated costs of such product warranties are recorded at the time the sale is recorded based upon actual past experience, our current production environment as well as specific and identifiable warranties as applicable.  The warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated liability for warranty coverage for products delivered based on historical information and current trends. The following is a reconciliation of the changes in our product warranty liability during the period presented:

10. Long-term Debt  
  Long-term debt, including the current portion, consisted of the following: 

Credit Agreement 
    
  On April 1, 2016, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  2016 Credit Agreement ), which replaced our 2014 Credit Agreement. The 2016 Credit Agreement is comprised of a Term A Loan of   $640,000   and a   $400,000   Revolving Credit Facility, both of which mature on April 1, 2021. The Term A Loan is subject to quarterly principal payments of   $8,000  , with the remaining balance due on April 1, 2021. Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either the sum of a base rate plus a specified margin or the sum of a Eurodollar rate plus a specified margin. Each margin is based on our consolidated leverage ratio, as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement. Based on the ratio in effect as of   October 2, 2016  , the base rate margin was   0.75%   and the Eurodollar margin was   1.75%  . The weighted average interest rate for our borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement as of   October 2, 2016   was   2.30%  . We pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility based on our consolidated leverage ratio, and based on the current ratio, this fee is   0.30%  . As of   October 2, 2016  , we had   $160,000   in borrowings against our   $400,000   Revolving Credit Facility and had outstanding letters of credit of   $28,429  , which reduced amounts available on the Revolving Credit Facility to   $211,571  .  
    
  With the exception of assets owned by the legal entities operating the Action Sports and Camp Chef businesses, substantially all domestic tangible and intangible assets of Vista Outdoor and its subsidiaries, as well as the tangible and intangible assets of Advanced Arrow S. de R.L. de C.V. and Hydrosport, S. de R.L. de C.V., are pledged as collateral under the 2016 Credit Agreement.  The domestic tangible and intangible assets of Action Sports and Camp Chef are expected to be pledged as collateral during fiscal 2017. Debt issuance costs of approximately   $12,000   are being amortized over the term of the 2016 Credit Agreement.  
    
  In fiscal 2014, we entered into a credit agreement (the "2014 Credit Agreement"), which was comprised of a Term A Loan of   $350,000   and a Revolving Credit Facility of   $400,000  , both of which were to mature on February 9, 2020. During the quarter ended July 3, 2016, we refinanced this agreement as noted above. In connection with this transaction, we wrote off   $1,521   of unamortized deferred debt issuance costs in the quarter ended July 3, 2016. 
    
  5.875% Notes 
    
  On August 11, 2015, we issued   $350,000   aggregate principal amount of   5.875%   Senior Notes (the "5.875% Notes") that mature on October 1, 2023. These notes are unsecured and senior obligations. Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, starting on April 1, 2016. We have the right to redeem some or all of these notes from time to time on or after October 1, 2018, at specified redemption prices. Prior to October 1, 2018, we may redeem some or all of these notes at a price equal to   100%   of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption and a specified make-whole premium. In addition, prior to October 1, 2018, we may redeem up to   35%   of the aggregate principal amount of these notes with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings, at a price equal to   105.875%   of

their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Debt issuance costs of approximately   $4,300   are being amortized to interest expense over 8 years, the term of the notes. 
    
  Rank and Guarantees 
    
  The 2016 Credit Agreement obligations are guaranteed on a secured basis, jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries, with the exception of the legal entities operating the Action Sports and Camp Chef businesses, and by Advanced Arrow S. de R.L. de C.V. and Hydrosport, S. de R.L. de C.V., as described above.  Vista Outdoor (the parent company issuer) has no independent assets or operations. We own 100% of all of these guarantor subsidiaries.  The 5.875% Notes are senior unsecured obligations and will rank equally in right of payment with any future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness. The 5.875% Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by our existing and future domestic subsidiaries that guarantee indebtedness under our 2016 Credit Agreement or that guarantee certain of our other indebtedness, or indebtedness of any subsidiary guarantor, in an aggregate principal amount in excess of   $50,000  . These guarantees are senior unsecured obligations of the applicable subsidiary guarantors.  The guarantee by any subsidiary guarantor of our obligations in respect of the 5.875% Notes will be released in any of the following circumstances: 

if, as a result of the sale of its capital stock, such subsidiary guarantor ceases to be a restricted subsidiary; 
                
    if such subsidiary guarantor is designated as an  Unrestricted Subsidiary;   
                
    upon defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the 5.875% Notes; or 
                
    if such subsidiary guarantor has been released from its guarantees of indebtedness under the 2016 Credit Agreement and all capital markets debt securities. 
       
  The guarantee by any subsidiary guarantor of our obligations in respect of the 2016 Credit Agreement will be released in any of the following circumstances: 

if, as a result of the sale of its capital stock, such subsidiary guarantor ceases to be a subsidiary; 
                
     if such subsidiary guarantor ceases to be a Domestic Subsidiary; or 
                
     upon repayment of all obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement. 
       
  Cash Paid for Interest on Debt 
    
  Cash paid for interest on debt, including commitment fees, for the   six months ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   totaled   $21,629   and   $4,683  , respectively. 
   
  11. Employee Benefit Plans 
  The total expense for employee benefit plans for the   quarter and six months ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   was   $1,690   and   $1,825  , and   $3,381   and   $3,650   respectively. 
  Employer Contributions.    During the   six months ended     October 2, 2016  , we made the legally required minimum contribution of   $2,200   directly to the pension trust, and   no   contributions to our other postretirement benefit plans.  We made distributions of   $12   directly to retirees under the non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan. During the   six months ended     October 4, 2015  , we made   no   contributions directly to the pension trust or to our other postretirement benefit plans, and no distributions to retirees under the non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan.  We also expect to contribute an additional   $2,200   directly to the pension trust and approximately   $174   to our other postretirement benefit plans, and distribute approximately   $688   directly to retirees under our supplemental executive retirement plans during the remainder of fiscal   2017  . 
   
  12. Income Taxes 
  Our provision for income taxes includes federal, foreign, and state income taxes. Income tax provisions for interim periods are based on estimated effective annual income tax rates.  
    
  The income tax provisions for the   quarters ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   represent effective tax rates of   22.4%   and   39.7%  , respectively. The   decrease   in the rate from the prior year quarter is primarily caused by a nontaxable acquisition claim settlement gain and settlement of the examination by the IRS of the fiscal 2013 and 2014 tax returns in the current quarter.

  12. Income Taxes (Continued) 

The income tax provision for the   six months ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   represent effective tax rates of   27.7%   and   39.8%  , respectively. The decrease in the rate from the prior year period is primarily caused by a nontaxable acquisition claim settlement gain and settlement of the examination by the IRS of the fiscal 2013 and 2014 tax returns in the current period. 
    
  We entered into a Tax Matters Agreement with Orbital ATK that governs the respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of Vista Outdoor and Orbital ATK after the distribution of all of the shares of our common stock on a pro rata basis to the holders of Alliant Techsystems Inc. common stock (the  Spin-Off ) with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state, local and foreign income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. We have joint and several liability with Orbital ATK to the IRS for the consolidated U.S. federal income taxes of the Orbital ATK consolidated group relating to the taxable periods in which we were part of that group. However, the Tax Matters Agreement specifies the portion, if any, of this tax liability for which we bear responsibility, and Orbital ATK agrees to indemnify us against any amounts for which we are not responsible. The Tax Matters Agreement also provides special rules for allocating tax liabilities in the event that the Spin-Off is determined not to be tax-free. Though valid as between the parties, the Tax Matters Agreement is not binding on the IRS.  
    
  Prior to the Spin-Off, Orbital ATK or one of its subsidiaries filed income tax returns in the U.S. federal and various U.S. state jurisdictions which included Vista Outdoor. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries filed income tax returns in foreign jurisdictions. After the Spin-Off we are filing income tax returns in the U.S. federal, foreign and various U.S. state jurisdictions. With a few exceptions, Orbital ATK and its subsidiaries and Vista are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities prior to 2009. The IRS has completed the audits of Orbital ATK through fiscal year 2014. The IRS is currently auditing our tax return for the period that begins after the Spin-Off (February 9, 2015) and ends on March 31, 2015. We believe appropriate provisions for all outstanding issues relating to our portion of these returns have been made for all remaining open years in all jurisdictions. 
  Although the timing and outcome of audit settlements are uncertain, it is reasonably possible that a   $2,472   reduction of the uncertain tax benefits will occur in the next 12 months. The settlement of these unrecognized tax benefits could result in earnings from   $0   to   $1,700  . 
   
  13. Contingencies 
  Litigation.      From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings, including lawsuits, which arise out of, and are incidental to, the conduct of our business. We do not consider any of such proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to our business or likely to result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. 
  Environmental Liabilities.      Our operations and ownership or use of real property are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of hazardous materials, remediation of contaminated sites, and restoration of damage to the environment. We are obligated to conduct investigation and/or remediation activities at certain sites that we own or operate or formerly owned or operated. 
  We also have been identified as a potentially responsible party ( PRP ), along with other parties, in a regulatory agency action associated with hazardous waste sites.  As a PRP, we may be required to pay a share of the costs of the investigation and clean-up of these sites.  While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities, based on currently available information, we have concluded that these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.  We have recorded a liability for environmental remediation of   $765   as of   October 2, 2016   and   March 31, 2016  .  
  We could incur substantial additional costs, including cleanup costs, resource restoration, fines, and penalties or third-party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations or liabilities under environmental laws or non-compliance with environmental permits. While environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows in the past, and we have environmental management programs in place to mitigate these risks, it is difficult to predict whether they will have a material impact in the future.

14. Condensed Consolidating Financial Statements  
    
  The 5.875% Notes are guaranteed on an unsecured basis, jointly and severally and fully and unconditionally by substantially all of our domestic subsidiaries, with the exception of the legal entities operating the Action Sports and Camp Chef businesses, and by Advanced Arrow S. de R.L. de C.V. and Hydrosport, S. de R.L. de C.V.  
    
  The parent company has no independent assets or operations. All of these guarantor subsidiaries are 100% owned by Vista Outdoor. These guarantees are senior or senior subordinated obligations, as applicable, of the applicable subsidiary guarantors. In conjunction with the registration of the 5.875% Notes the consolidating financial information of the guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries is presented on the following pages. 
    
  The guarantee by any subsidiary guarantor of our obligations in respect of the 5.875% Notes will be released in any of the following circumstances: 
    
      if, as a result of the sale of its capital stock, such subsidiary guarantor ceases to be a restricted subsidiary; 
      if such subsidiary guarantor is designated as an  Unrestricted Subsidiary;   
      upon defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the 5.875% Notes; or 
             
     if such subsidiary guarantor has been released from its guarantees of indebtedness under the Credit Agreement and all capital markets debt securities.

Management reviews the operating segments based on net sales and gross profit.  Certain significant selling, general, and administrative expenses are not allocated to the segments. In addition certain significant asset balances are not readily identifiable with individual segments and therefore cannot be allocated.  Each segment is described below:

  Financial highlights for the quarter ended   October 2, 2016    
             
    Quarterly sales were   $684,312   and   $551,377   for the quarters ended   October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively.  The increase is due to the acquisition of Action Sports, CamelBak, Camp Chef and Jimmy Styks, and increases in Shooting Sports and organic growth in the Outdoor Products segment. 

Gross Profit was   $185,409   and   $149,024   for the   quarters ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  , respectively. The increase is due to the acquisition of Action Sports, CamelBak, Camp Chef and Jimmy Styks, and an increase in Shooting Sports partially offset by an organic decline in the Outdoor Products segment. 

We finalized a settlement of claims that we brought against the previous owner of Bushnell Holdings and third party insurance providers relating to certain disputes arising under the purchase agreement with respect to the acquisition.  A settlement was reached in which we received a total of $30,027 net of current period litigation costs associated with the claims.  

The decrease in the current quarter's tax rate to   22.4%   from   39.7%   in the   quarter ended     October 4, 2015   was primarily caused by a nontaxable acquisition claim settlement gain and settlement of the examination by the IRS of the fiscal 2013 and 2014 tax returns in the current quarter.

Other notable events affecting fiscal   2017 

On April 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of BRG Sports Inc. s Action Sports division, operated by Bell Sports Corp. The acquisition includes brands Bell, Giro, Blackburn, CoPilot, Krash, and Raskullz.  Under the terms of the transaction, we paid   $400,000  , subject to customary working capital adjustments, utilizing cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities and additional contingent consideration payable if incremental profitability growth milestones within the Bell Powersports product line are achieved.  

On September 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of privately owned Logan Outdoor Products, LLC and Peak Trades, LLC ("Camp Chef"), a leading provider of outdoor cooking solutions. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid $60,000, subject to customary working capital adjustments, utilizing cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility.  An additional $4,000 has been deferred and will be paid in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversary of the closing date and $10,000 will be payable if incremental profitability growth milestones are met and key members of Camp Chef management continue their employment with us.  The $10,000 will be expensed over the measurement period and paid at each milestone date.  

Outlook 
    
  The current year has seen an increase in the number of new long-gun background checks as evidenced by The National Instant Criminal Background Check System.  This increase, along with higher sales on a year-over-year basis within Shooting Sports indicates that this market has stabilized.  
    
  We still see a challenging retail environment in the second half of the year, and promotional activity is likely to continue in the markets in which we participate.  
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Our critical accounting policies are described in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016  .  We believe our critical accounting policies are those related to: 

revenue recognition, 
                
    allowance for doubtful accounts, 
                
    inventories, 
                
    income taxes, 
                
    acquisitions, and 
                
    accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles. 
       
  The accounting policies used in preparing our interim fiscal   2017   consolidated financial statements are the same as those described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

  Acquisition of Camp Chef 
    
  On September 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of privately owned Logan Outdoor Products, LLC and Peak Trades, LLC ("Camp Chef"), a leading provider of outdoor cooking solutions. Under the terms of the transaction, we paid $60,000, subject to customary working capital adjustments, utilizing cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facility.  An additional $4,000 has been deferred and will be paid in equal installments on the first, second and third anniversary of the closing date and $10,000 will be payable if incremental profitability growth milestones are met and key members of Camp Chef management continue their employment with us.  The $10,000 will be expensed over the measurement period and paid at each milestone date.  
    
  Acquisition of Action Sports 
    
  On April 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of BRG Sports Inc. s Action Sports division, operated by Bell Sports Corp. The acquisition includes brands Bell, Giro, Blackburn, CoPilot, Krash, and Raskullz.  Under the terms of the transaction, we paid   $400,000   in cash, subject to customary working capital adjustments, and additional contingent consideration payable if incremental profitability growth milestones within the Bell Powersports product line are achieved. We determined a value of the future contingent consideration as of the acquisition date of   $4,272   utilizing the Black Scholes option pricing model; the total amount paid may differ from this value. Action Sports remains headquartered in Scotts Valley, California and operates facilities in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. The acquisition of Action Sports includes more than   600   employees worldwide. 
    
  Acquisition of CamelBak Products 
    
  On August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of CamelBak Products, LLC ("CamelBak") for total consideration of   $412,500  , subject to a customary working capital adjustment, utilizing cash on hand and borrowings under our existing credit facilities. CamelBak is the leading provider of personal hydration solutions for outdoor, recreation and military use. CamelBak s products include hydration packs, reusable bottles and individual purification and filtration systems.  CamelBak has approximately 300 employees worldwide. 
    
  Acquisition of Jimmy Styks 
    
  On July 20, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Jimmy Styks, LLC ("Jimmy Styks"), using   $40,000   of cash on hand with additional contingent consideration payable if incremental profitability growth milestones are achieved over the next three years. We determined a value of the future contingent consideration as of the acquisition date of   $4,471   utilizing the Black Scholes option pricing model; the total amount paid may differ from this value.  Jimmy Styks is a leading designer and marketer of stand up paddle boards and related accessories. Jimmy Styks  stand up paddle board portfolio provides easy-to-use platforms for water sport enthusiasts engaging in activities ranging from personal fitness to fishing and will help us expand our Outdoor Products operating segment. Jimmy Styks offers nearly 30 SKUs in epoxy, inflatable, soft and thermoform boards, as well as accessories. As of   October 2, 2016  , the value of the future contingent consideration was   $1,075  . The reduction from the original estimate was primarily a result of not achieving the first growth milestone. 
  Sales 
   One customer contributed   15%   of our sales for the   six months ended     October 2, 2016   and one customer contributed 11% of our sales for the   six months ended     October 4, 2015  . No other single customer contributed more than 10% of our sales for the   six months ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   .

Net Interest Expense 

Quarter Ended 
  The   increase   was due to our debt balances being higher than the prior year period, driven by borrowings for the previously mentioned acquisitions, as well as a higher average interest rate on debt. 
  Six Months Ended 
  The   increase   was due to our debt balances being higher than the prior year period, driven by borrowings for the previously mentioned acquisitions, as well as a higher average interest rate on debt and the write off of deferred financing fees.  
  Income Tax Provision 

Our provision for income taxes includes U.S. federal, foreign, and state income taxes. Income tax provisions for interim periods are based on estimated effective annual income tax rates. 
  Quarter Ended 
  The income tax provisions for the   quarters ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   represent effective tax rates of   22.4%   and   39.7%  , respectively.  The   decrease   in the rate from the prior year quarter is primarily caused by a nontaxable acquisition claim settlement gain and settlement of the examination by the IRS of the fiscal 2013 and 2014 tax returns in the current quarter.  
    
  Six Months Ended 
    
  The income tax provision for the   six months ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   represent effective tax rates of   27.7%   and   39.8%  , respectively. The decrease in the rate from the prior year period is primarily caused by a nontaxable acquisition claim settlement gain and settlement of the examination by the IRS of the fiscal 2013 and 2014 tax returns in the current period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We manage our business to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to cash on hand and cash generated by operations, sources of liquidity include a committed credit facility and access to the public debt and equity markets. We use our cash to fund investments in our existing core businesses and for debt repayment, share repurchases, and acquisitions or other activities. 
  Cash Flow Summary 
  Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the   six months ended October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015   are summarized as follows: 

Operating Activities  . 
  Net cash   provided by   operating activities was   $10,183   compared to   $17,495   in the prior year period, a change of   $7,312  .  The change from the prior year period was primarily a result of increased working capital in the current period, partially offset by the receipt of cash related to the settlement of claims related to the Bushnell acquisition. The change in working capital was driven by timing of payments and collections. 
  Investing Activities  . 
  Net cash   used for   investing activities was   $489,200   compared to   $479,268   in the prior year period, a change of   $9,932  .  The change is primarily driven by an increase in capital expenditures due to our ammunition capacity expansion project.  
  Financing Activities. 
  Net cash   provided by   financing activities was   $375,818  , compared to   $284,506   in the prior year period, a change of   $91,312  .  This change was primarily due to an increase in the amount of debt issued to fund our acquisitions. 
  Liquidity 
  In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, debt repayments, employee benefit obligations, share repurchases, and any strategic acquisitions. Our short-term cash requirements for operations are expected to consist mainly of capital expenditures to maintain and expand production facilities and working capital requirements. Our debt service requirements over the next two years consist of principal and interest payments due under the 2016 Credit Agreement, as well as interest payments on the 5.875% Notes, as discussed further below. 
  Based on our current financial condition, management believes that our cash position, combined with anticipated generation of cash flows and the availability of funding, if needed, through our 2016 Credit Agreement, access to debt and equity markets, as well as potential future sources of funding including additional bank financing, will be adequate to fund future growth as well as to service our currently anticipated long-term debt and pension obligations and make capital expenditures over the next 12 months.  
  We do not expect that our access to liquidity sources will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, will not be materially impacted by capital market conditions.

Long-Term Debt and Credit Agreement 
  As of   October 2, 2016  , we had total indebtedness of   $1,134,000  , which consisted of the following: 

Our total debt (current portion of debt and long-term debt) as a percentage of total capitalization (total debt and stockholders' equity) was   40.0%   as of   October 2, 2016  . 
  See Note 9, "Long-Term Debt", to the consolidated and combined financial statements filed on Form 8-K on August 11, 2016 for fiscal   2016   for a detailed discussion of the 5.875% Notes, and Note 10 to the condensed consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this 10-Q for detailed discussion of the 2016 Credit Agreement. 
  Covenants 
  Credit Agreement 
  Our 2016 Credit Agreement imposes restrictions on us, including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, enter into capital leases, grant liens, pay dividends and make certain other payments, sell assets, make loans and investments, or merge or consolidate with or into another entity. In addition, the 2016 Credit Agreement limits our ability to enter into sale-and-leaseback transactions. The 2016 Credit Agreement allows us to make unlimited "restricted payments" (as defined in the 2016 Credit Agreement), which, among other items, allows payments for future share repurchases and dividends, as long as we maintain a certain amount of liquidity and maintain certain debt limits. When those requirements are not met, the limit under the 2016 Credit Agreement is equal to $150,000 plus proceeds of any equity issuances plus 50% of net income since February 9, 2015.  
    
  The 2016 Credit Agreement contains financial covenants that require us to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 3.00 to 1.00 and to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of 3.50 to 1.00 or less. Our financial covenant ratios as of   October 2, 2016   were as follows: 
                           
    Interest Coverage Ratio* 
      
    Leverage 
  Ratio  
      Requirement 
    3.00 

3.50 
      
      Actual 
    10.23 

2.86 
      
      * Not to be below the required financial ratio 

Not to exceed the required financial ratio 

The Leverage Ratio is the sum of our total debt plus financial letters of credit and surety bonds, net of up to $75,000 of cash, divided by Covenant EBITDA (which includes adjustments for items such as non-recurring or extraordinary non-cash items, non-cash charges related to stock-based compensation, and intangible asset impairment charges, as well as inclusion of EBITDA of acquired companies on a pro forma basis) for the past four fiscal quarters. The Interest Coverage Ratio is Covenant EBITDA divided by pro forma interest expense (excluding non-cash charges).

     Table of Contents  

5.875% Notes 
  The indenture governing the 5.875% Notes contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur or permit to exist certain liens, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of assets, consolidate, amalgamate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, enter into transactions with affiliates, enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries  ability to pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem our capital stock, prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt and make loans and investments. 
  The 2016 Credit Agreement and the indenture governing the 5.875% Notes contain cross-default provisions so that non-compliance with the covenants within one debt agreement could cause a default under other debt agreements as well. As of   October 2, 2016  , we were in compliance with the covenants and expect to be in compliance for the foreseeable future. However, our business, financial position and results of operations are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including some that may be beyond our control, and we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to comply with all such financial covenants in the future. For example, during periods in which we experience declines in net income, we may not be able to comply with such financial covenants. Any failure to comply with the restrictions in the 2016 Credit Agreement may prevent us from drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility and may result in an event of default under the 2016 Credit Agreement, which default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related indebtedness and proceed against the collateral that secures the indebtedness. We may not have sufficient liquidity to repay the indebtedness in such circumstances. 
  Share Repurchases 
  On August 25, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $100,000 worth of shares of our common stock, executable through March 31, 2018. The shares may be purchased from time to time in open market, block purchase, or negotiated transactions, subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The repurchase authorization also allows us to make repurchases under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We completed our previously approved $200,000 repurchase program during the quarter ended October 2, 2016.  During the   six months ended     October 2, 2016   and October 4, 2015, we repurchased   1,536,014   shares for   $66,567   and   1,202,000   shares for   $54,018  , respectively.  Since the inception of the programs through   October 2, 2016  , we have repurchased   4,877,100   shares for   $215,637  .  
  Any additional repurchases would be subject to market conditions and our compliance with our debt covenants, as described above.  
  Other Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
    
  Other than the additional debt noted previously, there have been no material changes with respect to the contractual obligations and commitments or off-balance sheet arrangements described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal   2016  . 
  Contingencies 
  Litigation.      From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings, including lawsuits, which arise out of, and are incidental to, the conduct of our business. We do not consider any of such proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to our business or likely to result in a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. 
  Environmental Liabilities.      Our operations and ownership or use of real property are subject to a number of federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as applicable foreign laws and regulations, including those governing the discharge of hazardous materials, remediation of contaminated sites, and restoration of damage to the environment. We are obligated to conduct investigation and/or remediation activities at certain sites that we own or operate or formerly owned or operated. 
  We also have been identified as a PRP, along with other parties, in regulatory agency actions associated with hazardous waste sites.  As a PRP, we may be required to pay a share of the costs of the investigation and clean-up of these sites.  While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities, based on currently available information, we have concluded that these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.  
  We could incur substantial additional costs, including cleanup costs, resource restoration, fines, and penalties or third-party property damage or personal injury claims, as a result of violations or liabilities under environmental laws or non-compliance with environmental permits. While environmental laws and regulations have not had a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows in the past, and we have environmental management programs in place to mitigate these risks, it is difficult to predict whether they will have a material impact in the future.

New Accounting Pronouncements 
  See Note 1, "Basis of Presentation and Responsibility for Interim Financial Statements," to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in Item 1 of Part I of this report. 
  Dependence on Key Customers; Concentration of Credit 
  The loss of any key customer and our inability to replace revenues provided by a key customer may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.   One   customer contributed   15%   of our sales for the   six months ended     October 2, 2016   and   one   customer contributed   11%   of our sales for the   six months ended     October 4, 2015  . No other single customer contributed more than 10% of our sales for the   six months ended     October 2, 2016   and   October 4, 2015  . 
   If a key customer fails to meet payment obligations, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
  Inflation and Commodity Price Risk 
  In management s opinion, inflation has not had a significant impact upon the results of our operations. However, we have been impacted by changes in the prices of raw materials used in production as well as changes in oil and energy costs. In particular, the prices of commodity metals, such as copper, zinc, and lead continue to be volatile. These prices generally impact our Shooting Sports Segment.  
  We have a strategic sourcing and price strategy to mitigate risk from commodity price fluctuation. We will continue to evaluate the need for future price changes in light of these trends, our competitive landscape, and our financial results. If our sourcing and pricing strategy is unable to offset impacts of the commodity price fluctuations, our future results from operations and cash flows would be materially impacted.  
   
  ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates. To mitigate the risks from interest rate exposure, we may enter into hedging transactions, mainly interest rate swaps, through derivative financial instruments that have been authorized pursuant to corporate policies. We may use derivatives to hedge certain interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate, and commodity price risks, but do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes, and we are not a party to leveraged financial instruments. Additional information regarding the financial instruments is contained in Note 1 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Our objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to limit the impact of such changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower the overall borrowing costs. 
  We measure market risk related to holdings of financial instruments based on changes in interest rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis measures the potential loss in fair values, cash flows, and earnings based on a hypothetical change (increase and decrease) in interest rates. We used current market rates on the debt portfolio to perform the sensitivity analysis. Certain items such as lease contracts, insurance contracts, and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits were not included in the analysis. 
  We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, the British Pound, the Chinese Renminbi (Yuan), the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses  operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. To mitigate the risks from foreign currency exposure, we may enter into hedging transactions, mainly foreign currency forward contracts, through derivative financial instruments that have been authorized pursuant to corporate policies. 
  In addition, sales and expenses of our non-U.S. businesses are also translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects.

ITEM 4.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of   October 2, 2016  , our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) and have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. These disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  During the quarter ended   October 2, 2016   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings, including lawsuits, which arise out of, and are incidental to, the conduct of our business. Notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings in any particular quarter, we do not consider any of such proceedings that are currently pending, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to our business or likely to result in a material adverse effect on our future operating results, financial condition, or cash flows. 
  We also have been identified as a PRP, along with other parties, in regulatory agency actions associated with hazardous waste sites.  As a PRP, we may be required to pay a share of the costs of the investigation and clean-up of these sites.  While uncertainties exist with respect to the amounts and timing of the ultimate environmental liabilities, based on currently available information, we do not currently expect that these matters, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, or cash flows.  
  The description of certain environmental laws and regulations contained in Part I, Item 2, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" under the heading "Contingencies" is incorporated herein by reference. 
   
  ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
  While we attempt to identify, manage and mitigate risks and uncertainties associated with our business to the extent practical under the circumstances, some level of risk and uncertainty will always be present. Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   March 31, 2016   describes the known material risks and uncertainties associated with our business. These risks and uncertainties have the potential to materially affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, projected results, and future prospects.
