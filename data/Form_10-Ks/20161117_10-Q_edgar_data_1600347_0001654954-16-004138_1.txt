NOTES
TO INTERIM CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1. The Company History and Nature of the Business 

Hotapp
International Inc, formerly Fragmented Industry Exchange Inc, (the
 Company  or  Group ) was incorporated in
the State of Delaware on March 7, 2012 and established a fiscal
year end of December 31. The Company s initial business plan
was to be a financial acquisition intermediary which would serve
buyers and sellers for companies that are in highly fragmented
industries. The Company determined it was in the best interest of
the shareholders to expand its business plan. On October 15, 2014,
through a sale and purchase agreement (the  Purchase
Agreement ) the Company acquired all the issued and
outstanding stock of HotApps International Pte Ltd (the
 HIP ) from Singapore eDevelopment Limited
( SeD ). HIP owned certain intellectual property
relating to instant messaging for portable devices (the
 HotApp ). HotApp is a cross-platform mobile
application that incorporates instant messaging and ecommerce. It
provides a messaging and calling services for HotApp users (text,
photo, audio). HotApp can be used on any mobile platform (i.e. IOS
Online or Android). 

Pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued SED 1,000,000 shares
of common stock and 13,800,000 shares of newly created convertible
preferred stock. See Note 8 for further description. 

As of
September 30, 2016, details of the Company s subsidiaries are

The
financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America applicable for a
going concern, which assumes that the Company will realize its
assets and discharge its liabilities in the ordinary course of
business. Since inception, the Company has incurred net losses of
$4,276,896 and has net working capital deficit of $424,943 at
September 30, 2016.   Accordingly, these factors
raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern.   These financial
statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or
amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from
this uncertainty.  Our ability to continue as a going
concern is dependent upon achieving sales growth, management of
operating expenses and ability of the Company to obtain the
necessary financing to meet its obligations and pay its liabilities
arising from normal business operations when they come due, and
upon profitable operations. 

Our
majority shareholder has advised us not to depend solely on it, for
financing. We have increased our efforts to raise additional
capital through equity or debt financings from other
sources.    However, we cannot be certain that such
capital (from our shareholders or third parties) will be available
to us or whether such capital will be available on terms that are
acceptable to us.   Any such financing likely would
be dilutive to existing stockholders and could result in
significant financial operating covenants that would negatively
impact our business.  If we are unable to raise
sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have
insufficient funds to operate our business or pursue our planned
growth. 

Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

Basis of presentation 

The
condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015 was
derived from audited financial statement but does not include all
disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in
the United States of America. The other information in these
condensed financial statements is unaudited but, in the opinion of
management, reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation of the results for the periods covered. All such
adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed
otherwise. These condensed financial statements, including notes,
have been prepared in accordance with the applicable rules of the
Securities and   Exchange Commission
and do not include all of the information and disclosures required
by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America for complete financial statements. These condensed
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and additional information as contained in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015. 

7 

Basis of consolidation 

The
consolidated financial statements of the Group include the
financial statements of Hotapp International Inc and its
subsidiaries.  All inter-company transactions and
balances have been eliminated upon consolidation. 

Use of estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and revenues, cost
and expenses in the financial statements and accompanying notes.
Significant accounting estimates reflected in the Group s
consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, the
useful lives and impairment of property and equipment, valuation
allowance for deferred tax assets and share-based
compensation. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid
investments, which are unrestricted from withdrawal or use, or
which have original maturities of three months or less when
purchased. 

Foreign currency risk 

Because
of its foreign operations, the Company holds cash in non-US
dollars.   As of September 30, 2016, cash and cash
equivalents of the Group includes, on an as converted basis to US
dollars $31,003, $41,110 and $23,818 in Hong Kong Dollars
( HK$ ), Reminbi ( RMB ) and Singapore
Dollars ( S$ ), respectively. 

The
Renminbi ( RMB ) is not a freely convertible
currency.   The State Administration for Foreign
Exchange, under the authority of the People s Bank of China,
controls the conversion of RMB into foreign currencies. The value
of the RMB is subject to changes in central government policies and
to international economic and political developments affecting
supply and demand in the China Foreign Exchange Trading System
market. 

Concentration of credit risk 

Financial
instruments that potentially expose the Group to concentration of
credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash
equivalents.  The Group places their cash with financial
institutions with high-credit ratings and quality. 

Fixed assets, net 

Property
and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the
following estimated useful lives: 

Office
equipment 

3
years 

Computer
equipment 

3
years 

Furniture
and fixtures 

3
years 

Motor
vehicles 

10
years 

Fair value 

Fair
value is the price that would be received from selling an asset or
paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. When determining the
fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or
permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Group considers the
principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact
and it considers assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability. 

Revenue recognition 

The Group recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed
or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. The
Group currently has $55,887 revenue from its services rendered on
projects, and plans to derive its revenue from membership
subscription services, offering the platform for Enterprise
Collaboration with integration. Revenue is currently recognized
under contract accounting due to the significant software
production required, and the percentage-of-completion method is
used in accordance with ASC 605-35. The Company is recognizing the
percentage-of-completion based on output measures that measured
directly from results achieved, and management reviews the progress
to completion.  

8 

Research and development expenses 

Research
and development expenses primarily consist of (i) salaries and
benefits for research and development personnel, and
(ii) office rental, general expenses and depreciation expenses
associated with the research and development
activities.  The Company s research and development
activities primarily consist of the research and development of new
features for its mobile platform and its self-developed mobile
games. Expenditures incurred during the research phase are expensed
as incurred. 

Income taxes 

Current
income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the
relevant tax authorities.  Deferred income taxes are
recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
consolidated financial statements. Net operating loss carry
forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is
more-likely-than-not that a portion of or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The components of the deferred tax
assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and
non-current based on their characteristics. 

The
impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return
is recognized at the largest amount that is more-likely-than-not to
be sustained upon audit by the relevant tax authority. An uncertain
income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a
50% likelihood of being sustained.  Interest and
penalties on income taxes will be classified as a component of the
provisions for income taxes. The Group did not recognize any income
tax due to uncertain tax position or incur any interest and
penalties related to potential underpaid income tax expenses for
the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014,
respectively. 

Uncertainties
exist with respect to the application of the New EIT Law to our
operations, specifically with respect to our tax
residency.  The New EIT Law specifies that legal entities
organized outside of the PRC will be considered residents for PRC
income tax purposes if their  de facto management
bodies  as  establishments that carry on substantial
and overall management and control over the operations, personnel,
accounting, properties, etc. of the
Company.   Because of the uncertainties that have
resulted from limited PRC guidance on the issue, it is uncertain
whether our legal entities outside the PRC constitute residents
under the New EIT Law.  If one or more of our legal
entities organized outside the PRC were characterized as PRC
residents, the impact would adversely affect our results of
operations. 

Foreign currency translation 

The
functional and reporting currency of the Company is the United
States dollar ( U.S. dollar ). The financial records of
the Company s subsidiaries located in Singapore, Hong Kong
and the PRC are maintained in their local currencies, the Singapore
Dollar (S$), Hong Kong Dollar (HK$) and Renminbi ("RMB"),
which are also the functional currencies of these
entities. 

Monetary
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the
functional currency are translated into the functional currency at
the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency
during the year are converted into functional currency at the
applicable rates of exchange prevailing when the transactions
occurred.   Transaction gains and losses are
recognized in the statement of operations. 

The
Company s entities with functional currency of Renminbi, Hong
Kong Dollar and Singapore Dollar, translate their operating results
and financial positions into the U.S. dollar, the Company s
reporting currency. Assets and liabilities are translated using the
exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. Revenues,
expenses, gains and losses are translated using the average rate
for the year. Translation adjustments are reported as cumulative
translation adjustments and are shown as a separate component of
comprehensive income (loss). 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded other
comprehensive loss from translation loss of $121,484 in the
consolidated financial statements. 

Operating leases 

Leases
where the rewards and risks of ownership of assets primarily remain
with the lessor are accounted for as operating leases. Payments
made under operating leases are charged to the consolidated
statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease
periods. 

Comprehensive income (loss) 

Comprehensive
income (loss) includes gains (losses) from foreign currency
translation adjustments. Comprehensive income (loss) is reported in
the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive
loss. 

9 

Loss per share 

Basic
loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to
shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding
during the period. 

The
Company's convertible preferred shares are not participating
securities and have no voting rights until converted to common
stock.   As of September 30, 2016, no shares of
preferred stock are eligible for conversion into voting common
stock. 

Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted 

In May
2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606) (ASU 2014-09), which amends the existing
accounting standards for revenue recognition. In August 2015, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, which delays the
effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. The FASB also agreed to
allow entities to choose to adopt the standard as of the original
effective date. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to
have a significant effect on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In
November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No.
2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of
Deferred Taxes (ASU 2015-17), which simplifies the presentation of
deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and
liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The
updated standard is effective for us beginning on January 1, 2017.
We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a
significant effect on our consolidated financial
statements. 

Note 3.  FIXED ASSETS, NET 

Fixed
assets, net consisted of the following: 

Depreciation
expenses charged to the consolidated statements of operations for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $35,121 and
$25,683 respectively. 

A motor
vehicle has been sold to  an affiliate
of Singapore eDevelopment Limited  ( SeD ) for a
consideration of $93,678. 

Note 4.  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED
EXPENSES 

Accrued
expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the
following: 

10 

Note 5.  INCOME TAXES 

The
provision for income taxes for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, was as follows (assuming a 15% effective tax
rate): 

The
Company provided a valuation allowance equal to the deferred income
tax assets for period ended September 30, 2016 because it is not
presently known whether future taxable income will be sufficient to
utilize the loss carry-forwards. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately $4,276,896
in net operating loss carry-forwards that can be utilized in future
periods to reduce taxable income, and expire by the year
2035.  The Company did not identify any material
uncertain tax positions.  The Company did not recognize any
interest or penalties for unrecognized tax
benefits.  

The
federal income tax returns of the Company are subject to
examination by the IRS, generally for three years after they are
filed.   The tax returns for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are still subject to examination
by the taxing authorities. 

Note 6.  SHARE CAPITALIZATION 

The
Company is authorized to issue 500 million shares of common stock
and 15 million shares of preferred stock.  Both share
types have a $0.0001 par value.  As of September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company had issued and outstanding, 5,909,687 of
common stock, respectively and 13,800,000 shares of preferred
stock, respectively. 

Common Shares: 

On July
13, 2015, SED acquired 777,687 shares of the Company common stock
by converting outstanding loans made to the Company into common
stock of the Company at a rate of $5.00 per share (rounded to the
nearest full share). After such transactions SED owned 98.17% of
the Company. 

Preferred Shares: 

Pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, dated October 15, 2014, the Company
issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock to
SED.   Such amount represented 19% ownership in the
Company.  Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, dated October
15, 2014, the Company issued 13,800,000 shares of a class of
preferred stock called Perpetual Preferred Stock ( Preferred
Stock ) to SED. The Preferred Stock has no dividend or voting
rights. The Preferred Stock is convertible to common stock of the
Company dependent upon the number of commercial users of the
Software. For each 1,000,000 commercial users of the Software
(without duplication), SED shall have the right to convert
1,464,000 shares of Perpetual Preferred Stock into 7,320,000 shares
of Common Stock, so that there must be a minimum of 9,426,230
commercial users in order for all of the shares of the Perpetual
Preferred Stock to be converted into common stock of the Company
(13,800,000 shares of Preferred Stock convertible into 69,000,000
shares of common stock). 

Other
than the conversion rights described above, the Preferred Stock has
no voting, dividend, redemption or other rights.

Background 

Hotapp
International Inc, formerly Fragmented Industry Exchange Inc, (the
 Company  or  Group ) was incorporated in
the State of Delaware on March 7, 2012 and established a fiscal
year end of December 31. The Company s initial business plan
was to be a financial acquisition intermediary which would serve
buyers and sellers for companies that are in highly fragmented
industries. The Company determined it was in the best interest of
the shareholders to expand its business plan. On October 15, 2014,
through a sale and purchase agreement (the  Purchase
Agreement ) the Company acquired all the issued and
outstanding stock of HotApps International Pte Ltd (the
 HIP ) from Singapore eDevelopment Limited
( SeD ). HIP owned certain intellectual property
relating to instant messaging for portable devices (the
 HotApp ). HotApp is a cross-platform mobile
application that incorporates instant messaging and ecommerce. It
provides a messaging and calling services for HotApp users (text,
photo, audio). HotApp can be used on any mobile platform (i.e. IOS
Online or Android). 

Pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued SED 1,000,000 shares
of common stock and 13,800,000 shares of newly created convertible
preferred stock. See Note 8 for further description.

The
Group has relied significantly on SeD as its principal sources of
funding during the year. The Board has, in the meantime, reviewed
and approved the restructuring of HotApp which has since reduced
personnel to 10 currently from 40 previously. HotApp has revamped
its business model and technology platform to focus on
business-to-business ( B2B ) services, built around
enterprise communications and workflow. Its product line will
target these industries: (i) network and direct marketing; (ii)
enterprise Voice-over-IP; (iii) enterprise messaging; (iv) real
estate; (v) social media; (vi) e-commerce; (vii) investor
relations; (viii) healthcare and wellness; and (ix) hospitality,
combining HotApp applications with hotel-room management. This
strategic shift is intended to create commercial value with a
sharper focus.

Our Business 

Our
software application ( HotApp ) is a community
communications ecosystem (the  Platform ), connecting
users who wish to seek out both local and global communities
( Users  or  Communities ) and equipping
them with necessary tools to communicate effectively across
borders. HotApp will monetize the relationship between brands,
Online-2-Offline ( O2O ) operators and service
providers (collectively,  Enterprises ) and the HotApp
Communities, and in the process mediate something of value to both
parties. By targeting communities beyond demographics (ie. topical
interest, common activities) Enterprises will be able to create
targeted marketing campaigns with the expectation of higher
conversion rates. The respective features of HotApp like HotNearby
and HotChat and HotRoom enable peer to peer buying decision
influence more effectively compared to generic social media. HotApp
business partners actually have reason to believe they can market
their product or service as a solution to the customer and their
marketing network. 

With
our platform users can discover and build their own communities and
create valuable content. Our platform tools empower these
communities to share their thoughts and words across multiple
channels. As these communities grow, they provide the critical mass
that attracts enterprises. Enterprises in turn enhance user
experience with premium contents, all of which are facilitated by
the transactions of every stakeholder via e-commerce. 

Trends in the Market and Our Opportunity 

Mobile
phone messaging apps will be used by more than 1.4 billion
consumers in 2015, up 31.6% on the previous year according to
eMarketer s forecast for these services. 

Worldwide, that
means 75% of smartphone users will use an over-the-top (OTT) mobile
messaging app at least once a month in 2015. 

The
growth in popularity of messaging apps is projected to continue,
and eMarketer predicts that by 2018, the number of chat app users
worldwide will reach 2 billion and represent 80% of smartphone
users. 

Based
upon the above trends, we believe significant opportunities
exist for: 

Enterprise
deploying messaging platform to effective engage different
stakeholders 

Continuing growth
in demand for OTT Services encapsulated within a single mobile app
with a clear intent and objectives fulfilling the communication
need for specific communities and industries. 

Enterprises to
increase usage of OTT Services, such as adoption of Enterprise
messaging Apps alongside with using of Email, video and audio
conferencing, collaboration through cloud services, as a new medium
for different stakeholder engagement including customers, to
promote and market their products and services. HotApp s
approach in white labelling for the enterprises will augment and
fill this demand in the market. 

O2O operations has
been identified as an integral aspect of HotApp s e-commerce
and monetization plans. As such HotApp will continue to develop and
explore partnerships to exploit such O2O operations. 

Our Plan of Operations and Growth Strategy 

We
believe that we have significant opportunities to further enhance
the value we deliver to our Users.    We intend
to pursue the following growth strategy: 

Position HotApp as
an open platform to be ready for integration with third party
technology partnerships such as Payment Services, Loyalty Programs,
e-commerce; 

Engage
Mobile App Integration Opportunities for Enterprises globally
through  Powered by HotApp  initiatives, enabling
Offline businesses to go On Line (O2O) with HotApp technology
support 

Identify Strategic
Partnership Opportunities globally through  Powered by
HotApp  initiatives, enabling Offline businesses to go On
Line (O2O) with HotApp technology support 

Establish
community and business partnerships (collectively,  HotApp
Partnerships ) to expand our user base and
engagement.

September 30, 2016, we had cash of $105,951 and working capital
deficit of $424,943.  Cash had decreased during the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 primarily due to operating losses
incurred during the first half of the year. 

We had
a total stockholders  deficit of $347,108 and an accumulated
deficit of $4,276,896 as of September 30, 2016 compared with a
total stockholders  equity of $363,092 and an accumulated
deficit of $3,688,180 as of December 31,
2015.   This difference is primarily due to the net
loss incurred during the first half of the year. 

15 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a net loss of
$588,716. We made a positive adjustment of $35,121 due to
depreciation and a negative adjustment of $120,588 due to foreign
currency transaction gain. We had a positive change of $24,750 due
to prepaid expenses and a positive change of $7,036 due to accrued
taxes payable. We had a negative change of $125,051 due to accounts
payable and accrued expenses and a positive change of $272,850 due
to amount due to related parties. We had a positive change of
$20,632 due to deferred revenue. As a result, we had net cash used
in operating activities of $473,966 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a net loss of
$1,971,092. We made a positive adjustment of $25,683 due to
depreciation and a negative adjustment of $5,782 due to foreign
currency transaction gain. We had a negative change of $108,087 due

payable. As a result, we had net cash used in operating activities
of $2,114,009 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received $94,410 on the
disposal of fixed assets, resulting in net cash provided by
investing activities of $85,677 for the period. 

For the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, we spent $151,082 on the
acquisition of fixed assets, resulting in net cash used in
investing activities of $151,082 for the period. 

For the

of $423,153, resulting in net cash used in financing activities of
$335,819 for the period. 

As of
September 30, 2016, we have fixed operating office lease agreements
for Guangzhou s office amounting to US$11,578 from 2016 to
2017, and Hong Kong s office amounting to US$17,108 from 2016
to 2017. 

We will
need to raise additional capital through equity or debt financings.
However, we cannot be certain that such capital (from SED or third
party) will be available to us or whether such capital will be
available on a term that is acceptable to us. Any such financing
likely would be dilutive to existing shareholders and could result
in significant financial and operating covenants that would
negatively impact our business. If we are unable to raise
sufficient additional capital on acceptable terms, we will have
insufficient funds to operate our business and pursue our business
plan. 

Consistent
with Section 144 of Delaware General Corporation Law, it is our
current policy that all transactions between us and our officers,
directors and their affiliates will be entered into only if such
transactions are approved by a majority of the disinterested
directors, are approved by vote of the stockholders, or are fair to
us as corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or
ratified by the board. We will conduct an appropriate review of all
related party transactions on an ongoing basis. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of
operations are based upon the Company s financial statements,
which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ).
The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. We believe that the estimates,
assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies
described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial
statements, so we consider these to be our critical accounting
policies. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters,
actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying
the critical accounting policies. Certain of these critical
accounting policies affect working capital account balances,
including the policies for revenue recognition, allowance for
doubtful accounts, inventory reserves and income taxes. These
policies require that we make estimates in the preparation of our
financial statements as of a given date. 

Within
the context of these critical accounting policies, we are not
currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances
that would result in materially different amounts being
reported. 

Revenue recognition 

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed
or determinable, and collectability is reasonably
assured.    The Group currently has $55,887
revenue from its services rendered on projects and plans to derive
its revenue from membership subscription services, offering the
platform for mobile games developed by third parties and other
services, including the use of the paid emoticons and mobile
marketing services. Revenue is currently recognized under contract
accounting due to the significant software production required, and
the percentage-of-completion method is used in accordance with ASC
605-35. The Company is recognizing the percentage-of-completion
based on output measures that measured directly from results
achieved, and management reviews
progress-to-completion.  

Research and development expenses 

Research
and development expenses primarily consist of (i) salaries and
benefits for research and development personnel, and
(ii) office rental, general expenses and depreciation expenses
associated with the research and development
activities.  The Company s research and development
activities primarily consist of the research and development of new
features for its mobile platform and its self-developed mobile
games. Expenditures incurred during the research phase are expensed
as incurred. 

16 

Income taxes 

Current
income taxes are provided for in accordance with the laws of the
relevant tax authorities.  Deferred income taxes are
recognized when temporary differences exist between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the
consolidated financial statements. Net operating loss carry
forwards and credits are applied using enacted statutory tax rates
applicable to future years. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is
more-likely-than-not that a portion of or all of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The components of the deferred tax
assets and liabilities are individually classified as current and
non-current based on their characteristics. 

Uncertainties
exist with respect to the application of the New EIT Law to our
operations, specifically with respect to our tax
residency.  The New EIT Law specifies that legal entities
organized outside of the PRC will be considered residents for PRC
income tax purposes if their  de facto management
bodies  as  establishments that carry on substantial
and overall management and control over the operations, personnel,
accounting, properties, etc. of the
Company.   Because of the uncertainties resulted
from limited PRC guidance on the issue, it is uncertain whether our
legal entities outside the PRC constitute residents under the New
EIT Law.  If one or more of our legal entities organized
outside the PRC were characterized as PRC residents, the impact
would adversely affect our results of operations.

issuer s other certifying officers and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as

for the small business issuer and have: 

a) 

  Designed such
disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure

ensure that material information relating to the small business
issuer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to
us by others within those entities, particularly during the period

internal controls over financial reporting which are reasonably
likely to adversely affect the small business issuer s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial

or not material, that involves management or other employees who
have a significant role in the small business issuer s
