Note 1.   Description of Business  

Business Overview  

Applied Optoelectronics, Inc., or AOI, was
originally incorporated in Texas in February of 1997 and then converted to a Delaware corporation in March of 2013. AOI together
with its wholly-owned subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the Company. The Company is a leading, vertically integrated
provider of fiber-optic networking products, primarily for four networking end-markets: internet data centers, cable television,
fiber-to-the-home and telecommunications. The Company designs and manufactures a wide range of optical communications products
at varying levels of integration, from components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment. 

The Company has manufacturing and research
and development facilities located in the U.S., Taiwan and China. At its corporate headquarters and manufacturing facilities in
Sugar Land, Texas, the Company primarily manufactures lasers and laser components and performs research and development activities
for laser component and optical module products. The Company operates in Taipei, Taiwan and Ningbo, China through its wholly-owned
subsidiary Prime World International Holdings, Ltd. (incorporated in the British Virgin Islands). Prime World International Holdings,
Ltd. is the parent of Global Technology, Inc. (incorporated in the People s Republic of China). Through Global Technology
Inc., the Company primarily manufactures certain of our data center transceiver products, including subassemblies, as well as Cable
TV Broadband ( CATV ) systems and equipment, and performs research and development activities for the CATV products.
The Company also operates a division, AOI-Taiwan, which primarily manufactures transceivers for both the data center and fiber-to-the-home
( FTTH ) markets and performs research and development activities for the transceiver products. The Company recently
contributed to Prime World International Holdings, Ltd., the Company's business assets, liabilities and contracts relating to AOI Taiwan.
Upon approval by the Department of Commerce, Ministry of Economic Affairs of Taiwan, AOI Taiwan will operate as a Taiwan
branch of Prime World International Holdings, Ltd. The Company also has an additional research and development center in Lawrenceville,
Georgia. The Company s research and development functions are partnered with its manufacturing locations. 

Interim Financial Statements  

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and September 30, 2015, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( GAAP ) for interim information and with the instructions on Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In accordance with those rules
and regulations, the Company has omitted certain information and notes required by GAAP for annual consolidated financial statements.
In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, except as otherwise noted,
necessary for the fair presentation of the Company s financial position and results of operations for the periods presented.
The year-end condensed balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K ( Annual Report ) for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the entire fiscal
year. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results
could differ from those estimates in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates and assumptions
that impact these financial statements and the accompanying notes relate to, among other things, allowance for doubtful accounts,
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, inventory reserve, share-based compensation expense, estimated useful lives of property
and equipment, and taxes. 

Note 2.   Significant Accounting Policies  

There have been no changes in the Company s
significant accounting policies for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the significant accounting
policies described in its 2015 Annual Report, except as described below. 

Income Taxes  

At the end of each interim period, the Company
makes its best estimate of the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. This estimate reflects, among
other items, the Company s best estimate of operating results and foreign currency exchange rates. The Company s quarterly
income tax rate may differ from its estimated annual effective tax rate because accounting standards require the Company to exclude
the actual results of certain entities expected to generate a pretax loss when applying the estimated annual effective tax rate
to the Company s consolidated pretax results in interim periods. In estimating the annual effective tax rate, the Company
does not include the estimated impact of unusual and/or infrequent items, including the reversal of certain valuation allowances,
which may cause significant variations in the customary relationship between income tax expense (benefit) and pretax income (loss)
in quarterly and year-to-date periods. The income tax expense (benefit) for such unusual and/or infrequent items is recorded in
the quarterly period such items are incurred. 

The Company routinely reviews valuation
allowances recorded against deferred tax assets on a more likely than not basis in evaluating whether the Company has the ability
to realize the deferred tax assets. In making such a determination, the Company takes into consideration all available and appropriate
positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income, future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences,
available tax planning strategies and taxable income in prior carryback years, if available. Considering these factors, a possibility
exists that the Company may record or release a portion of a valuation allowance against some deferred tax assets each quarterly
period, which could create volatility in the Company s future effective tax rate. 

The Company recorded an income tax benefit
of $11.3 million and $11.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and an income tax provision
of $0.4 million and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The income tax benefit for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes the release of $11.9 million of the Company s existing valuation
allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets and additional foreign, U.S. federal, and state income tax expenses. The Company
considered all available positive and negative evidence in making a determination to release a portion of its existing valuation
allowance. Such evidence included, among others, the Company s history of profitability and losses, jurisdictional income
recognition trends, forecasted income by jurisdiction and three years of cumulative taxable income in the U.S. federal tax jurisdiction
as of September 30, 2016. 

Therefore, the Company determined that there
is sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it is more likely than not that it will utilize its U.S. deferred tax assets.
As a result of the valuation allowance release, a deferred tax asset of $11.9 million is reflected on the accompanying condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. The related $11.9 million effect on the accompanying condensed consolidated
statement of operations for the fiscal period ended September 30, 2016 is a non-cash income tax benefit. 

The Company s income tax expense and
resulting effective tax rate are based upon the respective estimated annual effective tax rates applicable for the respective periods
adjusted for the effects of items required to be treated as discrete to the period, including changes in the aforementioned valuation
allowance, stock option expenses due to disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options, changes in tax laws, changes in estimated
exposures for uncertain tax positions and other items. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the following areas: accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies; classifying excess tax benefits
on the statement of cash flows; accounting for forfeitures; classifying awards that permit share repurchases to satisfy statutory
tax withholding requirements; classifying tax payments on behalf of employees on the statement of cash flows; and, for nonpublic
entities only, determining the expected term and electing the intrinsic value measurement alternative for stock option awards.
The new guidance is effective for public business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and in the interim
periods within those fiscal years. The guidance requires a mix of prospective, modified retrospective and retrospective transition.
The Company is evaluating the impact of the accounting standard on its financial statements. 

On February 25, 2016, the FASB released
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,  Leases  to complete its project to overhaul lease accounting. The ASU codifies
ASC 842, Leases, which will replace the guidance in ASC 840.  The new guidance will require
lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet for capital and operating leases. The new guidance is effective for public
business entities in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.  The Company is evaluating the impact of the accounting
standard on its financial statements. 

The FASB  issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial
Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The
new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The ASU affects public and private
companies, not-for-profit organizations, and employee benefit plans that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. The
new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. The Company is evaluating the impact of the accounting standard on its financial statements. 

The FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  during November 2015 ,  which simplifies the presentation
of deferred income taxes. This ASU provides presentation requirements to classify deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent
in a statement of financial position. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim
periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted for any interim and annual financial statements that have not
yet been issued. The ASU may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all
periods presented. The Company early adopted this standard effective December 31, 2015 on a retrospective basis which resulted
in a reclassification of our net current deferred tax asset to the net non-current deferred tax asset as of December 31, 2015.
The adoption of this ASU had no impact on the balance sheet or income statement as the Company had a full valuation allowance as
of December 31, 2015. 

The FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Inventory
 in July 2015 to require entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Market could be replacement cost, net realizable
value, or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin. The Company early adopted this ASU which had no material
impact on the financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,
 Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,  which requires
the presentation of debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of
that debt liability. ASU 2015-03 does not address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit
arrangements. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit
arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently
amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there
are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company early adopted this ASU which had no material impact
on the financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).  The amendments in ASU 2015-14 defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09
for all entities by one year. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only
as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.
The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the accounting standard on its financial statements. The Company plans to adopt
the new standards after December 15, 2017. 

Note 3.   Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The following table presents a summary of
the Company s financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

The carrying value amounts of accounts receivable,
prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate fair value
because of the short-term maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the term loans approximate fair value due to the
variable interest rates. 

Note 4.   Earnings Per Share  

Basic net income per share has been computed
using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share has been
computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock and dilutive potential common shares from stock options and
restricted stock units/awards outstanding during the period. 

The following table sets forth the computation
of the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts): 

There were no securities that were excluded
from the computation of diluted net income per share. 

Note 5.   Inventories  

Inventories, net of inventory writedowns,
consist of the following for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

The lower of cost or market adjustment expensed
for inventory for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.9 million for each period. The lower of cost or market
adjustment expensed for inventory for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2.8 million and $2.2 million, respectively.

respectively. 

Included in depreciation expense was $2.1
million and $1.4 million recorded as cost of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included
in depreciation expense was $6.0 million and $3.8 million recorded as cost of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
there was $167,000 and $121,000 of capitalized interest recorded in construction in progress and building, respectively. 

Note 7.   Intangible Assets, net  

Intangible assets consisted of the following
for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, amortization expense for intangible assets, included in general and administrative expenses on the income statement,
was $115,000 and $104,000, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, amortization expense for intangible
assets, included in general and administrative expenses on the income statement, was $337,000 and $305,000, respectively. 

The remaining weighted average amortization
period for intangible assets is approximately 9 years. 

Note 8.   Notes Payable and Long-Term Debt  

Notes payable and long-term debt consisted
of the following for the periods indicated (in thousands): 

The current portion of long-term
debt is the amount payable within one year of the balance sheet date of September 30, 2016. The one-month London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR)  was 0.4939% on September 30, 2016. 

Maturities of long-term debt are as follows
for the future one-year periods ending September 30 (in thousands): 

On June 24, 2016, the Company entered into
a First Amendment to its Credit Agreement with East West Bank and Comerica Bank ( First Amendment ), a second lien
deed of trust, multiple security agreements and promissory notes evidencing two credit facilities and a term loan originally entered
into on June 30, 2015. The First Amendment increased the Company s revolving lines of credit from $25 million to $40 million,
which mature on June 30, 2018, and retains a $10.0 million term loan maturing on June 30, 2020. The First Amendment also provides
for an additional $10.0 million equipment term loan with a one year drawdown period commencing on April 1, 2016 and maturing five
years from the closing date of the First Amendment. The interest rate on these loans was lowered by the First Amendment from the
LIBOR Borrowing Rate plus 2.75% or 3.0% to LIBOR Borrowing Rate plus 2.0%. As of September 30, 2016, $30.0 million was outstanding
under the revolving line of credit. As of September 30, 2016, $9.8 million was outstanding under the term loan. 

The Company also has a term loan with
East West Bank of $5.0 million with monthly payments of principal and interest that matures on July 31, 2019. As of September
30, 2016, the outstanding balance was $3.2 million. 

On June 24, 2016, the Company executed
a Change in Terms Agreement, Notice of Final Agreement and Modification of the Construction Loan Agreement
( Modification Agreement ) to its Construction Loan Agreement with East West Bank for up to $22.0 million dollars
to finance the construction of the Company s campus expansion plan in Sugar Land, Texas, originally dated January 26,
2015. Upon signing the original Construction Loan Agreement, the Company deposited $11.0 million into a restricted bank
account for owner s contribution of construction costs. The Modification Agreement has a fifteen month draw down period
with monthly interest payments commencing on February 26, 2015 and ending on July 31, 2016. Thereafter, the entire
outstanding principal balance shall be converted to a sixty-six month term loan with principal and interest payments due
monthly amortized over three hundred months. The first principal and interest payment commenced on August 26, 2016, and
continue the same day of each month thereafter. The final principal and interest payment is due on January 26, 2022 and will
include all unpaid principal and all accrued and unpaid interest. The Company may pay without penalty all or a portion of the
amount owed earlier than due. Under the Construction Loan Agreement, the loan bears interest at an annual rate based on the
one-month LIBOR Borrowing Rate plus 2.75%, and the interest rate is reduced to LIBOR Borrowing Rate plus 2.0% under the

Modification Agreement. The draw down period end date, under the Second Modifications, is amended from July 31, 2016 to September
30, 2016. And thereafter, the entire outstanding principal balance shall be converted to a sixty-four (64) month term loan, amended
from a sixty (66) month term loan, with principal and interest payments due monthly amortized over three hundred (300) months.
The first principal and interest payment is due on October 26, 2016 and will continue on the same day of each month thereafter.
The final principal and interest payment is due on January 26, 2022 and will include all unpaid principal and all accrued and unpaid
interest. Except as expressly changed by the Second Modifications, the terms of the original obligation and Modification Agreement
remain unchanged.

Overview  

We are a leading, vertically integrated
provider of fiber-optic networking products, primarily for four networking end-markets: internet data center, cable television,
or CATV, fiber-to-the-home, or FTTH, and telecommunication, or telecom. We design and manufacture a range of optical communications
products at varying levels of integration, from components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment. In designing
products for our customers, we begin with the fundamental building blocks of lasers and laser components. From these foundational
products, we design and manufacture a wide range of products to meet our customers  needs and specifications, and such products
differ from each other by their end market, intended use and level of integration. We are primarily focused on the higher-performance
segments within all four of our target markets, which increasingly demand faster connectivity and innovation. 

The four end markets we target are all driven
by significant bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network-connected devices, video traffic, cloud computing and online social
networking. To address this increased bandwidth demand, CATV and telecommunications service providers are competing directly against
each other by providing bundles of voice, video and data services to their subscribers and investing to enhance the capacity, reliability
and capability of their networks. The trend of rising bandwidth consumption also impacts the internet data center market, as reflected
in the shift to higher speed server connections. As a result of these trends, fiber-optic networking technology is becoming essential
in all four of our target markets, as it is often the only economic way to deliver the desired bandwidth. 

Our vertically integrated manufacturing
model provides us several advantages, including rapid product development, fast response times to customer requests and control
over product quality and manufacturing costs. We design, manufacture and integrate our own analog and digital lasers using a proprietary
Molecular Beam Epitaxy, or MBE, and Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition (MOCVD) fabrication process, which we believe is unique
in our industry. We manufacture the majority of the laser chips and optical components that are used in our products. The lasers
we manufacture are proven to be reliable over time and highly tolerant of changes in temperature and humidity, making them well-suited
to the CATV and FTTH markets where networking equipment is often installed outdoors. 

We have three manufacturing sites: Sugar
Land, Texas, Ningbo, China and Taipei, Taiwan. Our research and development functions are partnered with our manufacturing locations
and we have an additional research and development center in Lawrenceville, Georgia. In our Sugar Land facility, we manufacture
laser chips (utilizing our MBE process), subassemblies and components. The subassemblies are used in the manufacture of components
by our other manufacturing facilities or sold to third parties as modules. We manufacture our laser chips only within our Sugar
Land facility, where our laser design team is located. In our Taiwan location, we manufacture optical components, such as our butterfly
lasers, which incorporate laser chips, subassemblies and components manufactured within our U.S. facility. In addition, in our
Taiwan location, we manufacture transceivers for the internet data center, FTTH, telecom, and other markets. In our China facility,
we take advantage of lower labor costs and manufacture certain more labor intensive components and optical equipment systems, such
as optical subassemblies for the internet data center market, CATV transmitters (at the headend) and CATV outdoor equipment (at
the node). Each manufacturing facility conducts testing on the components, modules or subsystems it manufactures and each such
facility is certified to ISO 9001:2008. Our facilities in Ningbo, China, Taipei, Taiwan, and Sugar Land, TX are all certified
to ISO 14001:2004. 

Our sales model focuses on direct engagement
and close coordination with our customers to determine product design, qualifications, and performance through coordination of
our sales, product engineering and manufacturing teams. Our strategy is to use our direct sales force to sell to key accounts within
our markets, increasing product penetration within those customers while also growing our overall customer base in certain international
and domestic markets. We have direct sales personnel in each of our U.S., Taiwan and China locations focusing on a direct and local
interaction with our CATV, FTTH, telecom and internet data center customers. Throughout our sales cycle, we work closely with our
customers to achieve design wins that we believe provide long-lasting relationships and promote higher customer retention. 

Our principal executive offices are located
at 13139 Jess Pirtle Blvd., Sugar Land, TX 77478, and our telephone number is (281) 295-1800. 

Results of Operations  

The following table set forth our consolidated
results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of our revenue for those periods (in thousands): 

Comparison of Financial Results  

Revenue  

We generate revenue through the sale of
our products to equipment providers and network operators for the internet data center, CATV, FTTH and telecom markets. We derive
a significant portion of our revenue from our top ten customers, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so for the foreseeable
future. The following charts provide the revenue contribution from each of the markets we served for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

Growth
in the three months ended September 30, 2016 was driven primarily by increasing revenue from our internet data center customers,
and we also anticipate that our revenue derived from this market will continue to increase as a percentage of our revenue as we
further penetrate and extend our products into this market.  

During the third quarter of 2016 and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, revenues in the internet data center market were driven primarily by increasing demand for our
40 gigabits per second and 100 Gbps transceivers as our customers continued to upgrade their technology infrastructure, partially
offset by a decrease in demand for our older 10G products. The decrease in revenue in our FTTH market is due to a decline in demand
for certain older legacy products. Demand for these legacy products is expected to continue to fluctuate. The decrease in revenues
in the CATV market for the year was a result of lower demand from certain customers who resold our product into foreign markets
where currencies had weakened. The increase in revenue in our telecom market is due to increased sales of products that were introduced
within the last 12-18 months. These products are used in a variety of interconnect applications within telecom networks. 

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, our top ten customers represented 95.5% and 95.2% of our revenue, respectively. 

Cost of goods sold and gross margin  

Cost of goods sold increased by $7.9 million,
or 20.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due
to a 22.9% increase in sales over the prior year. The increase in gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the same period ended September 30, 2015 was primarily the result of lower production costs associated with certain 40G and
100G products, along with increased revenue from our CATV products. 

Operating expenses  

Research and development expense  

Research and development expense increased
by $3.0 million, or 55.3%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, research and development expense increased $9.7 million, or 65.0% as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to increases in personnel costs, R D work orders,
R D material usage and other project costs related to 40G and 100G data center products, DOCSIS 3.1-capable CATV products,
including remote-PHY products, and other new product development, and an increase in depreciation expense resulting from additional
R D equipment investments, and additional depreciation expenses related to our new building in Sugar Land. 

Sales and marketing expense  

Sales and marketing expense remained unchanged
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, sales and marketing expense increased $0.1 million as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
This increase was due to an increase in personnel costs offset by a decrease in commissions paid to sales personnel. 

General and administrative expense  

General and administrative expense increased
by $1.5 million, or 29.9%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expense increased by $3.6 million, or 24.7% as compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs, professional fees, share-based
compensation, and overhead costs associated with our new building in Sugar Land. 

Other income (expense), net  

Interest income decreased 51.2% for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and decreased 12.7% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to lower cash balances during the period. 

Interest expense increased 31.6% for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and increased 69.2% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This was due to borrowing activities to
fund the expansion projects, including the expansion of our Sugar Land facility. 

Other income (expense) increased
by $2.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period of the prior year due to
unrealized exchange gains resulting from the favorable fluctuation of certain Asian currencies against the U.S. dollar. Other
income (expense) increased by $1.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 due to a $5.9 million increase in unrealized gain resulting from the favorable fluctuation of
certain Asian currencies against the U.S. dollar, offset by a $4.9 million increase in realized exchange loss arising from
foreign currency transactions. $3.0 million of realized exchange loss was recognized when the company transferred assets
and liabilities of its Taiwan branch office to Prime World International Holding Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary. We
qualify as a high-tech enterprise in China, as determined by the Chinese government, and are paid subsidies from time to time
by the Chinese government to foster local high-tech manufacturing. We received $0.1 million of subsidies in each of the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.0 and $0.2 million for the same periods in 2015. 

Provision for income taxes  

We recorded an income tax benefit of $11.3
million and $11.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to a tax provision
of $0.4 million and $0.5 million for the three and nine months ended September, 2015, respectively. The income tax benefit recorded
in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was related to the release of the valuation allowance previously recorded
against deferred tax assets. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

From inception until our initial
public offering in September 2013, we financed our operations through private sales of equity securities, cash generated from
operations and from various lending arrangements. As of September 30, 2016, we had $24.1 million of unused borrowing capacity
from all of our loan agreements. As of September 30, 2016, our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term
investments totaled $60.2 million. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes and are invested primarily
in money market or time deposit funds. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. On October 17,
2016, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which was declared effective
on November 1, 2016, providing for the public offer and sale of certain securities of the Company from time to time, at our
discretion, up to an aggregate amount of $250 million. 

The table below sets forth selected cash
flow data for the periods presented (in thousands): 

Operating activities  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $28.4 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded
net income of $17.0 million. The net income included non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of $9.9 million,
share-based compensation expense of $2.8 million, non-cash increases to our inventory reserve account of $2.8 million,
deferred income tax benefit of $11.9 million from the release of our valuation allowance and an unrealized exchange gain of $3.5
million. Cash provided by operating activities primarily related to a $9.4 million decrease in inventory related to sales orders
and cash provided by the increase of accounts payable to our vendors of $3.9 million. These increases were offset by an increase
in our accounts receivable of $5.4 million from the sale of our products in excess of collection of trade receivables. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2015, net cash used in operating activities was $17.7 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded net
income of $8.1 million. The net income included non-cash charges, including depreciation and amortization of $6.7 million, share-based
compensation expense of $1.6 million and non-cash increases to our inventory reserve account of $2.2 million. Cash used
in operating activities was primarily related to a $30.6 million increase in inventory related to sales orders, an increase of
$9.8 million in our accounts receivable from the sale of our products, a decrease of $4.1 million in other current assets, offset
by $1.7 million of cash provided by an increase in accounts payable to our vendors. 

Investing activities  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, net cash used in investing activities was $31.9 million mainly for the purchase of additional machinery and equipment and
investment in construction of our U.S. plant of $40.3 million, offset by the maturity of short term investments of $7.7 million. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2015, net cash used in investing activities was $35.7 million, $31.9 million for the purchase of additional machinery and equipment
and investment in construction of our U.S. plant and $2.4 million used to increase deposits and deferred charges. 

Financing activities  

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, our financing activities provided $26.6 million in cash. We received $28.9 million in net long-term borrowings associated
with our bank loans, offset by $4.0 million of principal payment. In addition, we received net $1.3 million cash from our line
of credit facility and $0.3 million of net cash receipt from acceptances payable. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2015, our financing activities provided $59.0 million in cash. We received $21.8 million in net borrowings associated with
our bank loans, $2.0 million in net proceeds from acceptances payable, offset by increased restricted cash of $3.1 million related
to our bank loan requirements. We also received $38.7 million in net proceeds from our ATM Offering which was completed in August,
2015. 

Loans and commitments  

We have lending arrangements with several
financial institutions, including a revolving line of credit and a term loan with East West Bank and Comerica Bank in the U.S.,
lines of credit and financing agreements for our Taiwan branch and several lines of credit arrangements for our China subsidiary.
As of September 30, 2016, we had $24.1 million of unused borrowing capacity. 

On June 24, 2016, we entered into a First
Amendment to our Credit Agreement with East West Bank and Comerica Bank ( First Amendment ), a second lien deed of
trust, multiple security agreements and promissory notes evidencing two credit facilities and a term loan originally entered into
on June 30, 2015. The First Amendment increased our revolving lines of credit from $25 million to $40 million, which mature on
June 30, 2018, and retains a $10.0 million term loan maturing on June 30, 2020. The First Amendment also provides for an additional
$10.0 million equipment term loan with a one year drawdown period commencing on April 1, 2016 and maturing five years from the
closing date of the First Amendment. The interest rate on these loans was lowered by the First Amendment from the LIBOR Borrowing
Rate plus 2.75% or 3.0% to LIBOR Borrowing Rate plus 2.0%. As of September 30, 2016, $30.0 million was outstanding under the revolving
line of credit. As of September 30, 2016, $9.8 million was outstanding under the term loan. 

We also have a term
loan with East West Bank of $5.0 million with monthly payments of principal and interest that matures on July 31, 2019. As of September 30, 2016, the
outstanding balance was $3.2 million. 

On June 24, 2016, we executed a Change
in Terms Agreement, Notice of Final Agreement and Modification of the Construction Loan Agreement ( Modification
Agreement ) to our Construction Loan Agreement with East West Bank for up to $22.0 million dollars to finance the
construction of the Company s campus expansion plan in Sugar Land, Texas, originally dated January 26, 2015. Upon
signing the original Construction Loan Agreement, the Company deposited $11.0 million into a restricted bank account for
owner s contribution of construction costs. The Modification Agreement has a fifteen month draw down period with
monthly interest payments commencing on February 26, 2015 and ending on July 31, 2016. Thereafter, the entire outstanding
principal balance shall be converted to a sixty-six month term loan with principal and interest payments due monthly
amortized over three hundred months. The first principal and interest payment commenced on August 26, 2016, and continue the
same day of each month thereafter. The final principal and interest payment is due on January 26, 2022 and will include all
unpaid principal and all accrued and unpaid interest. We may pay without penalty all or a portion of the amount owed earlier
than due. Under the Construction Loan Agreement, the loan bears interest at an annual rate based on the one-month LIBOR
Borrowing Rate plus 2.75%, and the interest rate is reduced to LIBOR Borrowing Rate plus 2.0% under the Modification
Agreement. As of September 30, 2016, there was $21.8 million outstanding under this loan agreement and there was $0.8 million
in the restricted bank account. 

On September 27, 2016, we executed a Change
in Terms Agreement, Notice of Final Agreement and Second Modification to the Construction Loan Agreement ( Second Modifications )
to its Construction Loan Agreement with East West Bank. The Second Modifications amends and restates in part the Company s
Promissory Note and Construction Loan Agreement which was originally executed on January 26, 2015, and the Modification Agreement.
The draw down period end date, under the Second Modifications, is amended from July 31, 2016 to September 30, 2016. And thereafter,
the entire outstanding principal balance shall be converted to a sixty-four (64) month term loan, amended from a sixty (66) month
term loan, with principal and interest payments due monthly amortized over three hundred (300) months. The first principal and
interest payment is due on October 26, 2016 and will continue on the same day of each month thereafter. The final principal and
interest payment is due on January 26, 2022 and will include all unpaid principal and all accrued and unpaid interest. Except as
expressly changed by the Second Modifications, the terms of the original obligation and the Modification Agreement remain unchanged. 

The loan and security agreements with East
West Bank and Comerica Bank require us to maintain certain financial covenants, including a minimum cash balance, a current ratio,
a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all covenants
contained in these agreements. 

On February 19, 2016, our Taiwan branch
renewed and increased its credit facility originally dated January 6, 2015 with CTBC Bank Co. Ltd. in Taipei, Taiwan for 320 million
New Taiwan dollars, or approximately $10.3 million, one year revolving credit facility. The obligations under the credit facility
are unsecured up to $6.3 million; the remaining $4.0 million is available provided that we purchase the same amount of secured
certificates of deposit with the bank. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a rate based on the bank s corporate
interest rate index plus 1.5% for the unsecured portion of the credit facility and bank s corporate interest rate index plus
0.93% for the secured portion of the credit facility, adjusted monthly. As of the execution of the credit facility, the bank s
corporate interest rate index is 0.71%. As of September 30, 2016, no balance was outstanding for the secured loan and $6.3 million
was outstanding under this unsecured credit facility. 

On April 8, 2016, our Taiwan branch
renewed its 90 million New Taiwan dollars, or approximately $2.6 million, and 120 million New Taiwan dollars, or
approximately $4.0 million, one year revolving credit facilities, originally dated March 9, 2015, with E. Sun Commercial Bank
Co., Ltd. in Taipei, Taiwan. Borrowings under the 90 million New Taiwan dollars credit facility will bear interest at a rate
equal to the LIBOR plus 1.7% divided by 0.946. Borrowings under the 120 million New Taiwan
dollars credit facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the bank s personal monthly time deposit interest rate
plus 0.480%. Any future borrowings under the 120 million New Taiwan dollars credit facility are available provided that we
purchase certificates of deposit in amounts equal to the borrowing from the bank. As of September 30, 2016, we have no
balance outstanding under the 120 million New Taiwan dollars credit facility and we have $2.2 million outstanding under the
90 million New Taiwan dollars credit facility. 

On December 22, 2015, our Taiwan branch
renewed its $4.0 million credit facility, originally dated December 20, 2013, and entered into a $2.0 million, one year revolving
credit facility agreement with Mega International Commercial Bank ( Mega Bank ). Obligations under the $4.0 million
credit facility are available provided that we purchase certificates of deposit in amounts equal to the borrowing from Mega Bank.
Borrowings under the $4.0 million credit facility bear interest at a rate not less than the LIBOR borrowing rate plus 1.0%, divided
by 0.946 for U.S. and other currency borrowings; New Taiwan dollars borrowings bear interest at a rate equal to the bank s
base lending rate plus 0.76%. Borrowings under the $2.0 million credit facility bear interest at a rate not less than the LIBOR
borrowing rate plus 1.2%, divided by 0.946 for U.S. dollar borrowings; New Taiwan dollars borrowings bear interest at a rate equal
to the bank s base lending rate plus 0.76% but shall not be less than 1.90%; and other currency borrowings shall bear interest
at a rate at the bank s based lending rate plus 1.0%, divided by 0.946. As of September 30, 2016, $2.0 million was outstanding
under the unsecured credit facility and no balance was outstanding under the $4.0 million credit facility. 

On April 22, 2016, our Taiwan branch entered
into a Comprehensive Credit Line Agreement originally dated April 1, 2015, with the Taipei branch of China Construction Bank, providing
a revolving credit line of $10 million, maturing on March 15, 2017. Borrowings under the Comprehensive Credit Line Agreement are
secured by a standby letter of credit issued by the China branch of the bank under existing agreements between the bank and our
China subsidiary. Borrowings under the Comprehensive Credit Line Agreement reduce the amounts available under the existing credit
line between the bank and our China subsidiary and cannot exceed 97% of the amount of the standby letter of credit issued by the
China branch of the bank. Borrowings under the Comprehensive Credit Line Agreement bear interest at a rate negotiated separately
for each drawing depending on the nature of the borrowings. As of September 30, 2016, $6.9 million was outstanding under this credit
facility with interest rates at approximately 2.67%.. 

On June 30, 2015, our Taiwan branch entered
into a Purchase and Sale Contract and a Finance Lease Agreement with Chailease Finance Co, Ltd. ( Chailease ) in connection
with certain equipment, structured as a sale lease-back transaction. Pursuant to the sale contract, our Taiwan branch sold certain
equipment to Chailease for a purchase price of 115,240,903 New Taiwan dollars, approximately $3.7 million, and simultaneously leased
the equipment back from Chailease pursuant to the Finance Lease Agreement. The monthly lease payments range from 2,088,804 New
Taiwan dollars, approximately $0.1 million, to 2,364,650 New Taiwan dollars, approximately $0.1 million, during the term of the
Finance Lease Agreement, including an initial payment in an amount of 40,240,903 New Taiwan dollars, approximately $1.3 million.
The Finance Lease Agreement has a three year term, with monthly payments, maturing on May 27 and June 30, 2018 respectively. The
title to the equipment will be transferred to our Taiwan branch upon the expiration of the Finance Lease Agreement. As of September
30, 2016, $3.5 million was outstanding under this Finance Lease Agreement. 

On March 31, 2016, our Taiwan branch entered
into a Purchase and Sale Contract and a Finance Lease Agreement with Chailease in connection with certain equipment, structured
as a sale lease-back transaction. Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Contract, our Taiwan branch sold certain equipment to Chailease
for a purchase price of 312,927,180 New Taiwan dollars, approximately $10.1 million, and simultaneously leased the equipment back
from Chailease pursuant to the Finance Lease Agreement. The Finance Lease Agreement has a three year term with monthly lease payments
range from 6,772,500 New Taiwan dollars, approximately $0.2 million, to 7,788,333 New Taiwan dollars, approximately $0.3 million,
during the term of the Finance Lease Agreement, including an initial payment in an amount of 62,927,180 New Taiwan dollars, approximately
$2.0 million. Based on the payments made under the Finance Lease Agreement, the annual interest rate is calculated to be 4.0%.
The title to the equipment will be transferred to our Taiwan branch upon the expiration of the Finance Lease Agreement. As of September
30, 2016, $6.6 million was outstanding under this Finance Lease Agreement. 

As of September 30, 2016, our Chinese subsidiary
had credit facilities with China Construction Bank totaling $13.3 million, which can be drawn in U.S. currency, RMB currency, issuing
bank acceptance notes to vendors with different interest rates or issuing standby letters of credit. As of September 30, 2016,
our Chinese subsidiary used $7.0 million of its credit facility and issued standby letters of credit as collateral for our Taiwan
branch line of credit with China Construction Bank. As of September 30, 2016, we had no outstanding balance for the U.S. currency
based loan. The outstanding balances of bank acceptance notes issued to vendors were $3.2 million with zero interest rate as of
September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016, there was $4.9
million of restricted cash, investments or security deposit associated mainly with the loan facilities. 

A customary business practice in China is
for customers to exchange accounts receivable with notes receivable issued by their bank. From time to time we accept notes receivable
from certain of our customers in China. These notes receivable are non-interest bearing and are generally due within nine months,
and such notes receivable may be redeemed with the issuing bank prior to maturity at a discount. Historically, we have collected
on the notes receivable in full at the time of maturity. 

Frequently, we also direct our banking partners
to issue bank acceptance notes payable to our suppliers in China in exchange for accounts payable. Our China subsidiary s
banks issue the notes to vendors and issue payment to vendors upon redemption. We owe the payable balance to the issuing bank.
The notes payable are non-interest bearing and are generally due within nine months of issuance. As a condition of the notes payable
lending arrangements, we are required to keep a compensating balance at the issuing banks that is a percentage of the total notes
payable balance until the notes payable are paid by our China subsidiary. These balances are classified as restricted cash on our
consolidated balance sheets. 

Future liquidity needs  

We believe that our existing cash
and cash equivalents, and cash flows from our operating activities and borrowings from our lenders, will be sufficient to
meet our anticipated cash needs for the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including
our growth rate, the timing and extent of spending to support our research and development efforts, the expansion of our
sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products, the expansion of our manufacturing capacity
and the continuing market acceptance of our products. In the event that additional liquidity is required to meet our
long-term investments, we may need to explore additional sources of liquidity by additional bank credit facilities or raising
capital through additional equity or debt financing including our equity financing under our Registration Statement filed
with the SEC in October 2016. The sale of additional equity or debt security could result in additional dilution to our
stockholders, and its terms and prices may not be acceptable to us. If we are unable to raise additional capital when
desired, our business, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments  

The following summarizes our contractual
obligations as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands): 

(1)  
      We have several loan and security agreements in China, Taiwan and the U.S. that provide various credit facilities, including lines of credit, term loans and bank acceptance notes. The amount presented in the table represents the principal portion of the obligations.   
 
      (2)  
      We have entered into various non-cancellable operating lease agreements for our offices in Taiwan.   

Inflation   

We believe that the relatively low rate
of inflation in the U.S. over the past few years has not had a significant impact on our sales or operating results or on the prices
of raw materials. However, an increase in the rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our levels of gross
profit if material prices rise and if sales prices for our products do not proportionately increase. Changes in the proportion
of our operations in China or Taiwan may result in the rate of inflation having a more significant impact on our operating results
in the future. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

For the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, we did not, and we do not currently, have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

In our annual report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015 and in the Notes to the Financial Statements herein, we identify our most critical accounting policies.
In preparing the financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically
evaluate our estimates and judgments that are most critical in nature which are related to revenue recognition under long-term
construction contracts; allowance for doubtful accounts; inventory reserves; impairment of long-lived assets (excluding goodwill
and other indefinite-lived intangible assets); goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets; purchase price allocation
of acquisitions; service and product warranties; and income taxes. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on our
future expectations that we believe are reasonable. The combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results are likely to differ
from our current estimates and those differences may be material. 

JOBS Act  

The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
of 2012, or JOBS Act, contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting requirements for qualifying public
companies. As defined in the JOBS Act, a public company whose initial public offering of common equity securities occurred after
December 8, 2011 and whose annual gross revenues are less than $1.0 billion will, in general, qualify as an  emerging growth
company  until the earliest of: 

the last day of its fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of its initial public offering of common equity securities;    

the last day of its fiscal year in which it has annual gross revenue of $1.0 billion or more;    

the date on which it has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and    

the date on which it is deemed to be a  large accelerated filer,  which will occur at such time as the company (a) has an aggregate worldwide market value of common equity securities held by non-affiliates of $700 million or more as of the last business day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (b) has been required to file annual and quarterly reports under the Exchange Act for a period of at least 12 months and (c) has filed at least one annual report pursuant to the Securities Act of 1934, as amended.    

Under this definition, we are an  emerging
growth company  and could remain one until as late as December 31, 2018. 

As an  emerging growth company 
we have chosen to rely on such exemptions and are therefore not required to, among other things, (i) provide an auditor s
attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
(ii) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank
Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, (iii) comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, or PCAOB, regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional
information about the audit and the financial statements (auditor discussion and analysis) and (iv) disclose certain executive
compensation-related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief
Executive Officer s compensation to median employee compensation. 

Item 3.   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Market Risk  

For quantitative and qualitative disclosures
about market risk affecting the Company, see Item 7A   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. We do not believe the Company s exposure to market
risk has changed materially since December 31, 2015. 

Item 4.   Controls and Procedures  

The term  disclosure controls and
procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a
company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules
and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance
of achieving their control objectives. 

Our management, with the participation of
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2016. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as
of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There were no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting during the three month period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which were identified in
connection with management s evaluation required by the Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act that occurred
during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

Part II. Other Information  

Item 1.   Legal Proceedings  

As of September 30, 2016, we were not involved
in any material pending legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Investing in our common stock
involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained
in  our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the
following risks actually occur, we may be unable to conduct our business as currently planned and our financial condition and
results of operations could be seriously harmed. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the
occurrence of any of these risks and you may lose all or part of your investment.  

Risks Inherent in Our Business  

We are dependent on our key customers for a significant
portion of our revenue and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, any of our key customers would adversely impact
our revenue and results of operations.   

We generate much of our revenue from a limited
number of customers. In 2015, 2014 and 2013 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our top ten customers represented
88.7%, 87.2%, 76.9%, 95.5% and 95.2% of our revenue, respectively. In 2015, Amazon represented 52.5% of our revenue, Microsoft
represented 11.6% of our revenue, and Cisco represented 10.4% of our revenue. As a result, the loss of, or a significant reduction
in orders from any of our key customers would materially and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. We typically
do not have long-term contracts with our customers and instead rely on recurring purchase orders. If our key customers do not continue
to purchase our existing products or fail to purchase additional products from us, our revenue would decline and our results of
operations would be adversely affected. 

Adverse events affecting our
key customers could also negatively affect our ability to retain their business and obtain new purchase orders, which
could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. For example, in recent years, there has been consolidation
among various network equipment manufacturers and this trend is expected to continue. For example, in January 2016, Arris
Group Inc. ( Arris ) completed its purchase of Pace Plc ( Pace ). Pace and Arris have historically
been our customers, and if we fail to achieve historical levels of sales of our products to the new entity, the loss or
reduction in sales could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
We are unable to predict the impact that industry consolidation would have on our existing or potential customers. We may not
be able to offset any potential decline in revenue arising from the consolidation of our existing customers with revenue from
new customers or additional revenue from the merged company. 

Customer demand is difficult to forecast accurately and,
as a result, we may be unable to match production with customer demand.   

We make planning and spending decisions,
including determining the levels of business that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments,
personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of product demand and customer requirements. Our products
are typically purchased pursuant to individual purchase orders. While our customers may provide us with their demand forecasts,
they are typically not contractually committed to buy any quantity of products beyond firm purchase orders. Furthermore, many of
our customers may increase, decrease, cancel or delay purchase orders already in place without significant penalty. The short-term
nature of commitments by our customers and the possibility of unexpected changes in demand for their products reduce our ability
to accurately estimate future customer requirements. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which can
strain our resources, cause our manufacturing to be negatively impacted by materials shortages, necessitate more onerous procurement
commitments and reduce our gross margin. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet the volume demands of our
customers, or one or more of our suppliers may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our volume demands. If any
of our major customers decrease, stop or delay purchasing our products for any reason, we will likely have excess manufacturing
capacity or inventory and our business and results of operations would be harmed. 

If our customers do not qualify our products for use on
a timely basis, our results of operations may suffer.   

Prior to the sale of new products, our customers
typically require us to  qualify  our products for use in their applications. At the successful completion of this
qualification process, we refer to the resulting sales opportunity as a  design win.  Additionally, new customers often
audit our manufacturing facilities and perform other evaluations during this qualification process. The qualification process involves
product sampling and reliability testing and collaboration with our product management and engineering teams in the design and
manufacturing stages. If we are unable to accurately predict the amount of time required to qualify our products with customers,
or are unable to qualify our products with certain customers at all, then our ability to generate revenue could be delayed or our
revenue would be lower than expected and we may not be able to recover the costs associated with the qualification process or with
our product development efforts, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 

In addition, due to rapid technological
changes in our markets, a customer may cancel or modify a design project before we have qualified our product or begun volume manufacturing
of a qualified product. It is unlikely that we would be able to recover the expenses for cancelled or unutilized custom design
projects. Some of these unrecoverable expenses for cancelled or unutilized custom design projects may be significant. It is difficult
to predict with any certainty whether our customers will delay or terminate product qualification or the frequency with which customers
will cancel or modify their projects, but any such delay, cancellation or modification would have a negative effect on our results
of operations. 

Our ability to successfully qualify and
scale capacity for new technologies and products is important to our ability to grow our business and market presence, and we may
invest a significant amount to scale our capacity to meet potential demand from customers for our new technologies and products.
If we are unable to qualify and sell any of our new products in volume, on time, or at all, our results of operations may be adversely
affected. 

We face intense competition which could negatively impact
our results of operations and market share.   

The markets into which we sell our products
are highly competitive. Our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of products to smaller
companies specializing in niche markets. Current and potential competitors may have substantially greater name recognition, financial,
marketing, research and manufacturing resources than we do, and there can be no assurance that our current and future competitors
will not be more successful than us in specific product lines or markets. Some of our competitors may also have better-established
relationships with our current or potential customers. Some of our competitors have more resources to develop or acquire new products
and technologies and create market awareness for their products and technologies. In addition, some of our competitors have the
financial resources to offer competitive products at below-market pricing levels that could prevent us from competing effectively
and result in a loss of sales or market share or cause us to lower prices for our products. In recent years, there has been consolidation
in our industry and we expect such consolidation to continue. Consolidation involving our competitors could result in even more
intense competition. Network equipment manufacturers, who are our customers, and network service providers may decide to manufacture
the optical subsystems incorporated into their network systems in-house instead of outsourcing such products to companies such
as us. We also encounter potential customers that, because of existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to the
products offered by our competitors. 

We must continually develop successful new products and
enhance existing products, and if we fail to do so or if our release of new or enhanced products is delayed, our business may be
harmed.   

The markets for our products are characterized
by frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards, all with an underlying
pressure to reduce cost and meet stringent reliability and qualification requirements. Our future performance will depend on our
successful development, introduction and market acceptance of new and enhanced products that address these challenges. If we are
unable to make our new or enhanced products commercially available on a timely basis, we may lose existing and potential customers
and our financial results would suffer. 

In addition, due to the costs and length
of research, development and manufacturing process cycles, we may not recognize revenue from new products until long after such
expenditures, if at all, and our margins may decrease if our costs are higher than expected, adversely affecting our financial
condition and results of operation. 

Although the length of our product development
cycle varies widely by product and customer, it may take 18 months or longer before we receive our first order. As a result,
we may incur significant expenses long before customers accept and purchase our products. 

Product development delays may result from
numerous factors, including: 

modification of product specifications and customer requirements;   

unanticipated engineering complexities;   

difficulties in reallocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations; and   

rapidly changing technology or competitive product requirements.   

The introduction of new products by us or
our competitors could result in a slowdown in demand for our existing products and could result in a write-down in the value of
our inventory. We have in the past experienced a slowdown in demand for existing products and delays in new product development,
and such delays will likely occur in the future. To the extent we experience product development delays for any reason or we fail
to qualify our products and obtain their approval for use, which we refer to as a design win, our competitive position would be
adversely affected and our ability to grow our revenue would be impaired. 

Furthermore, our ability to enter a market
with new products in a timely manner can be critical to our success because it is difficult to displace an existing supplier for
a particular type of product once a customer has chosen a supplier, even if a later-to-market product provides better performance
or cost efficiency. 

The development of new, technologically
advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring frequent innovation, highly-skilled engineering and development
personnel and significant capital, as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to identify, develop, manufacture, market or support new or enhanced products successfully or on a timely
basis. Further, we cannot assure you that our new products will gain market acceptance or that we will be able to respond effectively
to product introductions by competitors, technological changes or emerging industry standards. We also may not be able to develop
the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and enhancements, license these technologies from third parties,
or remain competitive in our markets. 

We are subject to the cyclical nature of the markets in
which we compete and any future downturn will likely reduce demand for our products and revenue.   

In each of our target markets, including
the CATV market, our sales depend on the aggregate capital expenditures of service providers as they build out and upgrade their
network infrastructure. These markets are highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion,
evolving standards and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand. In the past, these markets have experienced significant
downturns, often connected with, or in anticipation of, the maturation of product cycles. These downturns have been characterized
by diminished product demand, production overcapacity, high inventory levels and accelerated erosion of average selling prices.
Our historical results of operations have been subject to these cyclical fluctuations, and we may experience substantial period-to-period
fluctuations in our future results of operations. Any future downturn in any of the markets in which we compete could significantly
reduce the demand for our products and therefore may result in a significant reduction in our revenue. Our revenue and results
of operations may be materially and adversely affected in the future due to changes in demand from individual customers or cyclical
changes in any of the markets utilizing our products. We may not be able to accurately predict these cyclical fluctuations and
the impact of these fluctuations may have on our revenue and operating results. 

If the CATV market does not continue to develop as we
expect, or if there is any downturn in this market, our business would be adversely affected.   

Historically, we have generated much
of our revenue from the CATV market. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, the CATV market represented 28.3%, 36.3% and 60.4% of our
revenue, respectively. In the CATV market, we are relying on expected increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive services and
applications such as on-demand television programs, high-definition television channels, or HDTV, social media, peer-to-peer
file sharing and online video creation and viewing from network service providers. Without network and bandwidth growth, the
need for our products will not increase and may decline, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of
operations. Although demand for broadband access is increasing, network and bandwidth growth may be limited by several
factors, including an uncertain regulatory environment, high infrastructure costs to purchase and install equipment and
uncertainty as to which competing content delivery solution, such as telecommunications, wireless or satellite, will gain the
most widespread acceptance. If the trend of outsourcing for the design and manufacture of CATV equipment does not continue,
or continues at a slower pace than currently expected, our customers  demand for our design and manufacturing services
may not grow as quickly as expected. If expectations for the growth of the CATV market are not realized, our financial
condition or results of operations will be adversely affected. In addition, if the CATV market is adversely impacted, whether
due to competitive pressure from telecommunication service providers, regulatory changes, or otherwise, our business would be
adversely affected. We may not be able to offset any potential decline in revenue from the CATV market with revenue from new
customers in other markets. 

Increasing costs and shifts in product mix may adversely
impact our gross margins.   

Our gross margins on individual products
and among products fluctuate over each product s life cycle. Our overall gross margins have fluctuated from period to period
as a result of shifts in product mix, the introduction of new products, decreases in average selling prices and our ability to
reduce product costs, and these fluctuations are expected to continue in the future. We may not be able to accurately predict our
product mix from period to period, and as a result we may not be able to forecast accurately our overall gross margins. The rate
of increase in our costs and expenses may exceed the rate of increase in our revenue, either of which would materially and adversely
affect our business, our results of operations and our financial condition. 

We expanded to new facilities in our Sugar Land, TX location.
These facilities will add significant additional costs and if we fail to adequately utilize the additional production capacity,
our results of operations will suffer.   

In 2015, we began construction of two new
buildings located immediately adjacent to our existing headquarters building in Sugar Land, TX. The construction of these two new
buildings was completed in May, 2016. The estimated cost of construction for these new facilities is approximately $33 million,
and we expect to invest significant additional resources to add production equipment to the new facilities. Much of this equipment
must be ordered far in advance of its delivery date, and accordingly we must make the decision to purchase equipment long before
we see additional orders for our products. While we endeavor to order equipment that is flexible in utilization, if we over-estimate
aggregate demand for our products, or if we fail to accurately predict the types of products that customers will demand in the
future, we may be forced to under-utilize this equipment, which could result in asset impairment charges, additional costs to reconfigure
equipment to be used in other production, or other charges that would negatively affect our results of operations. Any delay to
our start-up schedule for this new equipment could cause us to have insufficient production capacity to meet customer orders. 

We have limited operating history in the FTTH market,
and our business could be harmed if this market does not develop as we expect.   

For 2015 and 2014, respectively, we generated
1.3%, and 10.4% of our revenue from the FTTH market. We have only recently begun offering products to the FTTH market, and our
WDM-PON products designed for this market have not yet, and may never, gain widespread acceptance by large internet service providers.
Our business in this market is dependent on the deployment of our optical components, modules and subassemblies. We are relying
on increasing demand for bandwidth-intensive services and telecommunications service providers  acceptance and deployment
of WDM-PON as a technology supporting 1 gigabit per second service to the home. Without network and bandwidth growth and adoption
of our solutions by operators in these markets, we will not be able to sell our products in these markets in high volume or at
our targeted margins, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. For example, WDM-PON technology
may not be adopted by equipment and service providers in the FTTH market as rapidly as we expect or in the volumes we need to achieve
acceptable margins. Network and bandwidth growth may be limited by several factors, including an uncertain regulatory environment,
high infrastructure costs to purchase and install equipment and uncertainty as to which competing content delivery solution, such
as CATV, will gain the most widespread acceptance. In addition, as we enter new markets or expand our product offerings in existing
markets, our margins may be adversely affected due to competition in those markets and commoditization of competing products. If
our expectations for the growth of these markets are not realized, our financial condition or results of operations will be adversely
affected. 

If we encounter manufacturing problems, we may lose sales
and damage our customer relationships.   

We may experience delays, disruptions or
quality control problems in our manufacturing operations. These and other factors may cause less than acceptable yields at our
wafer fabrication facility. Manufacturing yields depend on a number of factors, including the quality of available raw materials,
the degradation or change in equipment calibration and the rate and timing of the introduction of new products. Changes in manufacturing
processes required as a result of changes in product specifications, changing customer needs and the introduction of new product
lines may significantly reduce our manufacturing yields, resulting in low or negative margins on those products. In addition, we
use our Molecular Beam Epitaxy, or MBE, fabrication process to make our lasers, in addition to Metal Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition,
or MOCVD, the technique most commonly used in optical manufacturing by communications optics vendors, and our MBE fabrication process
relies on custom-manufactured equipment. If our MBE or MOCVD fabrication facility in Sugar Land, Texas were to be damaged or destroyed
for any reason, our manufacturing process would be severely disrupted. Any such manufacturing problems would likely delay product
shipments to our customers, which would negatively affect our sales, competitive position and reputation. We may also experience
delays in production, typically in February, during the Chinese New Year holiday when our facilities in China and Taiwan are closed. 

Given the high fixed costs associated with our vertically
integrated business, a reduction in demand for our products will likely adversely impact our gross profits and our results of operations.   

We have a high fixed cost base due to our
vertically integrated business model, including the fact that 1,960 of our employees as of December 31, 2015 were employed in manufacturing
and research and development operations. We may not be able to adjust these fixed costs quickly to adapt to rapidly changing market
conditions. Our gross profit and gross margin are greatly affected by our sales volume and volatility on a quarterly basis and
the corresponding absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses. In addition, because we are a vertically integrated manufacturer,
insufficient demand for our products may subject us to the risk of high inventory carrying costs and increased inventory obsolescence.
Given our vertical integration, the rate at which we turn inventory has historically been low when compared to our cost of sales.
We do not expect this to change significantly in the future and believe that we will have to maintain a relatively high level of
inventory compared to our cost of sales. As a result, we continue to expect to have a significant amount of working capital invested
in inventory. We may be required to write down inventory costs in the future and our high inventory costs may have an adverse effect
on our gross profits and our results of operations. 

We have a history of losses and have a substantial accumulated
deficit.   

We have a history of losses and have a substantial
accumulated deficit. In the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we experienced net losses of $1.4 million and $0.9 million,
respectively. In 2014 and 2015, we experienced profit of $4.3 million and $10.8 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015
and 2014, our accumulated deficit was $68.2 million and $79.0 million, respectively. Our losses in past years were due to expenditures
made to expand our business, including expenditures for hiring additional research and development, and sales and marketing personnel,
and expenditures to expand and maintain our manufacturing facilities and research and development operations. We expect to continue
to make significant expenditures related to our business, including expenditures for hiring additional research and development,
and sales and marketing personnel, and expenditures to maintain and expand our manufacturing facilities and research and development
operations. In addition, we have incurred significant additional time demands and legal, accounting and other expenses since we
became a public company in September 2013. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to complying
with the applicable rules and requirements of being a public company. 

Our financial results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter
due to a number of factors, which may lead to volatility in our stock price.   

Our quarterly revenue and operating results
have varied in the past and will likely continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. This variability may lead to volatility
in our stock price as research analysts and investors respond to these quarterly fluctuations. These fluctuations are due to numerous
factors, including: 

the timing, size and mix of sales of our products;   

fluctuations in demand for our products, including the increase, decrease, rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders;   

our ability to design, manufacture and deliver products which meet customer requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner;   

new product introductions and enhancements by us or our competitors;   

the gain or loss of key customers;   

the rate at which our present and potential customers and end users adopt our technologies;   

changes in our pricing and sales policies or the pricing and sales policies of our competitors;   

quality control or yield problems in our manufacturing operations;   

supply disruption for certain raw materials and components used in our products;   

capacity constraints of our outside contract manufacturers for a portion of the manufacturing process for some of our products;   

length and variability of the sales cycles of our products;   

unanticipated increases in costs or expenses;   

the loss of key employees;   

different capital expenditure and budget cycles for our customers, affecting the timing of their spending for our products;   

political stability in the areas of the world in which we operate;   

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;   

changes in accounting rules;   

the evolving and unpredictable nature of the markets for products incorporating our solutions; and   

general economic conditions and changes in such conditions specific to our target markets.   

The foregoing factors are difficult to forecast,
and these, as well as other factors, could materially adversely affect our quarterly and annual operating results. In addition,
a significant amount of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our internal manufacturing, research and development,
sales and general administrative efforts. Any failure to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for a revenue shortfall could
magnify the adverse impact of such revenue shortfall on our results of operations. For these reasons, you should not rely on quarter-to-quarter
comparisons of our results of operations as an indicator of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet our
announced guidance or the expectations of research analysts or investors, in which case the price of our common stock could decrease
significantly. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully address these risks. 

We depend on key personnel to develop and maintain our
technology and manage our business in a rapidly changing market.   

The continued services of our executive
officers and other key engineering, sales, marketing, manufacturing and support personnel is essential to our success. For example,
our ability to achieve new design wins depends upon the experience and expertise of our engineers. Any of our key employees, including
our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Senior Vice President of Network Equipment Module Business Unit, Senior Vice
President of Optical Module Division and Asia General Manager, may resign at any time. We do not have key person life insurance
policies covering any of our employees. To implement our business plan, we also intend to hire additional employees, particularly
in the areas of engineering, manufacturing and sales. Our ability to continue to attract and retain highly skilled employees is
a critical factor in our success. Competition for highly skilled personnel is intense. We may not be successful in attracting,
assimilating or retaining qualified personnel to satisfy our current or future needs. Our ability to develop, manufacture and sell
our products, and thus our financial condition and results of operations, would be adversely affected if we are unable to retain
existing personnel or hire additional qualified personnel. 

We depend on a limited number of suppliers and any supply
interruption could have an adverse effect on our business.   

We depend on a limited number of suppliers
for certain raw materials and components used in our products. Some of these suppliers could disrupt our business if they stop,
decrease or delay shipments or if the materials or components they ship have quality or reliability issues. Some of the raw materials
and components we use in our products are available only from a sole source or have been qualified only from a single supplier.
Furthermore, other than our current suppliers, there are a limited number of entities from whom we could obtain certain materials
and components. We may also face shortages if we experience increased demand for materials or components beyond what our qualified
suppliers can deliver. Our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of critical materials or components could adversely affect
our ability to meet demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operation. 

We typically have not entered into long-term
agreements with our suppliers and, therefore, our suppliers could stop supplying materials and components to us at any time or
fail to supply adequate quantities of materials or components to us on a timely basis. It is difficult, costly, time consuming
and, on short notice, sometimes impossible for us to identify and qualify new suppliers. Our customers generally restrict our ability
to change the components in our products. For more critical components, any changes may require repeating the entire qualification
process. Our reliance on a limited number of suppliers or a single qualified vendor may result in delivery and quality problems,
and reduced control over product pricing, reliability and performance. 

We depend upon outside contract manufacturers for a portion
of the manufacturing process for some of our products.   

Almost all of our products are manufactured
internally. However we also rely upon manufacturers in China, Taiwan and other Asia locations to provide back-end manufacturing
and produce the finished portion of a few of our products. Our reliance on a contract manufacturer for these products makes us
vulnerable to possible capacity constraints and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, manufacturing quality/controls
and costs. If one of our contract manufacturers is unable to meet all of our customer demand in a timely fashion, this could have
a material adverse effect on the revenue from our products. If the contract manufacturer for one of our products was unable or
unwilling to manufacture such product in required volumes and at high quality levels or to continue our existing supply arrangement,
we would have to identify, qualify and select an acceptable alternative contract manufacturer or move these manufacturing operations
to our internal manufacturing facilities. An alternative contract manufacturer may not be available to us when needed or may not
be in a position to satisfy our quality or production requirements on commercially reasonable terms, including price. Any significant
interruption in manufacturing our products would require us to reduce our supply of products to our customers, which in turn, would
reduce our revenue, harm our relationships with the customer of these products and cause us to forego potential revenue opportunities. 

Our products could contain defects that may cause us to
incur significant costs or result in a loss of customers.   

Our products are complex and undergo quality
testing as well as formal qualification by our customers. Our customers  testing procedures are limited to evaluating our
products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios and over varying amounts of time. For various reasons, such as the occurrence
of performance problems that are unforeseeable in testing or that are detected only when products age or are operated under peak
stress conditions, our products may fail to perform as expected long after customer acceptance. Failures could result from faulty
components or design, problems in manufacturing or other unforeseen reasons. As a result, we could incur significant costs to repair
or replace defective products under warranty, particularly when such failures occur in installed systems. Our products are typically
embedded in, or deployed in conjunction with, our customers  products, which incorporate a variety of components, modules
and subsystems and may be expected to interoperate with modules produced by third parties. As a result, not all defects are immediately
detectable and when problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. While we have not experienced material
failures in the past, we will continue to face this risk going forward because our products are widely deployed in many demanding
environments and applications worldwide. In addition, we may in certain circumstances honor warranty claims after the warranty
has expired or for problems not covered by warranty to maintain customer relationships. Any significant product failure could result
in litigation, damages, repair costs and lost future sales of the affected product and other products, divert the attention of
our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems, all of which
would harm our business. Although we carry product liability insurance, this insurance may not adequately cover our costs arising
from defects in our products or otherwise. 

We face a variety of risks associated with our international
sales and operations.   

We currently derive, and expect to continue
to derive, a significant portion of our revenue from sales to international customers. In 2015, 2014 and 2013, 19.0%, 29.5% and
41.0% of our revenue was derived from sales that occurred outside of North America, respectively. In addition, a significant portion
of our manufacturing operations is based in Ningbo, China and Taipei, Taiwan. Our international revenue and operations are subject
to a number of material risks, including: 

difficulties in staffing, managing and supporting operations in more than one country;   

difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;   

fewer legal protections for intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions;   

foreign and U.S. taxation issues and international trade barriers;   

difficulties in obtaining any necessary governmental authorizations for the export of our products to certain foreign jurisdictions;   

fluctuations in foreign economies;   

fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies and interest rates;   

trade and travel restrictions;   

domestic and international economic or political changes, hostilities and other disruptions in regions where we currently operate or may operate in the future;   

difficulties and increased expenses in complying with a variety of U.S. and foreign laws, regulations and trade standards, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and   

different and changing legal and regulatory requirements in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or may operate in the future.    

Negative developments in any of these factors
in China or Taiwan or other countries could result in a reduction in demand for our products, the cancellation or delay of orders
already placed, difficulties in producing and delivering our products, threats to our intellectual property, difficulty in collecting
receivables, and a higher cost of doing business. Although we maintain certain compliance programs throughout the company, violations
of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations may result in criminal or civil sanctions, including material monetary fines, penalties
and other costs against us or our employees, and may have a material adverse effect on our business. 

Our business operations conducted in China
and Taiwan are important to our success. A substantial portion of our property, plant and equipment is located in China and Taiwan.
We expect to make further investments in China and Taiwan in the future. Therefore, our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects are subject to economic, political, legal, and social events and developments in China and Taiwan.
Factors affecting military, political or economic conditions in China and Taiwan could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition and results of operations, as well as the market price and the liquidity of our common shares. 

In some instances, we rely on third parties to assist
in selling our products, and the failure of those parties to perform as expected could reduce our future revenue.   

Although we primarily sell our products
through direct sales, we also sell our products to some of our customers through third party sales representatives and distributors.
Many of such third parties also market and sell products from our competitors. Our third party sales representatives and distributors
may terminate their relationships with us at any time, or with short notice. Our future performance will also depend, in part,
on our ability to attract additional third party sales representatives and distributors that will be able to market and support
our products effectively, especially in markets in which we have not previously distributed our products. If our current third
party sales representatives and distributors fail to perform as expected, our revenue and results of operations could be harmed. 

Failure to manage our growth effectively may adversely
affect our financial condition and results of operations.   

Successful implementation of our business
plan in our target markets requires effective planning and management. Our production volumes are increasing significantly and
we have announced plans to increase our production capacity in response to demand for our products, adding both personnel as well
as expanding our physical manufacturing facilities. We currently operate facilities in Sugar Land, Texas, Ningbo, China, Taipei,
Taiwan, and Duluth, Georgia. We currently manufacture our lasers using a proprietary process and customized equipment located only
in our Sugar Land, Texas facility, and it will be costly to duplicate that facility, to scale our laser manufacturing capacity
or to mitigate the risks associated with operating a single facility. The challenges of managing our geographically dispersed operations
have increased and will continue to increase the demand on our management systems and resources. Moreover, we are continuing to
improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. Any failure to manage our expansion and the resulting
demands on our management systems and resources effectively may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

Our loan agreements contain restrictive covenants that
may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.   

We have lending arrangements with several
financial institutions, including loan agreements with East West Bank and Comerica Bank in the U.S., and our Taiwan location and
China subsidiary have several lines of credit arrangements. Our loan agreements governing our long-term debt obligations in the
U.S. contain certain financial and operating covenants that limit our management s discretion with respect to certain business
matters. Among other things, these covenants require us to maintain certain financial ratios and restrict our ability to incur
additional debt, create liens or other encumbrances, change the nature of our business, pay dividends, sell or otherwise dispose
of assets and merge or consolidate with other entities. These restrictions may limit our flexibility in responding to business
opportunities, competitive developments and adverse economic or industry conditions. Any failure by us or our subsidiaries to comply
with these agreements could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our obligations under our
loan agreements with East West Bank and Comerica Bank are secured by substantially all of our U.S. assets. A breach of any of covenants
under our loan agreements, or a failure to pay interest or indebtedness when due under any of our credit facilities, could result
in a variety of adverse consequences, including the acceleration of our indebtedness. 

We may not be able to obtain additional capital when desired,
on favorable terms or at all.   

We operate in a market that makes our prospects
difficult to evaluate and, to remain competitive, we will be required to make continued investments in capital equipment, facilities
and technological improvements. We expect that substantial capital will be required to expand our manufacturing capacity and fund
working capital for anticipated growth. If we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations or otherwise have the capital
resources to meet our future capital needs, we may need additional financing to implement our business strategy, which includes: 

expansion of research and development;   

expansion of manufacturing capabilities;   

hiring of additional technical, sales and other personnel; and   

acquisitions of complementary businesses.   

If we raise additional funds
through the issuance of our common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interests of our stockholders could
be significantly diluted. These newly issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of
existing stockholders. Additional financing may not, however, be available on terms favorable to us, or at all, if and when
needed, and our ability to fund our operations, take advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our
infrastructure or respond to competitive pressures could be significantly limited. If we cannot raise required capital when
needed, including under our Registration Statement filed with the SEC in October 2016, we may be unable to meet the demands
of existing and prospective customers, adversely affecting our sales and market opportunities and consequently our
business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Future acquisitions may adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.   

As part of our business strategy, we may
pursue acquisitions of companies that we believe could enhance or complement our current product portfolio, augment our technology
roadmap or diversify our revenue base. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including: 

difficulties integrating the acquired business;   

unanticipated costs, capital expenditures or liabilities or changes related to research in progress and product development;   

diversion of financial and management resources from our existing business;   

difficulties integrating the business relationships with suppliers and customers of the acquired business with our existing business relationships;   

risks associated with entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience; and   

potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired organizations.   

Acquisitions may also result in the recording
of goodwill and other intangible assets subject to potential impairment in the future, adversely affecting our operating results.
We may not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition if we fail to evaluate it properly, and we may incur costs in excess
of what we anticipate. A failure to evaluate and execute an acquisition appropriately or otherwise adequately address these risks
may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 

We may be subject to disruptions or failures in information
technology systems and network infrastructures that could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.   

We rely on the efficient and uninterrupted
operation of complex information technology systems and network infrastructures to operate our business. A disruption, infiltration
or failure of our information technology systems as a result of software or hardware malfunctions, system implementations or upgrades,
computer viruses, third-party security breaches, employee error, theft or misuse, malfeasance, power disruptions, natural disasters
or accidents could cause a breach of data security, loss of intellectual property and critical data and the release and misappropriation
of sensitive competitive information and partner, customer, and employee personal data. Any of these events could harm our competitive
position, result in a loss of customer confidence, cause us to incur significant costs to remedy any damages and ultimately materially
adversely affect our business and financial condition. 

Our future results of operations may be subject to volatility
as a result of exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.   

We have significant foreign currency exposure,
and are affected by fluctuations among the U.S. dollar, the Chinese renminbi, or RMB, and the New Taiwan dollar, or NT dollar,
because a substantial portion of our business is conducted in China and Taiwan. Our sales, raw materials, components and capital
expenditures are denominated in U.S. dollars, RMB and NT dollars in varying amounts. 

Foreign currency fluctuations may adversely
affect our revenue and our costs and expenses, and hence our results of operations. The value of the NT dollar or the RMB against
the U.S. dollar and other currencies may fluctuate and be affected by, among other things, changes in political and economic conditions.
The RMB currency is no longer being pegged solely to the value of the U.S. dollar. In the long term, the RMB may appreciate or
depreciate significantly in value against the U.S. dollar, depending upon the fluctuation of the basket of currencies against which
it is currently valued, or it may be permitted to enter into a full float, which may also result in a significant appreciation
or depreciation of the RMB against the U.S. dollar. In addition, our currency exchange variations may be magnified by Chinese exchange
control regulations that restrict our ability to convert RMB into foreign currency. 

Our sales in Europe are denominated in U.S.
dollars and fluctuations in the Euro or our customers  other local currencies relative to the U.S. dollar may impact our
customers and affect our financial performance. If our customers  local currencies weaken against the U.S. dollar, we may
need to lower our prices to remain competitive in our international markets which could have a material adverse effect on our margins.
If our customers  local currencies strengthen against the U.S. dollar and if the local sales prices cannot be raised due
to competitive pressures, we will experience a deterioration of our margins. 

To date, we have not entered into any hedging
transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk. While we may decide to enter into hedging transactions
in the future, the availability and effectiveness of these hedging transactions may be limited and we may not be able to successfully
hedge our exposure. 

Natural disasters or other catastrophic events could harm
our operations.   

Our operations in the U.S., China and Taiwan
could be subject to significant risk of natural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding and tornadoes,
as well as other catastrophic events, such as epidemics, terrorist attacks or wars. For example, our corporate headquarters and
wafer fabrication facility in Sugar Land, Texas, is located near the Gulf of Mexico, an area that is susceptible to hurricanes.
We use a proprietary MBE laser manufacturing process that requires customized equipment, and this process is currently conducted
and located solely at our wafer fabrication facility in Sugar Land, Texas, such that a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other
catastrophic event that affects that facility would materially harm our operations. In addition, our manufacturing facility in
Taipei, Taiwan, is susceptible to typhoons and earthquakes, and our manufacturing facility in Ningbo, China, has from time to time,
suffered electrical outages. Any disruption in our manufacturing facilities arising from these and other natural disasters or other
catastrophic events could cause significant delays in the production or shipment of our products until we are able to shift production
to different facilities or arrange for third parties to manufacture our products. We may not be able to obtain alternate capacity
on favorable terms or at all. Our property insurance coverage with respect to natural disaster is limited and is subject to deductible
and coverage limits. Such coverage may not be adequate or continue to be available at commercially reasonable rates and terms.
The occurrence of any of these circumstances may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation. 

If we fail to protect, or incur significant costs in defending,
our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, our business and results of operations could be materially harmed.   

Our success depends on our ability to protect
our intellectual property and other proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, trade secret
and unfair competition laws, as well as license agreements and other contractual provisions, to establish and protect our intellectual
property and other proprietary rights. We have applied for patent registrations in the U.S. and in other foreign countries, some
of which have been issued. In addition, we have registered certain trademarks in the U.S. We cannot guarantee that our pending
applications will be approved by the applicable governmental authorities. Moreover, our existing and future patents and trademarks
may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary rights or may be held invalid or unenforceable in court. A failure to
obtain patents or trademark registrations or a successful challenge to our registrations in the U.S. or other foreign countries
may limit our ability to protect the intellectual property rights that these applications and registrations intended to cover. 

Policing unauthorized use of our technology
is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent the misappropriation, unauthorized use or other
infringement of our intellectual property rights. Further, we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property
rights from misappropriation or other infringement in foreign countries where we have not applied for patent protections, and where
effective patent, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws may be unavailable, or may not protect our proprietary
rights as fully as U.S. law. We may seek to secure comparable intellectual property protections in other countries. However, the
level of protection afforded by patent and other laws in other countries may not be comparable to that afforded in the U.S. 

We also attempt to protect our intellectual
property, including our trade secrets and know-how, through the use of trade secret and other intellectual property laws, and contractual
provisions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and independent consultants. We
also use non-disclosure agreements with other third parties who may have access to our proprietary technologies and information.
Such measures, however, provide only limited protection, and there can be no assurance that our confidentiality and non-disclosure
agreements will not be breached, especially after our employees end their employment, and that our trade secrets will not otherwise
become known by competitors or that we will have adequate remedies in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of proprietary
information. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer our products or portions of our products, otherwise
obtain and use our intellectual property, or may independently develop similar or equivalent trade secrets or know-how. If we fail
to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, or if such intellectual property and proprietary rights are
infringed or misappropriated, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially harmed. 

In the future, we may need to take legal
actions to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property or from otherwise gaining access
to our technology. Protecting and enforcing our intellectual property rights and determining their validity and scope could result
in significant litigation costs and require significant time and attention from our technical and management personnel, which could
significantly harm our business. We may not prevail in such proceedings, and an adverse outcome may adversely impact our competitive
advantage or otherwise harm our financial condition and our business. 

We may be involved in intellectual property disputes in
the future, which could divert management s attention, cause us to incur significant costs and prevent us from selling or
using the challenged technology.   

Participants in the markets in which we
sell our products have experienced frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we have a
policy in place that is designed to reduce the risk of infringement of intellectual property rights of others and we have conducted
a limited review of other companies  relevant patents, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement
claims against us. We cannot be certain that our products would not be found infringing on the intellectual property rights of
others. Regardless of their merit, responding to such claims can be time consuming, divert management s attention and resources
and may cause us to incur significant expenses. Intellectual property claims against us could force us to do one or more of the
following: 

obtain from a third party claiming infringement a license to the relevant technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all;   

stop manufacturing, selling, incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property;   

pay substantial monetary damages; or   

expend significant resources to redesign the products that use the technology and to develop non-infringing technology.   

Any of these actions could result in a substantial
reduction in our revenue and could result in losses over an extended period of time. 

In any potential intellectual property dispute,
our customers could also become the target of litigation. Because we often indemnify our customers for intellectual property claims
made against them with respect to our products, any claims against our customers could trigger indemnification claims against us.
These obligations could result in substantial expenses such as legal expenses, damages for past infringement or royalties for future
use. Any indemnity claim could also adversely affect our relationships with our customers and result in substantial costs to us. 

If we fail to obtain the right to use the intellectual
property rights of others that are necessary to operate our business, and to protect their intellectual property, our business
and results of operations will be adversely affected.   

From time to time we may choose to or be
required to license technology or intellectual property from third parties in connection with the development of our products.
We cannot assure you that third party licenses will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Generally,
a license, if granted, would include payments of up-front fees, ongoing royalties or both. These payments or other terms could
have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations. Our inability to obtain a necessary third party license required
for our product offerings or to develop new products and product enhancements could require us to substitute technology of lower
quality or performance standards, or of greater cost, either of which could adversely affect our business. If we are not able to
obtain licenses from third parties, if necessary, then we may also be subject to litigation to defend against infringement claims
from these third parties. Our competitors may be able to obtain licenses or cross-license their technology on better terms than
we can, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. 

If we fail to maintain effective internal control over
financial reporting in the future, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected.   

Preparing our consolidated financial statements
involves a number of complex manual and automated processes, which are dependent upon individual data input or review and require
significant management judgment. One or more of these elements may result in errors that may not be detected and could result in
a material misstatement of our consolidated financial statements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that as
a publicly-traded company we disclose whether our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures
are effective. In addition, for so long as we qualify as an  emerging growth company  under the JOBS Act, which may
be up to five years following our initial public offering in September 2013, we will not have to provide an auditor s attestation
report on our internal controls in future annual reports on Form 10-K as otherwise required by Section 404(b) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. During the course of any evaluation, documentation or attestation, we or our independent registered public
accounting firm may identify weaknesses and deficiencies that we may not otherwise identify in a timely manner or at all as a result
of the deferred implementation of this additional level of review. 

We have implemented internal controls that
we believe provide reasonable assurance that we will be able to avoid accounting errors or material weaknesses in future periods.
However, our internal controls cannot guarantee that no accounting errors exist or that all accounting errors, no matter how immaterial,
will be detected because a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, but not absolute
assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. If we are unable to implement and maintain effective internal
control over financial reporting, our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results could be adversely impacted.
This could result in late filings of our annual and quarterly reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange
Act, restatements of our consolidated financial statements, a decline in our stock price, suspension or delisting of our common
stock by NASDAQ, or other material adverse effects on our business, reputation, results of operations or financial condition. 

Our ability to use our net operating losses and certain
other tax attributes may be limited.   

As of December 31, 2015, we had U.S. accumulated
net operating losses, or NOLs, of approximately $50.3 million for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Under Section 382 of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an  ownership change,  the corporation s ability
to use its pre-change NOLs, R D credits and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited.
An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50% change in equity ownership by value over a 3-year period. Based
upon an analysis of our equity ownership, we believe that we have experienced ownership changes and therefore our annual utilization
of our NOLs is limited. In addition, should we experience additional ownership changes, our NOL carry forwards may be further
limited. 

Changes in our effective tax rate may adversely affect
our results of operation and our business.   

We are subject to income taxes in the U.S.
and other foreign jurisdictions, including China and Taiwan. In addition, we are subject to various state taxes in states where
we have nexus. We base our tax position on the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and our understanding of the tax
laws of the countries and states in which we have assets or conduct activities. Our tax position may be reviewed or challenged
by tax authorities. Moreover, the tax laws currently in effect may change, and such changes may have retroactive effect. We have
inter-company arrangements in place providing for administrative and financing services and transfer pricing, which involve a significant
degree of judgment and are often subject to close review by tax authorities. The tax authorities may challenge our positions related
to these agreements. If the tax authorities successfully challenge our positions, our effective tax rate may increase, adversely
affecting our results of operation and our business. 

Our manufacturing operations are subject to environmental
regulation that could limit our growth or impose substantial costs, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of
operations.   

Our properties, operations and products
are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate and sell products. These laws and
regulations govern, among other things, air emissions, wastewater discharges, the management and disposal of hazardous materials,
the contamination of soil and groundwater, employee health and safety and the content, performance, packaging and disposal of products.
Our failure to comply with current and future environmental laws and regulations, or the identification of contamination for which
we are liable, could subject us to substantial costs, including fines, clean-up costs, third-party property damages or personal
injury claims, and make significant investments to upgrade our facilities or curtail our operations. Liability under environmental,
health and safety laws can be joint and several and without regard to fault or negligence. For example, pursuant to environmental
laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or
CERCLA, we may be liable for the full amount of any remediation-related costs at properties we currently own or formerly owned,
such as our currently owned Sugar Land, Texas facility, or at properties at which we operated, as well as at properties we will
own or operate in the future, and properties to which we have sent hazardous substances, whether or not we caused the contamination.
Identification of presently unidentified environmental conditions, more vigorous enforcement by a governmental authority, enactment
of more stringent legal requirements or other unanticipated events could give rise to adverse publicity, restrict our operations,
affect the design or marketability of our products or otherwise cause us to incur material environmental costs, adversely affecting
our financial condition and results of operations. 

We are exposed to risks and increased expenses and business
risk as a result of Restriction on Hazardous Substances, or RoHS directives.   

Following the lead of the European Union,
or EU, various governmental agencies have either already put into place or are planning to introduce regulations that regulate
the permissible levels of hazardous substances in products sold in various regions of the world. For example, the RoHS directive
for EU took effect on July 1, 2006. The labeling provisions of similar legislation in China went into effect on March 1, 2007.
Consequently, many suppliers of products sold into the EU have required their suppliers to be compliant with the new directive.
Many of our customers have adopted this approach and have required our full compliance. Though we have devoted a significant amount
of resources and effort in planning and executing our RoHS program, it is possible that some of our products might be incompatible
with such regulations. In such events, we could experience the following consequences: loss of revenue, damages reputation, diversion
of resources, monetary penalties, and legal action. 

Failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.   

We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act which generally prohibits U.S. companies from engaging in bribery or other prohibited payments to foreign officials
for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly
represent our transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Foreign companies, including some that
may compete with us, may not be subject to these prohibitions, and therefore may have a competitive advantage over us. If we are
not successful in implementing and maintaining adequate preventative measures, we may be responsible for acts of our employees
or other agents engaging in such conduct. We could suffer severe penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 

We are subject to governmental export and import controls
that could subject us to liability or impair our ability to compete in international markets.   

We are subject to export and import control
laws, trade regulations and other trade requirements that limit which products we sell and where and to whom we sell our products.
Specifically, the Bureau of Industry and Security of the U.S. Department of Commerce is responsible for regulating the export of
most commercial items that are so called dual-use goods that may have both commercial and military applications. A limited number
of our products are exported by license under the Export Control Classification Number, or ECCN, of 5A991. Export Control Classification
requirements are dependent upon an item s technical characteristics, the destination, the end-use, and the end-user, and
other activities of the end-user. Should the regulations applicable to our products change, or the restrictions applicable to countries
to which we ship our products change, then the export of our products to such countries could be restricted. As a result, our ability
to export or sell our products to certain countries could be restricted, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition
and results of operations. Changes in our products or any change in export or import regulations or related legislation, shift
in approach to the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, persons or technologies targeted by
such regulations, could result in delayed or decreased sales of our products to existing or potential customers. In such event,
our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 

Rapidly changing standards and regulations could make
our products obsolete, which would cause our revenue and results of operations to suffer.   

We design our products to conform to regulations
established by governments and to standards set by industry standards bodies worldwide, such as the American National Standards
Institute, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute, the International Telecommunications Union and the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. Various industry organizations are currently considering whether and to what extent
to create standards applicable to our products. Because certain of our products are designed to conform to current specific industry
standards, if competing or new standards emerge that are preferred by our customers, we would have to make significant expenditures
to develop new products. If our customers adopt new or competing industry standards with which our products are not compatible,
or the industry groups adopt standards or governments issue regulations with which our products are not compatible, our existing
products would become less desirable to our customers and our revenue and results of operations would suffer. 

Compliance with regulations related to conflict minerals
could increase costs and affect the manufacturing and sale of our products.   

Public companies are required
to disclose the use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold (collectively,  conflict minerals ) mined from
the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries (the  covered countries ) if a conflict mineral(s)
is necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by the company. We filed our
initial conflict minerals report on Form SD on May 31, 2016. We may determine, as part of our compliance efforts, that
certain products or components we obtain from our suppliers contain conflict minerals. If we are unable to conclude that all
our products are free from conflict minerals originating from covered countries, this could have a negative impact on our
business, reputation and/or results of operations. We may also encounter challenges to satisfy customers who require that our
products be certified as conflict free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to substantiate
such a claim. Compliance with these rules could also affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals used in the
manufacture of products or components we obtain from our suppliers, including our ability to obtain products or components in
sufficient quantities and/or at competitive prices. Certain of our customers are requiring additional information from us
regarding the origin of our raw materials, and complying with these customer requirements may cause us to incur additional
costs, such as costs related to determining the origin of any minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and
we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. We may also encounter challenges with our
customers and stockholders if we are unable to certify that our products are conflict free. 

Risks Related to Our Operations in China  

Our business operations conducted in China are critical to our
success. A total of $20.6 million, $22.0 million and $31.9 million or 11.0% 16.9% and 40.6%, of our revenue in the years ended December
31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was attributable to our product manufacturing plants in China, respectively. Additionally, a substantial
portion of our property, plant and equipment, 22% and 26% as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, was located in China, respectively.
We expect to make further investments in China in the foreseeable future. Therefore, our business, financial condition, results
of operations and prospects are to a significant degree subject to economic, political, legal, and social events and developments
in China. 

Adverse changes in economic and political policies in
China, or Chinese laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on business conditions and the overall economic growth
of China, which could adversely affect our business.   

The Chinese economy differs from the economies
of most developed countries in many respects, including the level of government involvement, level of development, growth rate,
control of foreign exchange and allocation of resources. The Chinese economy has been transitioning from a planned economy to a
more market-oriented economy. Despite reforms, the government continues to exercise significant control over China s economic
growth by way of the allocation of resources, control over foreign currency-denominated obligations and monetary policy and provision
of preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. 

In addition, the laws, regulations and legal
requirements in China, including the laws that apply to foreign-invested enterprises, or FIEs, are subject to frequent changes.
The interpretation and enforcement of such laws is uncertain. Protections of intellectual property rights and confidentiality in
China may not be as effective as in the U.S. or other countries or regions with more developed legal systems. Any litigation in
China may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention. Any adverse changes
to these laws, regulations and legal requirements or their interpretation or enforcement could have a material adverse effect on
our business. 

Furthermore, while China s economy
has experienced rapid growth in the past 20 years, growth has been uneven across different regions, among various economic
sectors and over time. China has also in the past and may in the future experience economic downturns due to, for example, government
austerity measures, changes in government policies relating to capital spending, limitations placed on the ability of commercial
banks to make loans, reduced levels of exports and international trade, inflation, lack of financial liquidity, stock market volatility
and global economic conditions. Any of these developments could contribute to a decline in business and consumer spending in addition
to other adverse market conditions, which could adversely affect our business. 

The termination and expiration or unavailability of our
preferential tax treatments in China may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.   

Prior to January 1, 2008, entities
established in China were generally subject to a 30% state and 3% local enterprise income tax rate. In accordance with the China
Income Tax Law for Enterprises with Foreign Investment and Foreign Enterprises, effective through December 31, 2007, our China
subsidiary enjoyed preferential income tax rates. Effective January 1, 2008, the China Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT
law, imposes a single uniform income tax rate of 25% on all Chinese enterprises, including FIEs, and eliminates or modifies most
of the tax exemptions, reductions and preferential treatment available under the previous tax laws and regulations. As a result,
our China subsidiary may be subject to the uniform income tax rate of 25% unless we are able to qualify for preferential status.
Currently, we have qualified for a preferential 15% tax rate that is available for state-encouraged new high technology enterprises.
The preferential rate has applied to calendar years 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012. We have not yet realized any benefit from the 10%
reduction in income tax rate due to losses incurred by our China subsidiary; however, if we fail to continue to qualify for this
preferential rate in the future, we may incur higher tax rates on our income in China. In order to retain the preferential tax
rate, we must meet certain operating conditions, satisfy certain product requirements, meet certain headcount requirements and
maintain certain levels of research expenditures. We applied for an additional three years of preferential status with the Chinese
government in 2014 and received approval as a high-technology enterprise through September 2017. Any future increase in the enterprise
income tax rate applicable to us or the expiration or other limitation of preferential tax rates available to us could increase
our tax liabilities and reduce our net income. 

China regulation of loans to and direct investment by
offshore holding companies in China entities may delay or prevent us from making loans or additional capital contributions to our
China subsidiary.   

Any loans that we wish to make to our China
subsidiary are subject to China regulations and approvals. For example, any loans to our China subsidiary to finance their activities
cannot exceed statutory limits, must be registered with State Administration of Foreign Exchange, or SAFE, or its local counterpart,
and must be approved by the relevant government authorities. Any capital contributions to our China subsidiary must be approved
by the Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart. In addition, under Circular 142, our China subsidiary, as a FIE, may not
be able to convert our capital contributions to them into RMB for equity investments or acquisitions in China. 

We cannot assure you that we will be able
to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to our future loans or capital
contributions to our China subsidiary. If we fail to receive such registrations or approvals, our ability to capitalize our China
subsidiary may be negatively affected, which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and ability to fund and expand
our business. 

Our China subsidiary is subject to Chinese labor laws
and regulations and Chinese labor laws may increase our operating costs in China.   

The China Labor Contract Law, together with
its implementing rules, provides increased rights to Chinese employees. Previously, an employer had discretionary power in deciding
the probation period, not to exceed six months. Additionally, the employment contract could only be terminated for cause. Under
these rules, the probation period varies depending on contract terms and the employment contract can only be terminated during
the probation period for cause upon three days  notice. Additionally, an employer may not be able to terminate a contract
during the probation period on the grounds of a material change of circumstances or a mass layoff. The law also has specific provisions
on conditions when an employer has to sign an employment contract with open-ended terms. If an employer fails to enter into an
open-ended contract in certain circumstances, the employer must pay the employee twice their monthly wage beginning from the time
the employer should have executed an open-ended contract. Additionally, an employer must pay severance for nearly all terminations,
including when an employer decides not to renew a fixed-term contract. These laws may increase our costs and reduce our flexibility. 

The turnover of direct labor in manufacturing industries
in China is high, which could adversely affect our production, shipments and results of operations.   

Employee turnover of direct labor in the
manufacturing sector in China is high and retention of such personnel is a challenge to companies located in or with operations
in China. Although direct labor costs do not represent a high proportion of our overall manufacturing costs, direct labor is required
for the manufacture of our products. If our direct labor turnover rates are higher than we expect, or we otherwise fail to adequately
manage our direct labor turnover rates, then our results of operations could be adversely affected. 

An increase in our labor costs in China may adversely
affect our business and our profitability.   

A significant portion of our workforce is
located in China. Labor costs in China have been increasing recently due to labor unrest, strikes and changes in employment laws.
If labor costs in China continue to increase, our costs will increase. If we are not able to pass these increases on to our customers,
our business, profitability and results of operations may be adversely affected. 

We may have difficulty establishing and maintaining adequate
management and financial controls over our China operations.   

Businesses in China have historically not
adopted a western style of management and financial reporting concepts and practices, which includes strong corporate governance,
internal controls and computer, financial and other control systems. Moreover, familiarity with U.S. GAAP principles and reporting
procedures is less common in China. As a consequence, we may have difficulty finding accounting personnel experienced with U.S. GAAP,
and we may have difficulty training and integrating our China-based accounting staff with our U.S.-based finance organization.
As a result of these factors, we may experience difficulty in establishing management and financial controls over our China operations.
These difficulties include collecting financial data and preparing financial statements, books of account and corporate records
and instituting business practices that meet U.S. public-company reporting requirements. We may, in turn, experience difficulties
in implementing and maintaining adequate internal controls as required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock  

Our stock price has been and is likely to be volatile.   

The market price of our common stock has
been and is likely to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, among other things, the risk factors described in this section
of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and other factors beyond our control, such as fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived
by investors to be comparable to us. 

Furthermore, the stock markets have experienced
price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies.
These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market
and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions, such as recessions, interest rate changes
or international currency fluctuations, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock. 

In the past, many companies that have experienced
volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may become the target
of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s
attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business. 

We have incurred and will continue to incur significant
increased expenses and administrative burdens as a public company, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations
and financial results.   

We face increased legal, accounting, administrative
and other costs and expenses as a public company that we did not incur as a private company, and greater expenditures may be necessary
in the future with the advent of new laws, regulations and stock exchange listing requirements pertaining to public companies.
These increased costs will require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to expand our business
and achieve our strategic objectives. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including the requirements of Section 404, as well as rules and regulations
subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and the NASDAQ Global Market, impose additional
reporting and other obligations on public companies. Compliance with public company requirements has increased our costs and made
some activities more time-consuming. For example, we have created board committees and adopted internal controls and disclosure
controls and procedures. In addition, we will have incurred and will continue to incur additional expenses associated with our
SEC reporting requirements. Furthermore, if we identify any issues in complying with those requirements (for example, if we or
our auditors identify a material weakness or significant deficiency in our internal control over financial reporting), we could
incur additional costs rectifying those issues, and the existence of those issues could adversely affect us, our reputation or
investor perceptions of us. Advocacy efforts by stockholders and third parties may also prompt additional changes in governance
and reporting requirements, which could further increase our costs. 

We currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common
stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates.   

We currently do not plan to declare or pay
dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our loan and security agreement with
East West Bank and Comerica Bank restrict our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return
on any shares of our common stock that you may acquire will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell
your shares at a profit. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock in the market will ever exceed the price that
you pay. 

Our charter documents, stock incentive plans and Delaware
law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.   

Our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and our stock incentive plans contain provisions that could delay or prevent
a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and
take other corporate actions. These provisions include: 

providing for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;   

not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;   

authorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock rights senior to those of common stock;   

prohibiting stockholder action by written consent;   

limiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders;   

requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals; and   

change of control provisions in our stock incentive plans, and the individual stock option agreements, which provide that a change of control may accelerate the vesting of the stock options issued under such plans.   

In addition, we are governed by the provisions
of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those
owning 15% or more of our outstanding common stock, from engaging in certain business combinations without the approval of substantially
all of our stockholders for a certain period of time. 

These and other provisions in our amended
and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover
attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future and result in the
market price being lower than it would be without these provisions. 

Some provisions of our named executive officers 
agreements regarding change of control or separation of service contain obligations for us to make separation payments to them
upon their termination.   

Certain provisions contained in our employment
agreements with our named executive officers regarding change of control or separation of service may obligate us to make lump
sum severance payments and related payments upon the termination of their employment with us, other than such executive officer s
resignation without good reason or our termination of their employment as a result of their disability or for cause. In the event
we are required to make these separation payments, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the
fiscal period in which such payments are made. 

If research analysts do not publish research about our
business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.   

The trading market for our common stock depends on the research and reports that research analysts publish about us and our business. The price of our common stock
could decline if one or more research analysts downgrade our common stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary
or cease publishing reports about us or our business. If one or more of the research analysts ceases coverage of our company or
fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume
to decline. 

As an  emerging growth company  within the
meaning of the Securities Act, we utilize certain modified disclosure requirements, and we cannot be certain if these reduced
requirements will make our common stock less attractive to investors.   

We are an emerging growth company
within the meaning of the rules under the Securities Act. We have in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q utilized, and we plan
in future filings with the SEC to continue to utilize, the modified disclosure requirements available to emerging growth
companies, including reduced disclosure about our executive compensation and omission of compensation discussion and
analysis, and an exemption from the requirement of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and an
exemption from the requirement that outside auditors attest as to our internal control over financial reporting. As a result,
our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS
Act also provides that an emerging growth company can utilize the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption
of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to utilize this
extended transition period. Our financial statements may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such
new or revised accounting standards as they become applicable to public companies. 

We cannot predict if investors will find
our common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive
as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We could
remain an  emerging growth company  for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
fiscal year in which our annual gross revenue exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated
filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that
is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter
or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year
period.
