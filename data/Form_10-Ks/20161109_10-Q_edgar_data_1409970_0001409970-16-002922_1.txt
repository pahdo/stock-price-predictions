1. Basis of Presentation 
    
  LendingClub Corporation (Lending Club) is an online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors. LC Advisors, LLC (LCA), is a registered investment advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and wholly-owned subsidiary of Lending Club that acts as the general partner for certain private funds and advisor to separately managed accounts (SMAs) and a fund of which its wholly-owned subsidiary RV MP Fund GP, LLC, is the general partner. Springstone Financial, LLC (Springstone), is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lending Club that facilitates education and patient finance loans. LC Trust I (the Trust) is an independent Delaware business trust that acquires loans from Lending Club and holds them for the sole benefit of certain investors that have purchased a trust certificate (Certificate) issued by the Trust and that are related to specific underlying loans for the benefit of the investor. 
    
  Although the Company's overall business model remains premised on the Company not using its balance sheet and not assuming credit risk for loans facilitated through our marketplace, the Company may use its capital to support contractual obligations (Pool B loans and repurchase obligations), regulatory commitments (direct mail), short-term marketplace equilibrium, customer accommodations, or other needs. The Company's use of its capital on the platform from time to time has been, and will be, on terms that are substantially similar to other investors. Additionally, the Company may use its capital to invest in loans associated with the testing or initial launch of new or alternative loan terms, programs or channels to establish a track record of performance prior to facilitating third-party investments in these loans.  
    
  With the announcement of the initial results of the internal board review on May 9, 2016 and additional findings disclosed on June 28, 2016, many investors paused or reduced their investment activity. The Company has been focused on working with these investors to resume their investment activity and on bringing new investors to the platform. During the second quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2016 through August 31, 2016 the Company offered incentives to investors in exchange for investment activity. The Company ended these incentives in August of 2016 and did not offer these incentives to investors for investments in loans in the month of September 2016. Additionally, the Company did not have to use a material amount of its own capital to purchase loans in the third quarter of 2016. The Company may enter into strategic arrangements, for example, agreements that involve larger or more long-term forms of committed capital. On November 7, 2016 the Company announced a new addition to the Company s investor capital mix through an arrangement with a subsidiary of the National Bank of Canada which has approved up to   $1.3 billion   to be deployed on the Lending Club platform. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the first   $325 million   has been committed to be deployed on the platform over the next three months.   
    
  The failure of the Company to attract investor capital may result in the Company using a greater amount of its own capital to purchase loans on the platform compared to prior periods, or reduce origination volume which could have material adverse impacts on the Company's business, financial condition (including its liquidity), results of operations or ability to sustain and grow loan volume. 
    
  The Company believes, based on its projections and ability to reduce loan volume if needed, that its cash on hand, funds available from its line of credit, and its cash flow from operations are sufficient to meet its liquidity needs for the next twelve months. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include Lending Club, its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Company, we, or us) and the Trust. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial information necessary for the fair statement of the results and financial position for the periods presented. These accounting principles require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts in the

  (Unaudited) 

accompanying financial statements. These condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the periods presented. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. Actual results may differ from those estimates, and results reported in the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year or any other interim period. 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company disaggregated the expense previously reported as  General and administrative  into  Engineering and product development  and  Other general and administrative  expense. Additionally, the Company reclassified certain operating expenses between  Sales and marketing,   Origination and servicing,   Engineering and product development  and  Other general and administrative  expense to align such classification and presentation with how the Company currently manages the operations and these expenses. These changes had no impact to  Total operating expenses.  Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. 
    
  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements and these related notes should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (Annual Report) and Form 10-K/A filed on May 17, 2016. The Company's significant accounting policies are included in    Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.    

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  The Company's significant accounting policies are discussed in    Part II   Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in the Annual Report. There have been no significant changes to these significant accounting policies for the nine month period ended   September 30, 2016  , except as noted below. 
    
  Transaction Fee Revenue  
    
  Transaction fees are paid by issuing banks or patient service providers to Lending Club for the work Lending Club performs through its platform and Springstone s platform in facilitating loans for its issuing bank partners. These fees are recognized as a component of operating revenue at the time of loan issuance. Factors affecting the amount of fees paid to the issuing bank by the borrower and from the bank to the Company include initial loan amount, term, credit quality, and other factors. 
    
  Commencing with the origination fee increase announced in March 2016, in the event a borrower prepays a loan in full before maturity, the Company assumes the issuing bank partner's obligation under Utah law to refund the pro-rated amount of the fee received by the bank in excess of   5%  . Additionally, the Company may provide refunds to patient finance borrowers when the borrower cancels the loan under certain conditions. Since Lending Club can estimate refunds based on loan cancellation or prepayment experience, the Company records transaction fee revenue net of estimated refunds at the time of loan issuance. 
    
  Restricted Cash 
    
  Restricted cash consists primarily of checking, money market and certificate of deposit accounts that are: (i) pledged to or held in escrow by the Company s correspondent banks as security for transactions processed on or related to Lending Club s platform or activities by certain investors; (ii) pledged through a credit support agreement with a certificate holder; (iii) held in a Rabbi Trust through a grantor trust agreement to satisfy obligations to participants under the Company s 2016 Cash Retention Bonus Plan ( Cash Retention Plan ). See    Note 13   Employee Incentive and Retirement Plans    for additional information, or (iv) received from investors but not yet applied to their accounts on the platform and transferred to segregated bank accounts that hold investors  funds.

  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 
  (Unaudited) 

Investor cash balances (excluding transactions-in-process) are held in segregated bank or custodial accounts and are not commingled with the Company s monies or held on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  Loans Held for Sale 
    
  Loans held by the Company with the intent to sell are reflected on the balance sheet as loans held for sale. Loans held for sale are accounted for at fair value. The Company s fair value methodology for the measurement of loans held for sale is consistent with that of loans not classified as held for sale. The fair valuation methodology considers projected prepayments and uses the historical actual defaults, losses and recoveries on our loans to project future losses and net cash flows on loans. The fair value adjustments related to loans held for sale are recorded in the period of the fair value changes. 
    
  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities 
    
  A variable interest entity (VIE) is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its own operations, whose equity holders do not have the power to direct the activities most significantly affecting the economic outcome of those activities, or whose equity holders do not share proportionately in the losses or receive the residual returns of the entity. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE requires a significant amount of judgment. When the Company has a controlling financial interest in a VIE, it must consolidate the results of the VIE s operations into its condensed consolidated financial statements. A controlling financial interest exists if the Company has both the power to direct the VIE s activities that most significantly affect the VIE s economic performance (power) and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE (economics). 
    
  LC Trust I 
    
  The Company has determined that the Trust is a VIE and that the Company has a controlling financial interest in the Trust and therefore must consolidate the Trust in its condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company established the Trust in February 2011 and funded it with a nominal residual investment. The Company is the only residual investor in the Trust. The purpose of the Trust is to acquire and hold loans for the benefit of investors who have invested in certificates issued by the Trust. The Trust conducts no other business other than purchasing and retaining loans or portions thereof for the benefit of the investment funds and their underlying limited partners. The Trust holds loans, none of which are financed by the Company. The cash flows from the loans held by the Trust are used to repay obligations under the certificates. The Trust s assets and liabilities were reflected in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
    
  In connection with the formation of the investment funds, it was determined that in order to achieve success in raising investment capital, the assets to be invested in by the investment funds must be held by an entity that was separate and distinct from the Company (i.e. bankruptcy remote) in order to reduce this risk and uncertainty. In the event of the Company's insolvency, it is anticipated that the assets of the Trust would not become part of the bankruptcy estate, but that outcome is uncertain. 
    
  The Company's capital contributions, which are the only equity investments in the Trust, are insufficient to allow the Trust to finance the purchase of a significant amount of loans without the issuance of certificates to investors. Therefore, the Trust s capitalization level qualifies the Trust as a VIE. The Company has a financial interest in the Trust because of its right to returns related to servicing fee revenue from the Trust, its right to reimbursement for expenses, and its obligation to repurchase loans from the Trust in certain instances. Additionally, the Company performs or directs activities that significantly affect the Trust s economic performance through or by (i) operation of the platform that enables borrowers to apply for loans purchased by the Trust; (ii) credit underwriting and  
  
   10 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 
  (Unaudited) 

servicing of loans purchased by the Trust; (iii) LCA's selection of the loans that are purchased by the Trust on behalf of advised Certificate holders; and (iv) LCA s role to source investors that ultimately purchase limited partnership interests in a fund or Certificates, both of which supply the funds for the Trust to purchase loans. Collectively, the activities described above allow the Company to fund more loans than would be the case without the existence of the Trust, to collect the related loan transaction fees and for LCA to collect the management fees on the investors  capital used to purchase certificates. Accordingly, the Company is deemed to have power to direct activities most significant to the Trust and economic interest in the activities because of loan funding and transaction and management fees. Therefore, the Company concluded that it is the primary beneficiary of the Trust and consolidated the Trust s operations in its condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Investment In Cirrix Capital 
    
  On April 1, 2016, the Company closed its   $10.0 million   investment, for an approximate ownership interest of   15%   in Cirrix Capital (Investment Fund), a holding company to a family of funds that purchases loans and interests in loans from the Company. Per the partnership agreement, the family of funds can invest up to   20%   of their assets outside of whole loans and interests in whole loans facilitated by the Company. At   September 30, 2016  ,   100%   of the family of funds' assets were comprised of whole loans and interests in loans facilitated by Lending Club's platform. At the time the Company made its investment, the Company's then Chief Executive Officer (former CEO) and a board member (together, the Related Party Investors) also had limited partnership interests in the Investment Fund that resulted in an aggregate ownership of approximately   29%   in the Investment Fund by the Related Party Investors and the Company. As of September 30, 2016, the Company and a board member had an aggregate ownership interest of approximately   27%   in the Investment Fund. 
    
  The Company's investment is deemed to be a variable interest in the Investment Fund because of the limited partnership interest shares in the expected returns and losses of the Investment Fund. The expected returns and losses of the Investment Fund result from the net returns of the family of funds owned by the Investment Fund, which are derived from interest income earned from loans and interests in whole loans that are purchased by the family of funds, which are owned by the Investment Fund. Such loans and interests in loans were facilitated by the Company. Additionally, the Investment Fund is considered a VIE.  
    
  The Investment Fund passes along credit risk to the limited partners. The Company did not design the Investment Fund s investment strategy and cannot require the Investment Fund to purchase loans. Additionally, the Company reviewed whether it collectively, with the board member's investment, had power to control the Investment Fund and concluded that it did not based on the unilateral ability of the general partner to exercise power over the limited partnership and the inability of the limited partners to remove the general partner. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of the Investment Fund because the Company does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the Investment Fund s economic performance. As a result, the Company does not consolidate the operations of the Investment Fund in the financial statements of the Company. The Company accounts for this investment under the equity method of accounting, which approximates its maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement in the Investment Fund. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company's investment was   $10.1 million  , which was recorded in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. See    Note 17   Related Party Transactions    for additional information. 
    
  Separately, the Company is subject to a credit support agreement that requires it to pledge and restrict cash in support of its contingent obligation to reimburse the Investment Fund for net credit losses on loans underlying the interests in whole loans that are in excess of a specified, aggregate net loss threshold. This credit support agreement is deemed to be a variable interest in the Investment Fund because it exposes the Company to potential credit losses on the underlying interests in loans purchased by the Investment Fund. The board member and the Company are excluded from receiving any benefits, if provided, from this credit support agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not been required to nor does it anticipate recording losses under this agreement. The Company's

maximum exposure to loss under this credit support agreement was limited to   $6.0 million   and   $34.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  LCA Managed or Advised Private Funds 
    
  In conjunction with the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends accounting for consolidations effective January 1, 2016, the Company reviewed its relationship with the private funds managed or advised by LCA and concluded that it does not have a variable interest in the private funds. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company does not hold any investments in the private funds. Certain of the Company's related parties have investments in the private funds, as discussed in    Note 17   Related Party Transactions.    The Company charges the limited partners in the private funds a management fee based on their account balance at month end for services performed as the general manager, including fund administration, and audit, accounting and tax preparation services. Accordingly, the Company's fee arrangements contain only terms, conditions, or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services negotiated at arm s length. These fees are solely compensation for services provided and are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. The Company does not have any other interests in the private funds and therefore does not have a variable interest in the private funds. 
    
  Management regularly reviews and reconsiders its previous conclusions regarding whether it holds a variable interest in potential VIEs, the status of an entity as a VIE, and whether the Company is required to consolidate such VIEs in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Loan Servicing Rights 
    
  As a result of the nature of servicing rights on the sale of loans, the Company is a variable interest holder in certain entities that purchase these loans. For all of these entities, the Company either does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance or does not have a potentially significant economic interest in the VIE. In no case is the Company the primary beneficiary, and as a result, these entities are not consolidated in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Loan Trailing Fee Liability 
    
  In February 2016, the Company revised the agreement with its primary issuing bank to include an additional program fee (Loan Trailing Fee). The Loan Trailing Fee is dependent on the amount and timing of principal and interest payments made by borrowers of the underlying loans, and gives the issuing bank an ongoing financial interest in the performance of the loans it originates. This fee is paid by the Company to the issuing bank partner over the term of the respective loans and is a function of the principal and interest payments. In the event that principal and interest payments are not made, the Company is not required to make this Loan Trailing Fee payment. The Loan Trailing Fee is recorded at fair value with the initial establishment, and any changes, of this liability are netted against transaction fees on the Company's condensed consolidated statement of operations. The fair value of the Loan Trailing Fee represents the present value of the expected monthly Loan Trailing Fee, which considers assumptions of expected prepayment rates and future credit losses.  
    
  Debt 
    
  The Company has elected to record certain costs directly related to its secured revolving credit facility as an asset included in other assets on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. These costs are amortized as interest expense over the contractual term of the secured revolving credit facility. Additionally, in instances where the Company transfers loans to investors that do not meet sale criteria for accounting purposes, such loan sales are accounted for as secured borrowings.

Adoption of New Accounting Standard 
    
  In February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2015-02 Consolidation (Topic 810):   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , which was effective January 1, 2016. The guidance changes what an investor must consider in determining whether it is required to consolidate an entity in which it holds an interest. The adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, earnings per share (EPS) or cash flows. 
    
  New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15 Statement of Cash Flows -   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which will be effective January 1, 2018, and amends the existing accounting standards for the statement of cash flows. The amendments provide guidance on the following eight cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and, separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of these amendments on its cash flows. 
  In June 2016, the FASB amended guidance related to impairment of financial instruments as part of ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326):   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which will be effective January 1, 2020. The guidance replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with an expected credit loss model for which a company recognizes an allowance based on the estimate of expected credit loss. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its financial position, results of operations, EPS and cash flows.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718):   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which will be effective January 1, 2017. The guidance simplifies the accounting for share-based payments related to the income tax consequences of share-based awards, the classification of awards in a company's financial statements, and estimating forfeitures of awards. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its financial position, results of operations, EPS and cash flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842) that amended guidance related to the lease accounting, which will be effective January 1, 2019. The guidance requires an entity to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for most lease arrangements. The standard also requires additional disclosures related to lease arrangements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its financial position, results of operations, EPS, and cash flows.  
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01 Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic: 825-10):   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which will be effective January 1, 2018. The amendment changes the accounting for equity investments, changes disclosure requirements related to instruments at amortized cost and fair value, and clarifies how entities should evaluate deferred tax assets for securities classified as available for sale. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its financial position, results of operations, EPS, and cash flows.  
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15 Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40),   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  , which requires management to assess a company s ability to continue as a going concern for each annual and interim reporting

period, and disclose in its financial statements whether there is substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The new standard applies to all companies and is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter. The Company does not believe adoption of this accounting standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which will be effective January 1, 2018. The guidance clarifies that revenue from contracts with customers should be recognized in a manner that depicts both the likelihood of payment and the timing of the related transfer of goods or performance of services. In March 2016, the FASB issued an amendment (ASU 2016-08) to the new revenue recognition guidance clarifying how to determine if an entity is a principal or agent in a transaction. In April (ASU 2016-10) and May (ASU 2016-12) of 2016, the FASB further amended the guidance to include performance obligation identification, licensing implementation, collectability assessment and other presentation and transition clarifications. The effective date and transition requirements for this amendment is the same as those for the new revenue guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its financial position, results of operations, EPS and cash flows.

  Loans, Loans Held For Sale, Notes and Certificates 
    
  The Company sells loans and issues notes and the Trust issues certificates as a means to allow investors to invest in the associated loans. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , loans, notes and certificates measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows: 

Loans invested in by the Company for which there was no associated note or certificate, had an aggregate principal balance outstanding of   $34.2 million   and a fair value of   $33.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  At September 30, 2016 the aggregate principal balance outstanding and fair value of the Company s loans held for sale were $  14.9 million   and $  14.7 million  , respectively.  
    
  The Company places all loans for all loan products that are contractually past due by   120   days or more on non-accrual status. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , loans that were   90 days   or more past due (including non-accrual loans) were as follows: 

For all standard and custom personal loan products, the Company's charge-off policy is to charge off loans after   120   days and no later than   150   days past due, or earlier in the event of notification of borrower bankruptcy.

As the Company's loans and related notes and certificates, loans held for sale, loan servicing rights, and Loan Trailing Fee liability do not trade in an active market with readily observable prices, the Company uses significant unobservable inputs to measure the fair value of these assets and liabilities. Financial instruments are categorized in the valuation hierarchy based on the significance of unobservable factors in the overall fair value measurement. These fair value estimates may also include observable, actively quoted components derived from external sources. As a result, changes in fair value for assets and liabilities within the Level 2 or Level 3 categories may include changes in fair value that were attributable to both observable and unobservable inputs.  The Company did not transfer any assets or liabilities in or out of Level 3 during the   first nine months of     2016   or the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Significant Unobservable Inputs 
    
  The following tables present quantitative information about the significant unobservable inputs used for the Company's Level 3 fair value measurements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

N/A  Not applicable 
            (1)    
    Expressed as a percentage of the original principal balance of the loan, note or certificate. 
               (2)    
    Includes collection fees estimated to be paid to a hypothetical third-party servicer. 
               (3)    
    Excludes collection fees that would be passed on to a hypothetical third-party servicer. As of December 31, 2015, the market rate for collection fees was assumed to be 7 basis points for a weighted-average total market servicing rate of 57 basis points. 
               (4)    
    Includes loans held for sale. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the discounted cash flow methodology used to estimate the notes and certificates' fair values used the same projected net cash flows as their related loans. As demonstrated by the following tables below, the fair value adjustments for loans were largely offset by the fair value adjustments of the notes and certificates due to the payment dependent design of the notes and certificates and because the principal balances of the loans were very close to the combined principal balances of the notes and certificates. 
    
  The following tables present additional information about Level 3 loans, loans held for sale, notes and certificates measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the   third quarters   and   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  :

The following table presents additional information about Level 3 Loan Trailing Fee liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2016  : 

Significant Recurring Level 3 Fair Value Asset and Liability Input Sensitivity 
    
  Certain fair valuation adjustments recorded through earnings, related to Level 3 instruments for the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  . Generally, changes in the net cumulative expected loss rates, cumulative prepayment rates, and discount rates will have an immaterial net impact on the fair value of loans, notes and certificates, servicing assets and liabilities, and Loan Trailing Fees. 
    
  Certain of these unobservable inputs may (in isolation) have either a directionally consistent or opposite impact on the fair value of the financial instrument for a given change in that input. When multiple inputs are used within the valuation techniques for loans, notes and certificates, servicing assets and liabilities, and Loan Trailing Fees, a change in one input in a certain direction may be offset by an opposite change from another input. 
    
  A specific loan that is projected to have larger future default losses than previously estimated has lower expected future cash flows over its remaining life, which reduces its estimated fair value. Conversely, a specific loan that is projected to have smaller future default losses than previously estimated has increased expected future cash flows over its remaining life, which increases its estimated fair value.  
    
  The Company's selection of the most representative market servicing rates for servicing assets and servicing liabilities is inherently judgmental. The Company reviewed estimated third-party servicing rates for its loans and loans in similar credit sectors, as well as market servicing benchmarking analyses provided by third-party valuation firms. The table below shows the impact on the estimated fair value of servicing assets and liabilities, calculated using different market servicing rate assumptions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1)   
    Represents total market servicing rates, which include collection fees, at   September 30, 2016  , and base market servicing rates, which exclude collection fees, at   December 31, 2015  . As of December 31, 2015, the market rate for collection fees was assumed to be 7 basis points for a weighted-average total market servicing rate of 57 basis points.

9. Intangible Assets and Goodwill 
    
  Intangible Assets 
    
  The Company's intangible asset balance was   $27.4 million   and   $31.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Amortization expense associated with intangible assets for the   third quarter and first nine months of     2016   was   $1.2 million   and   $3.6 million  , respectively. Amortization expense associated with intangible assets for the   third quarter and first nine months of     2015   was   $1.3 million   and $  4.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  Goodwill 
    
  The Company's annual goodwill impairment testing date is April 1. In testing for potential impairment of goodwill, management performed an assessment of each of the Company's reporting units (generally defined as the Company's businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management). Only the education and patient finance reporting unit contains goodwill. Due to the complexity and effort required to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit in the second step of the analysis, the fair value estimates were based on preliminary analysis and assumptions as of the end of the second quarter of 2016. Accordingly, we recorded our best estimate of the impairment of   $35.4 million   during the second quarter of 2016. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis in the third quarter of 2016 and recorded an additional impairment of   $1.7 million   for a total charge of   $37.1 million   for the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, in conjunction with the annual impairment test, the Company decreased its estimates of future earnings for the education and patient finance reporting unit, observed decreases in valuation multiples (i.e. enterprise value to revenue, and enterprise value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)) for peer group companies, and observed a marked decrease in the Company's overall market capitalization due, in substantial part to the resignation of Renaud Laplanche as CEO and Chairman and the events leading up to his resignation. In addition, the Company is subject to litigation and other inquiries related to the events surrounding the resignation of Mr. Laplanche. The publicity resulting from these events has adversely affected the Company s brand. These factors were a contributor to the determination that the fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value.  
    
  The first step of the analysis is to compare the reporting unit s estimate fair value to its carrying value. Estimating the fair value of the education and patient finance reporting unit was a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments, particularly related to future cash flows, discount rates (including market risk premiums) and market valuation multiples, which as discussed above were impacted by a series of events in the second quarter of 2016. The fair value of the reporting unit was determined using the income approach and the market approach, each a commonly used valuation technique. The Company gave consideration to each valuation technique, as either technique can be an indicator of fair value. For the income approach, the Company estimated future cash flows and used such cash flows in a discounted cash flow model ( DCF model ). A DCF model was selected to be comparable to what would be used by market participants to estimate fair value. The DCF model incorporated expected future growth rates, terminal value amounts, and the applicable weighted-average cost of capital to discount estimated cash flows. The projections used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with the Company s current forecast and long-range plans for this reporting unit. For the market approach, the valuation of the reporting unit was based on an analysis of enterprise value to revenue and enterprise value to EBITDA valuation multiples. The peer group valuation multiples used in the analysis were selected based on management s judgment.  
    
  The second step of the analysis includes allocating the estimated fair value (determined in the first step) of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities to determine an implied fair value of goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in an acquisition. That is, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the unit (including

unrecognized intangibles such as provider relationships) as if the reporting unit had been acquired and the estimated fair value was the purchase price paid.   
    
  The Company did not record any goodwill impairment expense in either the third quarter or first nine months of 2015. 

10. Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities 
    
  Accrued expenses and other liabilities consist of the following:   

11. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
  Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) represents other cumulative gains and losses that are not reflected in earnings. The components of other comprehensive income (loss) were as follows:

Accumulated other comprehensive loss balances were as follows: 

12. Secured Borrowings 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company repurchased   $22.3 million   of near-prime loans from a single institutional investor that did not meet a non-credit, non-pricing requirement of the investor, of which   $15.1 million   were originally sold to the investor prior to March 31, 2016. As a result, these loans were accounted for as secured borrowings at March 31, 2016. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company resold the loans to a different investor at par. This subsequent transfer qualified for sale accounting treatment, and the loans were removed from the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet and the secured borrowings liability was reduced to   zero   in the second quarter of 2016. There were   no   secured borrowing liabilities as of   September 30, 2016  .  

13. Employee Incentive and Retirement Plans 
    
  The Company s equity incentive plans provide for granting stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees, consultants, officers and directors. In addition, the Company offers a retirement plan and an employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) to eligible employees. 
    
  Stock-based compensation expense was as follows for the periods presented:

The Company capitalized   $2.2 million   and   $1.3 million   of stock-based compensation expense associated with developing software for internal use during the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company capitalized   $6.2 million   and   $3.1 million   of stock-based compensation expense associated with developing software for internal use during the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  In addition, the Company recognized   $0   and   $62 thousand   in tax deficits from exercised stock options and RSUs during the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2016  . There was   no   net income tax benefit recognized relating to stock-based compensation expense and   no   tax benefits have been realized from exercised stock options and RSUs due to the full valuation allowance during the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2015  . 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016, the board of directors or the compensation committee of the board of directors, as appropriate, approved incentive retention awards to certain members of the executive management team and other key personnel. These incentive awards consisted of an aggregate of   $16.3 million   of RSUs and   $18.6 million   of cash. These incentive retention awards will be recognized as compensation expense ratably through May 2017. 
    
  The cash retention awards were granted under the Cash Retention Plan. Under the terms of the Cash Retention Plan, employees who received an award will be eligible to earn a cash retention bonus on the terms and in the amounts specified in their respective cash retention bonus award agreement, subject to continued services and other vesting requirements set forth in such agreement.

  The Company has   two   equity incentive plans: the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (2007 Plan) and the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (2014 Plan). Upon the Company s IPO in 2014, the 2007 Plan was terminated and all shares that remained available for future issuance under the 2007 Plan at that time were transferred to the 2014 Plan. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   26,642,089   options to purchase common stock granted under the 2007 Plan remain outstanding. As of   September 30, 2016  , the total number of shares reserved for future grants under the 2014 Plan was   26,525,701   shares, including shares transferred from the 2007 Plan.

Stock options granted during the   first nine months of     2016   included   265,987   shares of fully vested stock options granted in lieu of cash bonuses to be paid to certain employees for the 2015 performance period. In the third quarter of 2016, a portion of these options were modified and the cash bonuses were paid. 
    
  For the   first nine months of     2015  , the Company granted service-based stock options to purchase   1,164,929   shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of   $20.00   per option share, a weighted average grant date fair value of   $9.80   per option share and an aggregate estimated fair value of   $11.4 million  . 
    
  The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised was   $71.0 million   and   $75.3 million   for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The total fair value of stock options vested for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015   was   $25.4 million   and   $26.0 million  , respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to outstanding stock options was   $50.4 million  , which is expected to be recognized over the next   2.5   years. 
    
  The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted with the following assumptions:

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $212.5 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over the next   3.3   years.  
    
  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  The Company s ESPP allows eligible employees to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at a discount through payroll deductions, subject to plan limitations. Payroll deductions are accumulated during   six  -month offering periods. The purchase price for each share of common stock is   85%   of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock on the first business day of the offering period or on the last business day of the offering period. 
    
  The Company's employees purchased   721,918   shares of common stock under the ESPP during the   first nine months of     2016  . No shares were purchased during the   third quarter   of   2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   6,195,036   shares remain reserved for future issuance. The Company's employees purchased   211,256   shares under the ESPP during the   third quarter   and   first nine months of   2015. 
    
  The fair value of stock purchase rights granted to employees under the ESPP is measured on the grant date using the 
  Black-Scholes option pricing model. The compensation expense related to ESPP purchase rights is recognized on a 
  straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the   6  -month requisite service period. On May 11, 2016 and June 11, 2015, we used the following assumptions in estimating the fair value of the grant under the ESPP which are derived using the same methodology applied to stock option assumptions: 

Share Repurchases 
    
  On   February 9, 2016  , the board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which Lending Club may repurchase up to   $150.0 million   of the Company s common shares   in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Securities and Exchange Act Rule 10b-18  .   This repurchase plan is valid for   one   year and does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and may be suspended at any time at Lending Club s discretion. In the first quarter of   2016  , the Company repurchased   2,282,720   shares of its common stock at a   weighted average purchase price of   $8.52   per share for an aggregate purchase price of   $19.5 million  . There were   no   shares repurchased during the second quarter or   third quarter of     2016   and the Company does not currently intend to repurchase additional shares in the near term.  
    
  Retirement Plan 
    
  Upon completing   90   days of service, employees may participate in the Company s qualified retirement plan that is governed by section 401(k) of the IRS Code. Participants may elect to contribute a portion of their annual compensation up to the maximum limit allowed by federal tax law. In the   first quarter of     2016  , the Company approved an employer match of up to   4%   of an employee s eligible compensation with a maximum annual match of   $5,000   per employee. The total expense for the employer match for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015   was   $0.8 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. The total expense for the employer match for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015   was   $3.2 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively.

Severance Costs 
    
  On June 22, 2016, the Board of Directors (the "Board") of the Company approved a plan to reduce the number of employees, which includes payment of severance benefits to certain employees whose positions were affected. The plan authorized the reduction of up to   179   positions, or approximately   12%   of the Company's workforce. The purpose of the action was to reduce costs, streamline operations and more closely align staffing with anticipated loan volumes. As a result, the Company recorded   $2.7 million   in severance costs, which were comprised predominately of cash severance, and paid   $0.1 million   during the second quarter of 2016. All of the remaining   $2.6 million   of severance costs was paid in the third quarter of 2016.    No   such costs were recorded in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015 and first nine months of 2015.  
    
  The following table presents the Company's severance expense recorded in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: 

14. Income Taxes 
    
  For the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2016  , the Company recorded income tax benefit of   $0.2 million   and   $4.0 million  , respectively. For the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2015  , the Company recorded income tax expense of   $1.2 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively. The income tax benefit in the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2016   included the recognition of a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and the tax effects of unrealized gains credited to other comprehensive income associated with the Company's available for sale portfolio. In addition, the income tax benefit in the first nine months of 2016 included the tax effect of the impairment of tax deductible goodwill, which occurred during the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  The Company continues to recognize a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets. This determination was based on the assessment of the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the existing deferred tax assets. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the valuation allowance was   $35.4 million   and   $25.3 million  , respectively. 

15. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Operating Lease Commitments 
    
  The Company's corporate headquarters are located in San Francisco, California, and consist of approximately   169,000   square feet of space under lease agreements, the longest of which is expected to expire in   June 2022  . Under these lease agreements, the Company has an option to extend nearly all of the space for   five   years. 
    
  In April   2015  , the Company entered into a lease agreement for approximately   112,000   square feet of additional office space in San Francisco, California. The lease agreement commenced in the second quarter of   2015   with  
  
   32 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted) 
  (Unaudited) 

delivery of portions of the leased space to occur in stages through March 2017. The lease agreement expires on   March 31, 2026  , with the right to renew the lease term for   two   consecutive renewal terms of   five years   each. 
    
  The Company has additional leased office space of approximately   26,000   square feet in Westborough, Massachusetts, under a lease agreement that expires in   July 2021  . 
    
  Total facilities rental expense for the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2016   was   $3.7 million   and   $10.5 million  , respectively. Total facilities rental expense for the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2015   was   $2.0 million   and   $5.0 million  , respectively. Minimum lease payments for the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2016   was   $3.4 million   and   $8.3 million  , respectively. Minimum lease payments for the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2015   was   $1.5 million   and   $4.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company pledged   $0.8 million   of cash and   $4.7 million   in letters of credit as security deposits in connection with its lease agreements. 
    
  The Company's future minimum payments under non-cancelable operating leases in excess of one year as of   September 30, 2016  , were as follows:  

Loan Purchase Obligation 
    
  Under the Company's loan account program with WebBank, a Utah-chartered industrial bank that serves as the Company's primary issuing bank, WebBank retains ownership of the loans facilitated through Lending Club's marketplace for two business days after origination. As part of this arrangement, the Company has committed to purchase the loans at par, at the conclusion of the   two   business days. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company was committed to purchase loans with an outstanding principal balance of   $55.5 million   and   $77.6 million   at par, respectively. 
    
  Loan Repurchase Obligations 
    
  The Company has historically limited its loan or note repurchase obligations to events of verified identity theft or in connection with certain customer accommodations. As institutional investors seek to securitize loans purchased through the marketplace, the Company has increased the circumstances and the required burden of proof of economic harm under which the Company is obligated to repurchase loans from these investors. We believe these repurchase obligations are customary and consistent with institutional loan and securitization market standards. 
    
  In addition to and distinct from the repurchase obligations described in the preceding paragraph, the Company performs certain administrative functions for a variety of retail and institutional investors, including executing, without discretion, loan investments as directed by the investor. To the extent loans do not meet the investor's  
  
   33

  (Unaudited) 

investment criteria at the time of issuance, or are transferred to the investor as a result of a system error by the Company, the Company is obligated to repurchase such loans at par. As a result of these obligations, we repurchased   $39.5 million   in loans during the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  Loan Funding and Purchase Commitments 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company purchased a total of   $134.9 million   in loans to fulfill regulatory requirements and to support short-term market place equilibrium as discussed below. The Company purchased   $0.4 million   in loans in the third quarter of 2016 to fulfill regulatory requirements or to support short-term market place equilibrium. 
    
  As required by applicable regulations, the Company is required to purchase loans resulting from direct marketing efforts if such loans are not otherwise invested in by investors on the platform. During the third quarter of   2016  , the Company did not purchase any such loans. Additionally, loans in the process of being facilitated and originated by the Company's issuing bank partner at   September 30, 2016  , were substantially funded in October   2016  . As of the date of this report,   no   loans remained without investor commitments and the Company was not required to purchase any of these loans.  
    
  Following the events of May 9, 2016, the Company opted to use its own capital to support short-term marketplace equilibrium and purchased   $99.5 million   in loans during the second quarter of 2016.  
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company held   $34.2 million   of loans on its balance sheet. 
    
  In addition, if neither Springstone nor the Company can arrange for other investors to invest in or purchase Pool B loans that Springstone facilitates and that are originated by an issuing bank partner, Springstone and the Company are contractually committed to purchase these loans. 
    
  The Company and the issuing bank have entered into purchase agreements with three investors to purchase Pool B loans or participation interests in Pool B loans. As of January 5, 2016, any contractual minimum purchase requirements by these three investors had expired. During the   first nine months of     2016  , the Company was not required to purchase any Pool B loans or interests in such loans. In connection with these purchase agreements, the Company has deposited   $9.0 million   into an account at the bank to secure potential, future purchases of these loans, if any. 
    
  Credit Support Agreement 
    
  The Company is subject to a credit support agreement with Cirrix Capital (Investment Fund). The credit support agreement requires the Company to pledge and restrict cash in support of its contingent obligation to reimburse the Investment Fund for net credit losses on loans underlying the Investment Fund's certificates that are in excess of a specified, aggregate net loss threshold. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $3.4 million   was pledged and restricted to support this contingent obligation. The Company's maximum exposure to loss under this credit support agreement was limited to   $6.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the net credit losses pertaining to the Investment Fund's certificates have not exceeded the specified threshold, nor are future net credit losses expected to exceed the specified threshold, and thus no liability has been recorded. The Company currently does not anticipate recording losses under this credit support agreement. If losses related to the credit support agreement are later determined to be likely to occur and are estimable, results of operations could be affected in the period in which such losses are recorded.

Legal 
    
  Securities Class Actions.   During the first nine months of 2016,   five   putative class action lawsuits alleging violations of federal securities laws were filed in California Superior Court, San Mateo County, naming as defendants the Company, current and former directors, certain officers, and the underwriters in the December 2014 initial public offering (the IPO). All of these actions were consolidated into a single action (Consolidated State Court Action), entitled   In re LendingClub Corporation Shareholder Litigation  , No. CIV537300. In August 2016, plaintiffs filed a First Amended Consolidated Complaint ("FACC") alleging violations of Sections 11, 12(a)(2) and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act) based on allegedly false and misleading statements in the IPO registration statement and prospectus. Plaintiffs seek to represent a class of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired the Company s securities pursuant and/or traceable to the IPO registration statement and prospectus, and seek unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses, including attorneys  fees, and other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. Defendants demurred to the FACC, and in September 2016, the Court overruled those demurrers with respect to the Section 11 and 15 claims, and sustained the demurrers with leave to amend as the Section 12(a)(2) claim.  The Court has not yet set a date for plaintiffs to file their Second Amended Consolidated Complaint. The Company believes that the plaintiffs  allegations are without merit, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. 
    
  In May 2016, two related putative securities class actions (entitled   Evellard v. LendingClub Corporation, et al.  , No. 16-CV-2627-WHA, and   Wertz v. LendingClub Corporation, et al.  , No. 16-CV-2670-WHA) were filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, naming as defendants the Company and certain of its officers and directors. Both actions asserted claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and one of them asserted claims under Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act similar to those alleged in the Consolidated State Court Action. In mid-August 2016, the two actions were consolidated into a single action.  Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages, costs and expenses, including attorneys  fees, and other further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. Plaintiffs  deadline to file a consolidated complaint is December 9, 2016. The Company believes that the plaintiffs  allegations are without merit, and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. 
    
  Derivative Lawsuits  . In May 2016 and August 2016, respectively, two putative shareholder derivative actions were filed in California Superior Court (  Avila v. Laplanche, et al.  , No. CIV538758 and   Dua v. Laplanche, et al.  , CGC-16-553731) against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors and naming the Company as a nominal defendant. These actions were voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by plaintiffs in October 2016.. In June 2016, another putative shareholder derivative action, entitled   Stadnicki v. Laplanche, et al.  , No. 16-CV-3072-WHA, was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against certain of the Company s current and former officers and directors and naming the Company as a nominal defendant. This action was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice by plaintiff in August 2016. 
    
  Federal Consumer Class Action.   In April 2016, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York, alleging that persons received loans, through the Company's platform, that exceeded states' usury limits in violation of state usury and consumer protection laws, and the federal RICO statute. The defendants, in addition to the Company, are WebBank, Steel Partners Holdings, L.P. and the Lending Club Members Trust. The Company has agreed to indemnify WebBank and Steel Partners Holdings, L.P. against certain liabilities in connection with this matter. The plaintiff seeks treble damages, attorneys' fees, and injunctive relief. The Company has filed a motion to compel arbitration on an individual basis, which is now pending. The Company believes that the plaintiff's allegations are without merit, and intends to defend this matter vigorously. 
    
  On February 23, 2016, Phoenix Licensing, L.L.C. and LPL Licensing, L.L.C. filed a complaint for patent infringement against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 8,234,184, 6,999,938, 5,987,434, 8,352,317, and 7,860,744 by generating

customized marketing materials, replies, and offers to client responses. The Company believes the plaintiffs allegations are without merit, and intends to defend this matter vigorously. 
    
  On May 9, 2016, following the announcement of the board review described elsewhere in this filing, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The Company was also contacted by the SEC and Federal Trade Commission ("FTC").     The Company continues cooperating with the DOJ, SEC, FTC and any other governmental or regulatory authorities or agencies. No assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of these matters. 
    
  In addition to the foregoing, the Company is subject to, and may continue to be subject to legal proceedings and regulatory actions in the ordinary course of business, including inquiries by state regulatory bodies related to the Company's marketplace lending model. These include inquiries from the California Department of Business Oversight, the New York Department of Financial Services and the West Virginia Attorney General's office. Based on the early stages of the matters above, the Company cannot provide a reasonable estimate of any potential liability arising from any such matter. 

16. Segment Reporting 
    
  The Company defines operating segments to be components of the Company for which discrete financial information is evaluated regularly by the Company s chief operating decision maker (CODM). For purposes of allocating resources and evaluating financial performance, the Company s CODM reviews financial information by the product types of personal loans, and education and patient finance loans. These product types are aggregated and viewed as   one   operating segment, and therefore,   one   reportable segment due to their similar economic characteristics, product economics, production process, and regulatory environment. 
    
  All of the Company s revenue is generated in the United States.   No   individual customer accounted for   10%   or more of consolidated net revenue for any of the periods presented. 

17. Related Party Transactions 
    
  Related party transactions must be reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee of the Company s board of directors when not conducted in the ordinary course of business subject to the standard terms of the Company s online marketplace or certificate investment program. Related party transactions may include any transaction between entities under common control or with a related person occurring since the beginning of the Company s latest fiscal year, or any currently proposed transaction involving the Company where the amount involved exceeds   $120,000  . This review also includes any material amendment or modification to an existing related party transaction. The Company has defined related persons as members of the board of directors, executive officers, principal owners of the Company s outstanding stock and any immediate family members of each such related persons, as well as any other person or entity with significant influence over the Company s management or operations. 
    
  Several of the Company's executive officers and directors (including immediate family members) have made deposits and withdrawals to their investor accounts and purchased loans, notes and certificates or have investments in private funds managed by LCA. The Company believes all such transactions by related persons were made in the ordinary course of business and were transacted on terms and conditions that were not more favorable than those obtained by similarly situated third-party investors. 
    
  At December 31, 2015, Mr. Laplanche, the Company's former CEO and Chairman, and a board member owned approximately   2.0%   and   10%  , respectively, of limited partnership interests in the Investment Fund, a holding

company that participates in a family of funds with other unrelated third parties and purchases whole loans and interests in loans from the Company.   
    
  During the   first nine months of     2016  , this family of funds purchased   $212.0 million   of whole loans and interests in whole loans. During the   first nine months of     2016  , the Company earned   $1.3 million   in servicing fees and   $51 thousand   in management fees from this family of funds, and paid interest of   $6.2 million   to the family of funds. The Company believes that the sales of whole loans and interests in whole loans, and the servicing and management fees charged were on terms and conditions that were not more favorable than those obtained by other third-party investors. 
    
  On April 1, 2016, the Company closed its   $10.0 million   investment, for an approximate ownership interest of   15%   in the Investment Fund.  At the time the Company made its investment, the Company's Related Party Investors also had limited partnership interests in the Investment Fund that resulted in an aggregate ownership of approximately   29%   in the Investment Fund. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company and a board member had an aggregate ownership interest of approximately   27%   in the Investment Fund. 

18. Subsequent Events 
    
  The Company has evaluated the impact of events that have occurred subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , through the date the condensed consolidated financial statements were filed with the SEC. Based on this evaluation, other than as recorded or disclosed within these condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, the Company has determined none of these events were required to be recognized or disclosed.

  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Report). In addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Report, particularly in      Part II   Other Information   Item 1A   Risk Factors      in this Report and      Part I   Item 1A   Risk Factors      in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (Annual Report). 

Overview 
    
  Lending Club is the world s largest online marketplace connecting borrowers and investors. We believe a technology-powered marketplace is a more efficient mechanism to allocate capital between borrowers and investors than the traditional banking system. Qualified consumers and small business owners borrow through Lending Club to lower the cost of their credit and enjoy a better experience than traditional bank lending. 
    
  Investors use Lending Club to earn attractive risk-adjusted returns from an asset class that has generally been closed to many investors and only available on a limited basis to institutional investors. The capital to invest in the loans enabled through our marketplace comes directly from a wide range of investors, including retail investors, high-net-worth individuals and family offices, banks and finance companies, insurance companies, hedge funds, foundations, pension plans and university endowments, and through a variety of investment channels. Although the Company's overall business model remains premised on the Company not using its balance sheet and assuming credit risk for loans facilitated through our marketplace, the Company may use its capital to support contractual obligations (Pool B loans and repurchase obligations), regulatory commitments (direct mail), support short-term marketplace equilibrium, customer accommodations, or other needs. The Company's use of its capital on the platform from time to time has been, and will be, on terms that are substantially similar to other investors. Additionally, the Company may use its capital to invest in loans associated with the testing or initial launch of new or alternative loan terms, programs or channels to establish a track record of performance prior to facilitating third-party investments in these loans. 
    
  We generate revenue from transaction fees from our marketplace s role in accepting and decisioning applications for our bank partners to enable loan originations, servicing fees from investors for matching available loan assets with capital, and management fees from investment funds and other managed accounts. 
    
  Generally, the transaction fees we receive from issuing banks in connection with our marketplace s role in facilitating loan originations range from   1%   to   7%   of the initial principal amount of the loan as of   September 30, 2016  . In addition, for education and patient finance loans, transaction fees may exceed   7%   as they include fees earned from issuing banks and service providers. Servicing fees paid to us vary based on investment channel. Note investors generally pay us a servicing fee equal to   1%   of payment amounts received from the borrower. Whole loan purchasers pay a monthly servicing fee of up to   1.3%   per annum on the month-end principal balance of loans serviced. Certificate holders do not pay a servicing fee, but pay a monthly management fee of up to   1.5%   per annum of the month-end balance of assets under management. 
    
  Since beginning operations in   2007  , our marketplace has facilitated approximately   $22.7 billion   in loan originations. These loans were facilitated through the following investment channels: (i) the issuance of member payment dependent notes, (ii) the sale of trust certificates, or (iii) the sale of whole loans to qualified investors. Approximately   $4.3 billion   of our loan originations since inception were invested in through member payment dependent notes,   $6.6 billion   were invested in through trust certificates and   $11.8 billion   were invested in through

  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

whole loan sales. In the   third quarter   of   2016  , our marketplace facilitated approximately   $2.0 billion   of loan originations, of which approximately   $0.3 billion   were invested in through member payment dependent notes,   $0.4 billion   were invested in through trust certificates and   $1.3 billion   were invested in through whole loan sales. 

Board Review 
    
  As previously disclosed in the Company s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, in light of the circumstances relating to $22.3 million of near-prime loan sales in private transactions with a single institutional investor, as described below, and related issues involving data integrity and contract approval monitoring and review processes, we conducted a review under the supervision of an independent sub-committee of the board of directors and with the assistance of independent outside counsel and other advisors. The review also focused on investment transactions in the Investment Fund by us and two related persons and the other matters described below. 
    
  We believe that this review and the review of the additional items discussed below, which were previously disclosed in the Company's current report on Form 8-K filed on June 28, 2016, are substantially complete, although it is possible that additional issues may arise as part of the Company s response to ongoing government requests for information. 
    
  After the end of the first quarter, we became aware that approximately $15.1 million and $7.2 million in near-prime loans were sold to a single institutional investor in March and April 2016, respectively. The loans in question failed to conform to the investor's express instructions as to a non-credit, non-pricing element. Certain personnel apparently were aware that the sale did not meet the investor's criteria. In one case, involving $3.0 million in loans, an application date was changed in a live Company database in an attempt to appear to meet the investor's requirement, and the balance of the loans were sold in direct contravention of the investor's direction. The change in application date was promptly remediated. The financial impact of the sales of these $22.3 million in near-prime loans would have been to increase reported gains on sales of loans by approximately $150,000, and to derecognize the loans from the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  In April 2016, we repurchased these loans at par. As the original transfers to the investor did not meet sale criteria for accounting purposes, the transactions in March 2016 were recorded as secured borrowings and the loans sold to the investor in March were included in loans at fair value on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2016. In April 2016, we resold these loans at par to a different investor who was aware of the reason for the original repurchase. 
    
  In connection with this review, the Company concluded that, as of June 30, 2016, the Company s internal control over financial reporting was ineffective due to a material weakness and, therefore, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were also ineffective. The Company made a similar conclusion with respect to its internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016, as disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, as disclosed in our Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015. For more information about our material weakness and these control issues and proposed remediation steps, see    Item 4 - Controls and Procedures  .  
    
  As a further part of this review, an additional independent advisor was retained. The advisor analyzed certain loan data elements from whole loans issued and sold during the second quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the $3.0 million of loans noted above, the advisor observed that 99.99% of the remaining loans display either no changes or changes explained by the normal course of business. We took various control remediation steps, including termination or resignation of senior managers in May 2016 involved in these non-compliant loan sales, and intend to take additional control and other remediation steps in the coming months.

Subsequent to this review, on May 6, 2016, the board of directors accepted the resignation of Renaud Laplanche, our Chairman and CEO. The Company initially appointed Scott Sanborn, its President, as acting CEO and John C. (Hans) Morris, a director, as Executive Chairman. On June 28, 2016, the Company announced that the board of directors appointed Scott Sanborn as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President, effective June 27, 2016, and that Hans Morris would step down from his temporary role as Executive Chairman. On that date the Company also announced that Mr. Morris had been appointed the independent Chairman of the Board. 
    
  The board s review also discovered that the investment parameters of one of the funds advised by LC Advisors ("LCA"), specifically with respect to the allocation of 60-month loans held by the fund, was out of tolerance. Although the portfolio composition of the fund was disclosed monthly to the investors of the fund, it was not disclosed to our board. The board review also noted that our former CEO and our former Chief Financial Officer (CFO) had pledged some of their Company shares to secure personal loans from a third-party financial institution, which was not disclosed to the board during subsequent deliberations, prior to the discussion referred to below. In January 2016, the reduction in the Company s share price forced them to refinance. In order to avoid selling shares, the former CEO requested temporary financing, secured by real estate, from an entity related to a director of the Company. Separately, the former CEO then offered to lend an amount to the former CFO to also permit her to refinance her loan. These temporary financing arrangements were discussed with the members of the Audit Committee. The officers obtained new financing from unrelated third parties within three weeks to pay off their temporary financing arrangements. In the opinion of the Company these lending arrangements were executed on normal market terms and, because the Company had no financial involvement in them, did not require approval under the Company s policy on related party transactions. 
    
  As disclosed in the Company s current report on Form 8-K filed on June 28, 2016, the Company identified two items that necessitated additional review. The two items identified as part of this additional review were: 
    
  The first item was a review of methodologies used to determine the net asset values and monthly return figures reported for six private investment funds (the "Funds") managed by the Company s subsidiary,  LCA. The investment assets held by the Funds are essentially loans facilitated through the Company s platform and are  level 3 assets , for which no quoted market price is available and whose fair value is therefore subjective and is determined by LCA estimates and calculations. 
    
  The Company determined that adjustments were made to the valuation of the Funds' assets that were not consistent with generally accepted accounting principles. These adjustments affected the direction and the specific returns reported in monthly statements sent to limited partners. We will reimburse limited partners who, during the life of any fund, entered or exited the funds and who were adversely impacted by these adjustments. This reimbursement is expected to cost approximately $1.0 million in total, covering the period from inception of the Funds (the earliest of which was March 2011) through May 31, 2016. At September 30, 2016, the Funds had aggregate total assets of $888.0 million. LCA is providing each Fund s respective limited partners revised return figures that exclude prior adjustments. 
    
  The Company and LCA engaged an independent valuation firm, with specific expertise in the valuation of marketplace assets, to provide valuation services to the Funds. 
    
  In addition, as discussed above, the investment parameters of one of the LCA Funds, with respect to the allocation of 60-month loans, were exceeded. The Company s review also found that this was due to non-adherence to the fund s investment strategy, including in part due to the purchase of loans in the first quarter of 2016 that were about to expire on the Lending Club platform. 
    
  The Company and LCA have made several changes to improve the governance and the operations of the Funds as a result of this additional review. In June 2016, LCA established a majority independent Governing Board (the "LCA  
  
   40 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION

  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

Board") for the Funds. The LCA Board will provide fiduciary oversight and make binding determinations for certain actions and activities of the Funds including approval of valuation policies and procedures, and review and adherence to respective investment strategies. Further, we are realigning responsibilities for accounting and financial reporting for the Funds within the Company. 
    
  In the second item, the Company identified 32 loans made in the second half of December 2009 through the Lending Club platform, totaling approximately $722,800 in originations and $25,000 in revenue, to the Company s former CEO, Renaud Laplanche, and three of his family members. All but three of these loans were repaid in full in January and February of 2010, with the remaining three loans held to maturity and paid in full. The Company s review has found that these loans were issued in order to help increase reported platform loan volume for December 2009. Based on the review, the Company is confident that there are no other situations in which Mr. Laplanche inappropriately originated loans in his or his family s name during periods after December 2009. 

Effectiveness of Scoring Models 
    
  Our ability to attract borrowers and investors to our marketplace is significantly dependent on our platform s ability to effectively evaluate a borrower s credit profile and likelihood of default. The loans facilitated through our marketplace are originated by our issuing bank partners using proprietary risk algorithms to analyze an applicant s risk profile that are based upon the issuing bank s underwriting guidelines and credit policy. Additionally, loan applications are evaluated against and must comply with the underwriting standards of the originating banks. 
  Our marketplace s credit decisioning and scoring models are evaluated on a regular basis and the additional data on loan history experience, borrower behavior, economic factors and prepayment trends that we accumulate are leveraged to continually improve the models. If the platform is unable to effectively evaluate borrowers  credit worthiness, borrowers and investors may lose confidence in our marketplace. Additionally, our ability to effectively segment borrowers into relative risk profiles impacts our ability to offer attractive interest rates for borrowers as well as our ability to offer investors attractive risk-adjusted returns, both of which directly relate to our users  confidence in our marketplace. Our marketplace s credit decisioning and scoring models assign each loan offered on our marketplace a corresponding interest rate and origination fee. Our investors  returns are a function of the assigned interest rates for each particular loan invested in less any defaults over the term of the applicable loan. We believe we have a history of effectively evaluating borrower s credit worthiness and likelihood of defaults, as evidenced by the performance of various loan vintages facilitated through our marketplace. The following charts display the historical lifetime cumulative net charge-off rates (expressed as a percent of original loan balances) through   September 30, 2016  , by booking year, for all grades and   36   or   60   month terms of standard program loans for each of the years shown.

Loan Portfolio Information and Credit Metrics 
    
  The Company classifies the loans held on its balance sheet into three major loan products: standard program personal loans, custom program personal loans and other loans. The majority of the loans facilitated on our platform and retained on the balance sheet are standard program personal loans which represent loans made to prime borrowers that are publicly available to note investors and through certificates to private investors. Custom program personal loans include all other personal loans that are not eligible for our standard program and are available only to private investors. Other loans is comprised of education and patient finance loans, small business loans, and small business lines of credit. The loans on the balance sheet are financed by notes issued by the Company, certificates issued by the Trust or invested in directly by the Company.  
    
  Fair Value and Delinquencies 
    
  The outstanding principal balance, fair value and percentage of these loans that are delinquent, by loan product are as follows:   

   (1)    Components of other loans are each less than 10% of the outstanding loan balance presented individually and in the aggregate.  
   (2)    Expressed as a percent of outstanding principal balance. 
    
  Declines in the fair value of loans from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 were primarily due to increases in the yields required by investors to purchase the Company s loans, notes and certificates, and an increase in expected credit losses.   
    
  Net Annualized Charge-Off Rates 
    
  The following tables show annualized net charge-off rates, which is an alternative measure of the credit performance of the Company s portfolio from the graphs above. The net cumulative lifetime charge-off rates show total charge-offs as a function of original principal balance, while these tables show the annualized net charge-off rates that reflect the charged-off balance of loans in a specific period as a percentage of the average outstanding balance of the loans during the periods presented.  
    
  The annualized net charge-off rates for personal loans for both standard and custom programs in total for the last completed quarters below, are as follows: 
  
   43 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

(1)    Total platform comprises all loans facilitated through the marketplace including whole loans sold and loans financed by notes and certificates. 
    
  The increase in the annualized net charge-off rate in the third quarter of 2016 is due to an increase in the average age of the loans and higher observed actual charge-offs. We generally expect charge-off rates to increase with loan age, as new loans generally have fewer credit losses than seasoned loans.  Prior to 2016, the Company s loan portfolio grew significantly as the volume of loans facilitated increased. As a result, the average age of the portfolio, and with it the average charge-off rate, stayed low during that period. In 2016, loan originations have grown at a slower rate, causing average loan age to increase thereby driving an increase in the aggregate annualized charge-off rate metric. 
    
  Additionally, we have also observed higher delinquencies and charge-offs in populations characterized by high indebtedness, an increased propensity to accumulate debt, and lower credit scores. Starting in the third quarter of 2016, this trend can now be observed across grades, although it is less notable in lower risk grades and more notable in higher risk grades, particularly grade E, F, and G. In the third quarter of 2016, we also observed higher delinquencies in 2015 and early 2016 vintages, which coincides with an increase in consumer indebtedness in the U.S.  
    
  The annualized net charge-off rates for standard program loans are higher for the retained loans compared to the total platform level for each period because of a difference in grade distribution for the two portfolios. The proportion of grade A and B loans is about 30% of the retained loan portfolio compared to about 42% for the total platform level. This difference in loan grade distribution results in higher net charge-off rates for the loans on the balance sheet, as grade A and B loans have lower expected and actual credits losses.

Product Innovation 
    
  We have made substantial investments and incur expenses to research and develop or otherwise acquire new financial products for borrowers and investors. Our revenue growth to date has been a function of, and our future success will depend in part on, successfully meeting borrower and investor demand with new and innovative loan and investment options. For investors, we have introduced automated investing, application programming interface (API), investment funds and separately managed accounts that make investing in loans easier. Failure to invest in and successfully develop and offer innovative products could adversely affect our operating results and we may not recoup the costs of new products. 
    
  Marketing Effectiveness and Strategic Relationships 
    
  We have dedicated significant resources to our marketing and brand advertising efforts and strategic relationships. Our marketing efforts are designed to build awareness of Lending Club and attract borrowers and investors to our marketplace. We use a diverse array of marketing channels and are constantly seeking to improve and optimize our experience both on- and offline to achieve efficiency and a high level of borrower and investor satisfaction. We also continue to invest in our strategic relationships to raise awareness of our platform and attract borrowers and investors to our marketplace. Our operating results and ability to sustain and grow loan volume will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to make effective investments in marketing and the effectiveness of our strategic relationships. As a result of our recent events and reduced investor confidence, it may be more difficult for us to attract additional strategic relationships. We recently made investments in compliance and programs to improve investor confidence and anticipate that we will continue such investments as we continue to build our compliance infrastructure and invest in reputational risk management. 
    
  From time to time, we may enter into strategic relationships that may impact whether certain standard program loans are made available for investing through our marketplace. For example, we have a strategic partnership relationship with a consortium of community banks for our marketplace to offer co-branded personal loans to the participating banks  customers. As part of this partnership, each community bank is provided initial access to invest in loans sought by their own customers, which may include standard program loans. The customer loans that do not meet the community bank s investment criteria are then made available for investment through the marketplace. All other loans will continue to be available on our marketplace and accessible on an equal basis and are originated by our issuing banks. 
    
  Regulatory Environment 
    
  The regulatory environment for credit and online marketplaces such as ours is complex, evolving and uncertain, creating both challenges and opportunities that could affect our financial performance. We and the loans facilitated through our marketplace are subject to extensive and complex rules and regulations, licensing and examination by various federal, state and local government authorities designed to, among other things, protect borrowers (such as truth in lending, equal credit opportunity, fair credit reporting and fair debt collection practices) and investors. Our primary issuing bank, WebBank, is subject to oversight by the FDIC and the State of Utah. The other two issuing banks are NBT Bank and Comenity Capital Bank. NBT Bank is subject to oversight by the OCC and the New York Department of Financial Services, and Comenity Capital Bank is subject to oversight by the FDIC and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. These authorities impose obligations and restrictions on our activities and the loans facilitated through our marketplace. For example, these rules limit the fees that may be assessed on the loans, require extensive disclosure to, and consents from, the borrowers and lenders, prohibit discrimination and unfair and deceptive acts or practices and may impose multiple qualification and licensing obligations on our activities. 
    
  We expect to continue to spend significant resources to comply with these and other federal and state laws and various licensing requirements. Our marketplace incorporates a number of automated features to help comply with  
  
   45 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

these laws in an efficient and cost effective manner. While new laws and regulations or changes under existing laws and regulations could make facilitating loans or investment opportunities more difficult to achieve on acceptable terms, or at all, these events could also provide new product and market opportunities. 
    
  In May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued its decision in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC that interpreted the scope of federal preemption under the National Bank Act and held that a nonbank assignee of a loan originated by a national bank was not entitled to the benefits of federal preemption of claims of usury. The Second Circuit s decision is binding on federal courts located in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont, but the decision could also be adopted by other courts. The defendant petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision and in March 2016, the Court invited the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the U.S. on the petition. The Solicitor General filed an amicus brief that stated the Second Circuit decision was incorrect, but that the case was not yet ready to be heard by the Supreme Court.  In June 2016, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. The Federal District Court is now hearing the case in regards to Midland s alternative claim regarding choice of law, which if successful, could allow Midland to prevail and the loan to be enforceable as issued.  
    
  While we believe that our program is factually distinguishable from the case, we have revised our agreement with our primary issuing bank to further distinguish the operation of the program from the court s analysis of the facts in Madden. Under the revised program structure, an additional component of the program fee arrangement was created. This additional program fee component is dependent on the amount and timing of principal and interest payments made by borrowers of the underlying loans. Under this revised program structure the majority of the bank's revenue is therefore tied to the terms and performance of the loans. The bank also maintains an ongoing contractual relationship with borrowers, who may seek additional credit through the Lending Club program in the future. 
    
  In August 2016, a federal district court in the Central District of California considered a case brought by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) against CashCall, Inc. In that case, CashCall had an arrangement with a tribal lender associated with the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe in which loans were offered to borrowers at APR s that could exceed 300 percent. The district court ruled that, under the facts presented in the case, CashCall should be deemed the  true lender  and could not charge interest rates in excess of state usury laws. A few weeks later, in September 2016 in   Bethune v. National Solutions, Inc.  , also in the federal district court in the Central District of California, the court considered a program in which a national bank had a bank partnership with a non-bank, the Student Loan Marketing Association, in which borrowers could receive loans originated by the bank through the SMLA. The court in   Bethune   rejected the argument that the SMLA was the  true lender,  holding that the face of the borrower transactions showed that the bank had originated the loans and any further analysis to look behind the face of the transaction was inappropriate. We believe that our program is factually distinguishable from the CashCall situation. 
    
  Recognizing the growth in online marketplaces such as ours, in July 2015 the U.S. Treasury Department issued a request for information (RFI) to study the various business models and products offered by online marketplace lenders, the potential for online marketplace lending to expand access to credit to historically underserved borrowers and how the financial regulatory framework should evolve to support the safe growth of the industry. We, along with many other interested groups, submitted responses to the Treasury s RFI by the September 30, 2015 deadline. 
    
  On May 10, 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department released a white paper on the online marketplace lending industry to continue the work initiated by the RFI. The white paper includes several recommendations to the federal government and private sector participants to encourage safe growth and access to credit. We cannot predict whether any legislation or proposed rulemaking will actually be introduced or how any legislation or rulemaking will impact our business and results of operations going forward. In September 2016, representatives of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the  OCC ) stated that the agency intends to complete work on a framework by which  
  
   46 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

it will consider innovative financial platforms such as marketplace lenders. In October 2016, the OCC announced the creation of a separate Office of Innovation within the OCC to assist banks and non-banks in considering innovative financial products, services and platforms. 
    
  In December 2015, the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO) sent an online survey to fourteen marketplace lenders, including us, requesting information about our business model, online platform, loan performance and investor funding process. In May 2016, the DBO requested additional information from us and other survey participants. 
    
  While we are subject to the regulatory and enforcement authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), as a facilitator, servicer or acquirer of consumer credit, the CFPB has recently announced that it intends to expand its supervisory authority, through the use of  larger participant rules,  to cover larger marketplace lenders, non-bank installment lenders and auto lenders. The CFPB has announced larger participant rules for auto lenders but has not yet announced specifics regarding its proposed rulemaking for installment loan lenders and, consequently, there continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB s strategies and priorities, including any final rules, will impact our unsecured installment loan business and our results of operations going forward. 
    
  In addition, as a result of events surrounding the resignation of our CEO, we have received inquiries from governmental entities, and we continue to cooperate fully. Responding to inquiries of this nature are costly and time consuming, can generate negative publicity, and could have a material and adverse effect on our business. 

Current Economic and Business Environment 
    
  Lending Club monitors a variety of economic, credit and competitive indicators so that borrowers can benefit from meaningful savings compared to alternatives, and investors can continue to find attractive risk-adjusted returns compared to other fixed income investments or investment alternatives.  
    
  Our marketplace has a number of levers at its disposal to adjust to changing market conditions, including the ability to quickly adapt underwriting models and dynamically increase or decrease pricing to provide an appropriate level of loss coverage to investors. Consistent with observations earlier this year, we have continued to observe higher delinquencies in populations characterized by high indebtedness, an increased propensity to accumulate debt, and lower credit scores. Starting in the third quarter of 2016 this trend can now be observed across grades, although it is less notable in lower risk grades and more notable in higher risk grades, particularly grades E, F and G.  In the third quarter of 2016, standard program personal loan grades E, F, and G accounted for approximately 8% of platform volume. Additionally, in the third quarter of 2016, we observed higher delinquencies in 2015 and early 2016 vintages, which coincides with an uptick in consumer indebtedness in the U.S. 
    
  In response to our observations of borrower performance, and taking into account a cautious economic outlook from our platform investors and ourselves, platform interest rates were raised by a weighted average of approximately 135 basis points from November 2015 to June 2016, primarily in more economically sensitive loan grades D through G. Effective October 14, 2016, the Company increased interest rates by a weighted average total of 26 basis points.  These interest rate increases were concentrated in Grades F and G with marginal changes in other grades. 
    
  In addition to the increased interest rates, the origination fee paid by borrowers was also increased in March of 2016. These combined rates and fee increases may negatively impact the volume of loans facilitated through our marketplace. 
    
  In April 2016 and again in June 2016, we eliminated underperforming populations from the platform's credit policy that was mainly characterized by high indebtedness, an increased propensity to accumulate debt and lower credit scores. Together, these actions accounted for eliminating approximately 9% of total loan volume on an annualized  
  
   47 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

basis. In line with actions taken throughout 2016, on October 12, 2016, the credit underwriting criteria was tightened to no longer approve loans for certain sub-segments of borrowers who meet a combination of several risk factors such as high revolving debt, multiple recently opened installment loans, and higher risk scores on our proprietary scorecard. As a result of this credit underwriting change, we believe that approximately 1% of borrowers who previously would have been able to obtain a loan under prior underwriting criteria will no longer be approved. 
    
  As a result of the circumstances surrounding the loan sales noted above under "Board Review", a number of investors that, in the aggregate, have contributed a significant amount of funding on the platform, paused their investments in loans through the platform as they perform audit and validation tests on their portfolios, or are otherwise reluctant to invest. The Company saw existing investors re-engage and commence investing in loans late in the second quarter of 2016 and that engagement continued into the third quarter of 2016 as total loan originations in the third quarter of 2016 were $2.0 billion. The Company's incentives provided to whole loan investors previously disclosed continued in the third quarter of 2016, however, such incentives ceased effective September 1, 2016. The Company may enter into strategic arrangements, for example, agreements that involve larger or more long-term forms of committed capital. On November 7, 2016 the Company announced a new addition to the Company s investor capital mix through an arrangement with a subsidiary of the National Bank of Canada which has approved up to $1.3 billion to be deployed on the Lending Club platform. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the first $325 million has been committed to be deployed on the platform over the next three months.   
    
  We believe it is uncertain whether the trend of returning investors will continue or what impact it may have on our business, results of operations, financial condition or our stockholders. It is possible that these investors may not all return to our platform or may not return at their previous scale. We continue to meet with current and prospective platform investors in order to increase the amount of capital committed to the platform.  
    
  Additionally, we continue to actively explore ways to increase investor engagement in our platform and obtain additional investment capital for the platform loans.  
    
  The use of the Company's balance sheet as a source of initial funding was significantly reduced in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2016. The Company purchased a total of $0.4 million in loans to fulfill regulatory requirements or to support short-term marketplace equilibrium in the third quarter of 2016, down from   $134.9 million   in the second quarter of 2016. The Company was able to find additional investors in these loans, or previously funded loans, and resold   $135.5 million   in the second quarter of 2016.  
    
  The outstanding principal balance of loans for which the Company remained invested in as of September 30, 2016 amounted to $  34.2 million  .  

Factors That Can Affect Revenue 
    
  As a marketplace, we work toward matching supply and demand while also growing originations and correspondingly revenue at a pace commensurate with proper planning, compliance risk management, user experience, and operational controls that work to optimize the quality of the customer experience, customer satisfaction and long term growth. 
    
  The interplay of the volume, timing and quality of loan applications, investment appetite, investor confidence in our data, controls and processes and available investment capital from investors, platform loan processing and originations, and the subsequent performance of loans, which directly impacts our servicing fees, can affect our revenue in any particular period. These drivers collectively result in transaction, servicing or management fees earned by us related to these transactions and their future performance. As these drivers can be affected by a variety of factors, both in and out of our control, revenues may fluctuate from period to period. Factors that can affect these drivers and ultimately revenue and its timing include:

    availability or the timing of the deployment of investment capital by investors,  
                
    the availability and amount of new capital from pooled investment vehicles and managed accounts that typically deploy their capital at the start of a period,  
                
    the amount of purchase limitations we can impose on larger investors as a way to maintain investor balance and fairness,  
                
    the attractiveness of alternative opportunities for borrowers or investors,  
                
    the responsiveness of applicants to our marketing efforts,  
                
    expenditures on marketing initiatives in a period,  
                
    the sufficiency of operational staff to process any manual portion of the loan applications in a timely manner,  
                
    the responsiveness of borrowers to satisfy additional income or employment verification requirements related to their application,  
                
    borrower withdrawal rates,  
                
    the percentage distribution of loans between the whole and fractional loan platforms,  
                
    platform system performance,  
                
    seasonality in demand for our platform and services, which is generally lower in the first and fourth quarters, 
                
    and other factors.  
       
  Given these factors, at any point in time, we have loan applications in various stages from initial application through issuance. Depending upon the timing and impact of these factors, loans may not be issued by our issuing bank in the same period in which the corresponding application was originally made resulting in a portion of that subsequent period s revenue being earned from loan applications that were initiated in the immediately prior period. Consistent with our revenue recognition accounting policy under GAAP, we do not recognize the associated transaction fee revenue with a loan until the loan is issued by our issuing banks and the proceeds are delivered to the borrower. Our receipt of a transaction fee is not impacted by who or how a loan is invested in.

  Loan Originations 
    
  We believe originations are a key indicator of the adoption rate of our marketplace, growth of our brand, scale of our business, strength of our network effect, economic competitiveness of our products and future growth. Factors that could affect loan originations include investor confidence in our platform and internal processes, the amount of our capital available to invest in loans, interest rate and economic environment; the competitiveness of our products, primarily based on our platform's rates and fees; the success of our operational efforts to balance investor and borrower demand; any limitations on the ability of our issuing banks to originate loans; our ability to develop new products or enhance existing products for borrowers and investors; the success of our sales and marketing initiatives and the success of borrower and investor acquisition and retention.

Total Net Revenue   

N/M - Not meaningful. 
    
  Our primary sources of revenue consist of fees received for transactions through or related to our marketplace and include transaction, servicing and management fees. The analysis below is presented for the following periods:  Third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 (Quarter Over Quarter), third quarter of 2016 compared to the second quarter of 2016 (Sequential), and the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 (Nine Months Over Nine Months). 
    
  Transaction Fees    
    
  Transaction fees are fees paid by issuing banks or education and patient service providers to us for the work we perform through our marketplace's role in facilitating loan originations. The amount of these fees is based upon the terms of the loan, including grade, rate, term and other factors. As of   September 30, 2016  , these fees ranged from   1%   to   7%   of the initial principal amount of a loan. In addition, for education and patient finance loans, transaction fees may exceed   7%   as they include fees earned from issuing banks and the service providers. 
    
  In March 2016, we increased the transaction fee that we earn from our primary issuing bank partner for certain prime and near-prime C through G graded loans from 5% to 6%, B graded loans from 4% to 5%, and A graded loans by approximately 1% at each subgrade level for grades A2 to A5. Depending upon the customer impact of these fee changes, these fees may be modified in order to maintain overall platform balance between borrowers and investors.  
    
  In October   2016  , we recognized approximately $3.9 million in transaction fee revenue associated with the issuance of loans in which the loan application process had commenced prior to the end of the   third quarter   of   2016  . In

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

October 2015, we recognized approximately $11.7 million in transaction fee revenue associated with the issuance of loans in which the loan application process had commenced prior to the end of the   third quarter   of   2015  . 
    
  Quarter Over Quarter  : Transaction fees were   $100.8 million   and   $100.4 million   for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. Higher average transactions fees in the   third quarter   of   2016   resulting from the March 2016 fee increases discussed above were offset by lower origination volume in the comparative quarters. The average transaction fee as a percentage of the initial principal balance of the loan was   5.1%   and   4.5%   for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively, driven by a change in the mix of loans issued and the increase in transaction fees noted above. This was offset by a 12% decrease in loan origination volume during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter of 2015. 
    
  Sequential  : Transaction fees were   $100.8 million   and   $96.6 million   for the third and second quarter of   2016  , respectively, an increase of   4%  . The increase was primarily driven by higher average transaction fees in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of a change in the mix of loan originations towards lower grades that carry higher transaction fees. The average transaction fee as a percentage of the initial principal balance of the loan was   5.1%   and 4.9% for the third and second quarter of   2016  , respectively. 
    
  Nine Months Over Nine Months  : Transaction fees were   $321.9 million   and   $258.6 million   for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively, an increase of   25%  . The increase was due to an increase in loans facilitated through our marketplace from   $5.8 billion   for the   first nine months of     2015   to approximately   $6.7 billion   for the   first nine months of     2016  , an increase of   15%  , as well as higher average transaction fees in the first nine months of 2016 resulting from the March 2016 fee increases discussed above. The average transaction fee as a percentage of the initial principal balance of the loan was   4.8%   and   4.5%   for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Servicing Fees 
    
  Servicing fees paid to us vary based on investment channel. Servicing fees compensate us for the costs we incur in servicing the related loan, including managing payments from borrowers, collections, payments to investors and maintaining investors  account portfolios. The amount of servicing revenue earned is predominantly affected by the various servicing rates paid by note and whole loan investors in the applicable investment channels, the outstanding principal balance of whole loans serviced, and the amount of principal and interest collected from borrowers and remitted to note and certain certificate investors. Additionally, servicing fee revenue includes the change in fair value of our servicing assets and liabilities associated with loans that we sell. 
    
  Servicing rights are recorded as either an asset or liability depending on the degree to which the contractual loan servicing fee is above or below, respectively, an estimated market rate loan servicing fee. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company increased its assumption of the market rate of loan servicing from 57 basis points per annum to 63 basis points per annum, based on review of estimated third party servicing rates and market servicing benchmarking analyses provided by two third party valuation firms. The increase in the assumption of a market rate of loan servicing caused the value of the Company s servicing rights to decrease.  The recording of the change in fair value of servicing rights does not affect the contractual servicing rates that the Company collects from the whole loan investors on a monthly basis.  
    
  Quarter Over Quarter  : Servicing fee revenue was $16.5 million and $9.0 million for the   third quarter  s of   2016   and 2015, respectively, an increase of 83%. The increase was primarily due to increases in both the balances of whole loans sold and the loan balances that underlie the notes and certificates. Additionally, servicing fee revenue increased due to higher contractual collection fees.  
    
  Sequential  : Servicing fee revenue increased by $4.9 million during the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the second quarter of   2016   due to increased servicing fees related to whole loans sold and notes of $1.9 million plus a

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

$3.0 million lower decrease in the fair value of servicing assets and liabilities. The fair value decrease in the second quarter of 2016 resulted from an increase in the assumption of the market rate of loan servicing. There was no such adjustment in the third quarter of 2016.  
    
  Nine Months Over Nine Months  : Servicing fee revenue was $45.1 million and $20.9 million for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively, an increase of 116%. The increase was due to increases in both the balances of whole loans sold and the loan balances that underlie the notes and certificates.  
    
  The table below illustrates the composition of servicing fees by source for each period presented:   

Management Fees    
    
  Investors in funds managed by LCA, pay a monthly management fee based on the month-end balance of their assets under management, up to   1.5%   per annum. LCA does not earn any carried interest from the investment funds. For managed account certificate holders, LCA earns a management fee of up to   1.2%   per annum of the month-end balance of their assets under management. Any of these fees may be waived or reduced at the discretion of LCA. A significant portion of the management fees is earned from the funds that are managed by LCA. We currently anticipate that the assets under management associated with these funds will decrease as a result of a significant amount of redemption requests received. This potential reduction will negatively affect management fee revenue. At September 30, 2016, the aggregate assets of these funds were $0.9 billion and outstanding aggregate redemption requests totaled $588.2 million. 
    
  Quarter Over Quarter  : Management fees were   $2.0 million   and   $2.9 million   for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively, a decrease of   32%  . The decrease in management fees was primarily due to a reimbursement of prior management fees to some investors. 
  
   56 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

Sequential  : Management fees were   $2.0 million   and $  3.1 million   for the third and second quarter of   2016  , respectively, a decrease of   36%   due to a reimbursement of management fees overages. 
    
  Nine Months Over Nine Months  : Management fees were   $8.6 million   and   $7.7 million   for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively, an increase of   12%  . The increase in management fees was primarily due to an increase in the total assets under management and outstanding certificate balances. 
    
  Other Revenue    
    
  Other revenue primarily consists of gains and losses on sales of whole loans and referral revenue. In connection with whole loan sales, in addition to the transaction and servicing fees earned with respect to the corresponding loan, we recognize a gain or loss on the sale of that loan based on the degree to which the contractual loan servicing fee is above or below an estimated market rate loan servicing fee. Referral revenue consists of fees earned from third-party companies when customers referred by us complete specified actions with such third-party companies.  
    
  The table below illustrates the composition of other revenue for each period presented: 

Quarter Over Quarter  : Other revenue (loss) was   $(6.7) million   and   $2.7 million   for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The sale of loans in the third quarter of 2016 resulted in approximately   $10.7 million   of incentives provided to investors. Prior to the second quarter of 2016 the Company had not historically provided such incentives.  
    
  Sequential  : Other revenue (loss) was   $(6.7) million   and   $(8.9) million   for the third and second quarter of   2016  , respectively.  
    
  Nine Months Over Nine Months  : Other revenue (loss) was   $(9.3) million   and   $5.1 million   for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. As noted above, incentives were provided to investors commencing in the second quarter of 2016 resulting in approximately $14.0 million and $10.7 million of incentives provided in the second and third quarters of 2016, respectively.

Net Interest Income and Fair Value Adjustments 

Except as set forth below, we generally do not assume principal or interest rate risk on loans facilitated through our marketplace because loan balances, interest rates and maturities are matched and offset by an equal balance of notes or certificates with the exact same interest rates and maturities. We only make principal and interest payments on notes and certificates to the extent that we receive borrower payments on corresponding loans. As a servicer, we are only required to deliver borrower payments to the extent that we actually receive them. As a result, on our statement of operations for any period and balance sheet as of any date, (i) interest income on loans corresponds to the interest expense on notes and certificates and (ii) loan balances correspond to note and certificate balances with variations resulting from timing differences between the crediting of principal and interest payments on loans and the disbursement of those payments to note and certificate holders. Interest income on loans the Company purchased is recorded in the condensed consolidated statement of operations without corresponding interest expense.  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company purchased a total of   $134.9 million   in loans to fulfill regulatory requirements and to support short-term marketplace equilibrium. The Company was able to find additional investors in these loans, or previously funded loans, and resold   $135.5 million   of these loans before June 30, 2016. The Company purchased $0.4 million in loans in the third quarter of 2016 to fulfill regulatory requirements or to support short-term market place equilibrium. 
    
  The outstanding principal balance of loans for which the Company remained invested in as of September 30, 2016 amounted to   $34.2 million  . The Company recorded a negative fair valuation adjustment on the loans it had remained invested in as of September 30, 2016 of approximately   $1.0 million   and   $0.5 million   during the second and third quarter of 2016, respectively. See    Part I   Financial Information   Item 1   Financial Statements   Note 12   Secured Borrowings    for additional information.

Additionally, interest income includes interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and the securities available for sale portfolio. Our investment policy and strategy is focused first on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements, and then maximizing returns. The following table provides additional detail related to net interest income and fair value adjustments: 

N/M - Not meaningful. 
    
  Interest income from loans was   $170.6 million   and   $144.7 million   for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to the increase in the outstanding balances of loans. Interest income from loans was   $525.7 million   and   $387.7 million   for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to the increase in the outstanding balances of loans.

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION

  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

Interest expense for notes and certificates was   $169.4 million   and   $144.7 million   for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the increase in the outstanding balances of notes and certificates. Interest expense for notes and certificates was   $523.7 million   and   $387.7 million   for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to the increase in the outstanding balances of notes and certificates. 
    
  Fair Value Adjustments on Loans, Notes and Certificates:   The changes in fair value of loans, notes and certificates are shown on our condensed consolidated statement of operations on a net basis. Due to the payment dependent feature of the notes and certificates, fair value adjustments on loans that are invested in by third-parties through the marketplace are offset by the fair value adjustments on the notes and certificates, resulting in no net effect on our earnings. Fair value adjustments on loans the Company purchases have an effect on earnings. In the first quarters of 2016 and 2015, fair value adjustments on such loans were immaterial. We estimate the fair value of loans and their related notes and certificates using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology that is described in    Part II   Item 8   Financial Statements and Supplementary Data   Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    in the Annual Report. 
    
  The net fair value adjustments were immaterial for the   third quarters of   and   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  . The losses from fair value adjustments on loans were largely offset by the gains from fair value adjustments on notes and certificates due to the borrower payment dependent design of the notes and certificates and due to the principal balances of the loans being similar to the combined principal balances of the notes and certificates. 

Operating Expenses 
    
  Our operating expenses consist of sales and marketing, origination and servicing, engineering and product development and other general and administrative expenses as described below. 
    
  Sales and Marketing:   Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of borrower and investor acquisition efforts including costs attributable to marketing and selling our products. This includes costs of building general brand awareness, and salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense related to our sales and marketing team. 
    
  Origination and Servicing:   Origination and servicing expense consists of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense and vendor costs attributable to activities that most directly relate to originating and servicing loans for borrowers and investors. These costs relate to the credit, collections, customer support and payment processing teams and related vendors. 
    
  Engineering and Product Development:   Engineering and product development expense consists primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for engineering and product management teams, and the cost of contractors who work on the development and maintenance of our platform. Engineering and product development expense also includes non-capitalized hardware and software costs and depreciation and amortization of technology assets. 
    
  Other General and Administrative:   Other general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense for our accounting, finance, legal, human resources and facilities teams, and professional services fees. Other general and administrative expense also includes facilities and compensation expenses related to the acquisition of Springstone. 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we disaggregated the expense previously reported as  General and administrative  into  Engineering and product development  and  Other general and administrative  expense. Additionally, we reclassified certain operating expenses between  Sales and marketing,   Origination and servicing,   Engineering and product development  and  Other general and administrative  expense to align such classifications and

presentations with how we currently manage the operations and these expenses. These changes had no impact to  Total operating expenses.  Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation.  
    
  In light of the significant decrease in the trading price of our common stock in May 2016, we began offering incentive retention awards to certain members of the executive management team and other key personnel that totaled $34.9 million that will be recognized as compensation expense ratably through May 2017. In addition, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant legal and other expenses in connection with the inquiries and private litigation that has risen and may continue to arise from the internal review of the sub-committee of the board of directors discussed above.

            (1)     
    Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
       
  Sales and marketing expense was   $44.9 million   and   $44.0 million   for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively, an increase of   2%  .  The increase was primarily due to a   $1.1 million   increase in variable marketing expenses.  On a sequential basis, sales and marketing expense was   $44.9 million   and   $49.7 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the second quarter of   2016  , respectively, a decrease of   10%  . The decrease was primarily due to a   $3.1 million   decrease in non-recurring advisory fee and a   $1.2 million   decrease in personnel-related expenses associated with lower headcount levels, and severance costs. 
    
  Origination and servicing expense was   $16.3 million   and   $16.7 million   for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively, a decrease of   2%  . The decrease was primarily due to a   $0.5 million   decrease in loan processing costs, partially offset by a   $0.3 million   increase in personnel-related expenses associated with higher headcount levels. On a sequential basis, origination and servicing expense was   $16.3 million   and   $20.9 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the second quarter of   2016  , respectively, a decrease of   22%  . The decrease was primarily due to a   $2.3 million   decrease in personnel-related expenses associated with lower headcount levels and severance costs. 
    
  Engineering and product development expense was   $29.4 million   and   $21.1 million   for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively, an increase of   40%  . The increase was primarily driven by investment in our platform and product development, which included a   $5.3 million   increase in personnel-related expenses resulting from increased headcount and increased salaries, and a   $2.4 million   increase in equipment, software and depreciation expense.  On a sequential basis, engineering and product development expense was   $29.4 million   and   $29.2 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the second quarter of   2016  , respectively, an increase of   1%  . The increase was primarily driven by investment in our platform and product development, which included a   $0.9 million   increase in personnel-related expenses resulting from retention costs, offset by a   $0.7 million   decrease in equipment, software and depreciation expense.  
    
  We capitalized   $9.8 million   and   $7.5 million   in software development costs in the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Other general and administrative expense was   $58.9 million   and   $32.3 million   for the   third quarters of     2016   and   2015  , respectively, an increase of   83%  . The increase was primarily due to a   $13.8 million   increase in legal, audit, communications, and advisory fees associated with the board review and government inquiries discussed above, including investigating the matters identified in the board review, supporting investor due diligence activities, remediation efforts and pending and potential future litigation matters. The increase was also due to a   $7.2 million   increase in salaries and stock-based compensation expense related to increased headcount, and salaries of newly hired executives, as we invested in infrastructure and support teams, a $2.8 million operational loss related to certain service providers of our patient and educational finance business, and a   $2.1 million   increase in facilities expense.   
    
  On a sequential basis, other general and administrative expense was   $58.9 million   and   $53.5 million   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the second quarter of   2016  , respectively, an increase of   10%  . The increase was primarily due to a   $2.9 million   increase in stock-based compensation expense primarily driven by retention costs, and a $2.8 million operational loss related to certain service providers of our patient and educational finance business.  The increase was also due to a   $0.3 million   increase in legal, audit, communications, and advisory fees associated with the board review discussed above, including investigating the matters identified in the board review, supporting investor due diligence activities, remediation efforts and litigation matters that have arisen, and may continue to arise.

The increase was primarily due to   $34.9 million   increase in variable marketing that drove higher loan originations, a   $4.3 million   increase in personnel-related expense associated with higher headcount levels, retention costs, severance costs, and a   $2.8 million   increase in non-recurring advisory fees.

We capitalized   $29.9 million   and   $18.1 million   in software development costs in the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Other general and administrative expense was   $150.4 million   and   $86.9 million   for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively, an increase of   73%  . The increase was primarily due to a   $29.1 million   increase in legal, audit, communications, and advisory fees associated with the board review discussed above, including investigating the matters identified in the board review, supporting investor due diligence activities, remediation efforts and litigation matters that have arisen, and may continue to arise. The increase is also due to a   $21.4 million   increase in salaries and stock-based compensation expense related to increased headcount as we invested in infrastructure and support teams, retention costs, severance costs, as well as a   $6.8 million   increase in facilities expense. 
    
  Goodwill Impairment 
    
  Goodwill impairment consists of a charge for the excess of the fair value of goodwill over the carrying value of the education and patient finance reporting unit. 
    
  In the second quarter of 2016 and in the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of   $35.4 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, related to the education and patient finance reporting unit, for a total charge of $37.1 million for the first nine months of 2016. There were no goodwill charges in the first quarter of 2016 or the first nine months of 2015. See   Note 9 Intangible Assets and Goodwill   for a further description of this impairment. If the performance of the education and patient finance reporting unit fails to meet current expectations, it is possible that the carrying value of this reporting unit, even after the current impairment charge, will exceed its fair value, which could result in further recognition of a noncash impairment of goodwill that could be material. 

Income Taxes 
    
  For the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2016   we recorded income tax benefit of   $0.2 million   and   $4.0 million  , respectively. For the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2015  , we recorded income tax expense of   $1.2 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively. The income tax benefit in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 included the recognition of a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and the tax effects of unrealized gains credited to other comprehensive income. In addition, the income tax benefit in the first nine months of 2016 included the tax effects of the impairment of tax deductible goodwill, which occurred during the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  We continued to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , the valuation allowance was   $35.4 million  . We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  We use certain non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating our operating results. We believe that contribution, contribution margin, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin help identify trends in our core business results and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by our management in its decision making. 
    
  Our non-GAAP measures of contribution, contribution margin, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted EBITDA margin have limitations as analytical tools and you should not consider them in isolation. These non-GAAP measures should not be viewed as substitutes for, or superior to, net income (loss) as prepared in accordance with GAAP. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you should be aware that in the future we will incur expenses similar to the  
  
   63 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION

  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

adjustments in this presentation. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures versus their nearest GAAP equivalents which include the following: 

Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate these measures differently, which may reduce their usefulness as a comparative measure. 
                
    These measures do not consider the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation. 
                
    Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements. 
                
    Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin do not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us. 
       
  Contribution and Contribution Margin 
    
  Contribution is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as operating revenue less  sales and marketing  and  origination and servicing  expenses on the Company s Statement of Operations, adjusted to exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense within these captions. These costs represent the costs that are most directly related to generating such operating revenue. Contribution Margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by dividing Contribution by total operating revenue. 
    
  Contribution and Contribution Margin are measures of overall direct product profitability that our management and board of directors find useful, and believe investors may find useful, in understanding the relationship between costs most directly associated with revenue generating activities and the related revenue, and remaining amount available to support our costs of engineering and product development and other general and administrative expense to evaluate our operating performance and trends. While we believe Contribution and Contribution Margin are useful for the reasons above, they should not be used as an overall measure of our profitability, as they exclude engineering and product development and other general and administrative expenses which are required to run our business. Factors that affect our Contribution and Contribution Margin include revenue mix, variable marketing expenses and origination and servicing expenses. 
    
  The following table shows the calculation of contribution and contribution margin.

    Contribution also excludes stock-based compensation expense included in the sales and marketing and origination and servicing expense categories. 
       
  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that includes operating revenue less certain non-recurring expenses including interest, and certain non-cash expenses including amortization and depreciation, and stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure calculated by dividing adjusted EBITDA by total operating revenue. 
    
  The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA is an important measure of operating performance because it allows management, investors and our board to evaluate and compare our core operating results, including our return on capital and operating efficiencies, from period to period by removing the impact of asset base (depreciation and amortization), other non-operating, and share-based compensation, tax consequences, and our capital structure (interest expense from any outstanding debt). Additionally the Company utilizes Adjusted EBITDA as an operating performance measure as an input into the Company s calculation of the annual bonus plan. In addition to its use by management, Adjusted EBITDA is a measure widely used by securities analysts, investors and others to evaluate the financial performance of our company and other companies in our industry as well as in the broader financial services and technology industries.

Servicing Fees Before Changes in Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities 
    
  Servicing and management fee revenue associated with the servicing portfolio, excluding fair market value accounting adjustments, is a non-GAAP financial measure that is calculated as servicing fees less the fair market value accounting adjustment.  The Company has elected to account for servicing assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through earnings in the period of change. The Company believes this is a useful non-GAAP financial measure because it reflects the amount of fees actually collected and represents the true economic benefit of our servicing arrangements. We believe that the fair value adjustments to the servicing assets and liabilities is less useful in particular because the Company does not trade or transfer such servicing assets or liabilities. 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of servicing fees to servicing fees before change in fair value of servicing assets and liabilities. 

Investments by Investment Channel and Investor Concentration 
    
  The following table shows the percentage of loan originations funded by investment channel for the periods presented. 

The following table provides the percentage of loans invested in by the ten largest investors during each of the previous five quarters (by dollars invested): 

For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , no single investor accounted for more than   26%   of the loans invested in through our marketplace. The composition of the top ten investors may vary from period to period. In addition to

these investors, private funds associated with LCA and publicly issued member payment dependent notes accounted for approximately   2%   and   15%  , respectively, of investment capital provided through our marketplace during the period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity 
    
  The following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the periods presented: 

(1)   
    Cash flow used for loan investing activities includes the purchase of loans and repayment of loans facilitated through our marketplace. Cash flow provided by note/certificate and secured borrowings financing activities includes the issuance of notes and certificates to investors and the repayment of those notes and certificates. These amounts generally correspond and offset each other. 
       
  Our short-term liquidity needs generally relate to our working capital requirements. These liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated from the operations of facilitating loan originations. If the recent pause in investor funding on our platform, as described above, continues, cash generated from facilitating loan originations could decline, in which case we may need to use our cash and cash equivalents on hand, which was   $520.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , to meet our working capital needs. The Company additionally had   $278.9 million   of available for sale securities at   September 30, 2016  . As shown in the table above, the Company had negative operating cash flow for the first nine months of 2016. The net loss during the first nine months of 2016, including cash expenses for legal, audit, communications, and advisory fees associated with the board review and government inquiries discussed above, including investigating the matters identified in the board review, supporting investor due diligence activities, remediation efforts and pending and potential future litigation matters, along with the purchases of loans the Company intends to sell, contributed to the negative operating cash flow for the nine months of 2016. Generally, there has been no material impact on our liquidity position as of September 30, 2016, related to the purchase of loans in the first nine months of 2016; as such, loans generally were funded by proceeds from the issuance of corresponding notes and certificates, or such loans have been sold on the same day to whole loan investors. 
    
  As a result of recent events arising out of our board review noted above, we are actively exploring ways to restore investor confidence in our platform and obtain investment capital for the platform. See    Item 2   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Current Economic and Business Environment.    
    
  Additionally, given the payment dependent structure of the notes and certificates, principal and interest payments on notes and certificates are paid only when received from borrowers on the corresponding retained loans, resulting in no material impact to our liquidity. During the second quarter of 2016, the Company purchased a total of   $134.9 million   in loans to fulfill regulatory requirements and to support short-term marketplace equilibrium. The Company was able to find additional investors in these loans, or previously funded loans, and resold   $135.5 million    
  
   69 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

of these loans before June 30, 2016. The Company purchased $0.4 million in loans in the third quarter of 2016 to fulfill regulatory requirements or to support short-term market place equilibrium. The outstanding principal balance of loans for which the Company remained invested in as of September 30, 2016 amounted to   $34.2 million  . See    Item 4   Controls and Procedures.    
    
  Cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in institutional money market funds and interest-bearing deposit accounts at investment grade financial institutions. Cash and cash equivalents were   $520.8 million   and   $623.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Changes in the balance of cash and cash equivalents during the   first nine months of     2016   were primarily a result of timing related to working capital requirements or investments in or out of our securities available for sale portfolio and changes in restricted cash and other investments. 
    
  Restricted cash consists primarily of checking, money market and certificate of deposit accounts that are: (i) pledged to or held in escrow by the Company s correspondent banks as security for transactions processed on or related to our platform or activities by certain investors; (ii) pledged through a credit support agreement with a certificate holder; (iii) held in a Rabbi Trust through a grantor trust agreement to satisfy obligations to partnerships under the Company's 2016 Cash Retention Bonus Plan, or (iv) received from investors but not yet been applied to their accounts on the platform and transferred to segregated bank accounts that hold investors  funds. Restricted cash was   $139.5 million   and   $80.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The increase is primarily attributable to additional transactions related to our platform or with certain investors. 
    
  In April 2015, we invested in securities classified as available for sale. The fair value of securities available for sale as of   September 30, 2016   was   $278.9 million  . At   September 30, 2016  , these securities include corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities and other securities. All securities were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody s rating of  Baa3  or higher, or a Standard   Poor s rating of  BBB-  or higher) and there were no significant unrealized losses. These securities provided   $2.7 million   of interest income for the   first nine months of     2016  . These securities continue to be available to meet liquidity needs. 
    
  Our available liquidity resources may also be provided by external sources. On   December 17, 2015  , we entered into a credit and guaranty agreement with several lenders for an aggregate   $120 million   secured revolving credit facility (Credit Facility). In connection with the credit agreement, we entered into a pledge and security agreement with Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., as collateral agent. Proceeds of loans made under the Credit Facility may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed until   December 17, 2020  . Repayment of any outstanding proceeds are payable on   December 17, 2020  , but may be prepaid without penalty. We did not have any loans outstanding under the Credit Facility during the   first nine months of     2016  . 
    
  On   February 9, 2016  , our board of directors approved a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase up to   $150 million   of our common shares   in open market or privately negotiated transactions in compliance with Securities and Exchange Act Rule 10b-18  .   This repurchase program is valid for one year and does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and may be suspended at any time at Lending Club s discretion. During the   nine months ended September 30,   2016  , we repurchased   2,282,720   shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of   $19.5 million  . See    Part I   Financial Information   Item 1   Financial Statements   Note 13   Employee Incentive and Retirement Plans    for additional information. 
    
  Historically, our overall business model has not been premised on using our balance sheet and assuming credit risk for loans facilitated by our marketplace. In order to support contractual obligations (Pool B loans and repurchase obligations), regulatory commitments (direct mail), short-term marketplace equilibrium, customer accommodations or other needs, we may use our capital on the platform from time to time on terms that are substantially similar to other investors. Additionally, we may use our capital to invest in loans associated with the testing or initial launch of  
  
   70 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

new or alternative loan terms, programs or channels to establish a track record of performance prior to facilitating third-party investments in these loans. 
    
  With the announcement of the initial results of the internal board review on May 9, 2016 and additional findings disclosed on June 28, 2016, many investors paused or reduced their investment activity. The Company has been focused on working with these investors to resume their investment activity and on bringing new investors to the platform. During the second quarter of 2016 and the third quarter of 2016 through August 31,2016 the Company offered incentives to investors in exchange for investment activity. The Company did not offer incentives to investors for investments in loans in the month of September 2016. Although the Company did not have to use a material amount of its own capital to purchase loans in the third quarter of 2016, the failure of the Company to attract investor capital may result in the Company using a greater amount of its own capital to purchase loans on the platform compared to prior periods, or reduce origination volume. These actions may have material adverse impacts on the Company's business, financial condition (including its liquidity), results of operations or ability to sustain and grow loan volume. For a description of recent developments and their potential impact to our liquidity and capital resources, see    Current Economic and Business Environment    above. 
    
  We believe based on our projections and ability to reduce loan volume if needed, that our cash on hand, funds available from our line of credit, and our cash flow from operations is expected to be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months. 
    
  Capital Resources 
    
  Capital expenditures were   $39.0 million  , or   10.5%   of total net revenue, and   $25.9 million  , or   9.0%   of total net revenue, for the   first nine months of     2016   and   2015  , respectively. Capital expenditures in 2016 are expected to be approximately   $59.0 million  , primarily related to continued investment in infrastructure and technology. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   $4.7 million   in standby letters of credit were outstanding related to certain financial covenants required for our leased facilities. To date, no amounts have been drawn against the letters of credit, which renew annually and expire at various dates through July 2026. There were no off-balance sheet arrangements during the   first nine months of     2015  . 

Contingencies 
    
  The Company's contingencies as of   September 30, 2016   are included in        Part I   Financial Information   Item 1   Financial Statements   Note 15   Commitments and Contingencies.    

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  Certain of the Company's accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are discussed in    Part II   Item 7   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation   Critical Accounting Estimates    in the Annual Report. There have been no significant changes to these critical accounting estimates during the   first nine months of   of   2016  , except as noted below. 
    
  Goodwill and Intangible Assets 
    
  Goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of the aggregate fair value of the identified net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever indications of impairment exist. Our annual impairment testing date is April 1. Impairment exists whenever the carrying value of  
  
   71 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Adverse changes in impairment indicators such as loss of key personnel, increase regulatory oversight, or unplanned changes in our operations could result in impairment. We recognized $  1.7 million   and   37.1 million   of goodwill impairment expense during the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2016  , respectively. We did not recognize any goodwill impairment during the   third quarter   and   first nine months of     2015  , respectively. 
    
  We can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit (generally defined as a component of a business for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) exceeds its carrying value. A qualitative assessment may consider macroeconomic and other industry-specific factors, such as trends in short-term and long-term interest rates and the ability to access capital, or company-specific factors, such as market capitalization in excess of net assets, trends in revenue generating activities and merger or acquisition activity. 
    
  If we do not qualitatively assess goodwill we compare a reporting unit s estimated fair value to its carrying value. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using both an income approach and a market approach. When applying the income approach, we use a discounted cash flow model, which requires the estimation of cash flows and an appropriate discount rate. We project cash flows expected to be generated by the reporting unit inclusive of an estimated terminal value. The discount rate assumption contemplates a weighted-average cost of capital based on both market observable and company-specific factors. The discount rate is risk-adjusted to include any premiums related to equity price volatility, size, and projected capital structure of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business. The market approach estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on certain market value multiples of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business, such as total enterprise value to revenue, or to EBITDA. Under the market approach, we also consider fair value implied from any relevant and comparable market transactions. Both approaches include reliance on long-term growth rates, and revenue and earnings projections. 
    
  We recorded a goodwill impairment during the second and third quarter of 2016 after completing the annual impairment test. See    Part I   Financial Information   Item 1   Financial Statements   Note 9  Intangible Assets and Goodwill    for additional information. 
    
  Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives in a manner that best reflects their economic benefit, which may include straight-line or accelerated methods of amortization. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment quarterly and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. We do not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets. 
    
  Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities 
    
  A variable interest entity (VIE) is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its own operations, whose equity holders do not have the power to direct the activities most significantly affecting the economic outcome of those activities, or whose equity holders do not share proportionately in the losses or receive the residual returns of the entity. The determination of whether an entity is a VIE requires a significant amount of judgment. When we have a controlling financial interest in a VIE, it must consolidate the results of the VIE s operations into its condensed consolidated financial statements. A controlling financial interest exists if we have both the power to direct the VIE s activities that most significantly affect the VIE s economic performance (power) and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits that could be potentially significant to the VIE (economics). 
    
  LC Trust I 
    
  We have determined that LC Trust I (the Trust) is a VIE and that we have a controlling financial interest in the Trust and therefore we must consolidate the Trust in its condensed consolidated financial statements. We established the Trust in February 2011 and funded it with a nominal residual investment. We are the only residual investor in the

  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

Trust. The purpose of the Trust is to acquire and hold loans for the benefit of investors who have invested in certificates issued by the Trust. The Trust conducts no other business other than purchasing and retaining loans or portions thereof for the benefit of the investment funds and their underlying limited partners. The Trust holds loans, none of which are financed by us. The cash flows from the loans held by the Trust are used to repay obligations under the certificates. The Trust s assets and liabilities were reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In connection with the formation of the investment funds, it was determined that in order to achieve success in raising investment capital, the assets to be invested in by the investment funds must be held by an entity that was separate and distinct from us (i.e. bankruptcy remote) in order to reduce this risk and uncertainty. In the event of our insolvency, it is anticipated that the assets of the Trust would not become part of the bankruptcy estate, but that outcome is uncertain. 
    
  Our capital contributions, which are the only equity investments in the Trust, are insufficient to allow the Trust to finance the purchase of a significant amount of loans without the issuance of certificates to investors. Therefore, the Trust s capitalization level qualifies the Trust as a VIE. We have a financial interest in the Trust because of our right to returns related to servicing fee revenue from the Trust, our right to reimbursement for expenses, and our obligation to repurchase loans from the Trust in certain instances. Additionally, we perform or direct activities that significantly affect the Trust s economic performance through or by (i) operation of the platform that enables borrowers to apply for loans purchased by the Trust; (ii) credit underwriting and servicing of loans purchased by the Trust; (iii) LCA's selection of the loans that are purchased by the Trust on behalf of advised Certificate holders; and (iv) LCA s role to source investors that ultimately purchase limited partnership interests in a fund or Certificates, both of which supply the funds for the Trust to purchase loans. Collectively, the activities described above allow us to fund more loans than would be the case without the existence of the Trust, to collect the related loan transaction fees and for LCA to collect the management fees on the investors  capital used to purchase certificates. Accordingly, we are deemed to have power to direct activities most significant to the Trust and economic interest in the activities because of loan funding and transaction and management fees. Therefore, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of the Trust and consolidated the Trust s operations in our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Investment In Cirrix Capital 
    
  On April 1, 2016, we closed our   $10.0 million   investment, for an approximate ownership interest of   15%   in Cirrix Capital (Investment Fund), a holding company to a family of funds that purchases loans and interests in loans from us. Per the partnership agreement, the family of funds can invest up to   20%   of their assets outside of whole loans and interests in whole loans facilitated by us. At September 30, 2016,   100%   of the family of funds' assets were comprised of whole loans and interests in loans facilitated by Lending Club's platform. At the time we made our investment, our then Chief Executive Officer (former CEO) and a board member (together, the Related Party Investors) also had limited partnership interests in the Investment Fund that resulted in an aggregate ownership of approximately   29%   in the Investment Fund by the Related Party Investors and us. As of September 30, 2016, we and a board member had an aggregate ownership interest of approximately   27%   in the Investment Fund. 
    
  Our investment is deemed to be a variable interest in the Investment Fund because the limited partnership interest shares in the expected returns and losses of the Investment Fund. The expected returns and losses of the Investment Fund result from the net returns of the family of funds owned by the Investment Fund, which are derived from interest income earned from loans and interests in whole loans that are purchased by the Investment Fund. Such loans and interests in loans were facilitated by us. Additionally, the Investment Fund is considered a VIE. We are not the primary beneficiary of the Investment Fund because we do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the Investment Fund s economic performance. As a result, we do not consolidate the operations of the Investment Fund in our financial statements. We account for this investment under the equity method of accounting, which approximates its maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement in the  
  
   73 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  (Tabular Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data and Ratios, or as Noted) 

Investment Fund. At September 30, 2016, our investment was   $10.1 million  , which was recorded in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  Separately, we are subject to a credit support agreement that requires us to pledge and restrict cash in support of our contingent obligation to reimburse the Investment Fund for net credit losses on loans underlying the interests in whole loans that are in excess of a specified, aggregate net loss threshold. The Related Party Investors and us are excluded from receiving any benefits, if provided, from this credit support agreement. As of September 30, 2016, we have not been required to nor do we anticipate recording losses under this agreement. In conjunction with our determination that we have a variable interest in a VIE, the Investment Fund, we are required to disclose our maximum exposure to loss under this credit support agreement, which was limited to   $6.0 million   and   $34.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Investment Fund passes along credit risk to the limited partners. We did not design the Investment Fund s investment strategy and cannot require the Investment Fund to purchase loans. Additionally, we reviewed whether we collectively, with the board member's investment, had power to control the Investment Fund and concluded that we did not based on the unilateral ability of the general partner to exercise power over the limited partnership and the inability of the limited partners to remove the general partner. See    Note 17   Related Party Transactions    for additional information. 
    
  LCA Managed or Advised Private Funds 
    
  In conjunction with the adoption of a new accounting standard that amends accounting for consolidations effective January 1, 2016, we reviewed our relationship with the private funds managed or advised by LCA and concluded that we do not have a variable interest in the private funds. As of September 30, 2016, we do not hold any investments in the private funds. Certain of our related parties have investments in the private funds, as discussed in    Part I   Financial Information   Item 1   Financial Statements   Note 17  Related Party Transactions.    We charge the limited partners in the private funds a management fee based on their account balance at month end for services performed as the general manager, including fund administration, and audit, accounting and tax preparation services. Accordingly, our fee arrangements contain only terms, conditions, or amounts that are customarily present in arrangements for similar services negotiated at arm s length. These fees are solely compensation for services provided and are commensurate with the level of effort required to provide those services. We do not have any other interests in the private funds and therefore we do not have a variable interest in the private funds. 
    
  Management regularly reviews and reconsiders its previous conclusion regarding whether it holds variable interest in potential VIEs, the status of an entity as a VIE, and whether we are required to consolidate such VIEs in the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  There have been no other significant changes to these critical accounting policies and estimates during the   first nine months of     2016  . 
    
  Loan Servicing Rights 
    
  As a result of the nature of servicing rights on the sale of loans, the we are a variable interest holder in certain entities that purchase these loans. For all of these entities we either do not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE's economic performance or we do not have a potentially significant economic interest in the VIE. In no case are we the primary beneficiary and as a result none of these entities are consolidated on our consolidated financial statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices or interest rates. 
    
  Except for the loans invested in by the Company, we generally do not assume principal or interest rate risk on loans funded through our marketplace because loan balances, interest rates and maturities of loans are matched and offset by an equal balance of notes and certificates with the exact same interest rates and maturities. Accordingly, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the net fair value of these combined loan, note and certificate portfolios as a result of changes in interest rates. For loans that are invested in by the Company, the Company has exposure to interest rate risk.  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company purchased a total of   $134.9 million   of loans to fulfill regulatory requirements and to support short-term marketplace equilibrium. The Company was able to find additional investors in these loans, or previously funded loans, and resold   $135.5 million   of these loans before June 30, 2016. The Company purchased $0.4 million in loans in the third quarter of 2016 to fulfill regulatory requirements or to support short-term market place equilibrium. The outstanding principal balance of loans for which the Company remained invested in as of September 30, 2016 was   $34.2 million  . See    Part I   Financial Information   Item 1   Financial Statements   Note 12   Secured Borrowings    for additional information. We do not believe the interest rate risk associated with these loans held as of September 30, 2016 is material. We will experience increased exposure to interest rate risk if we increase the amount of our capital used to invest in loans given the pausing of investment by platform investors based upon the outcome of the review described above. See    Part I   Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Current Economic and Business Environment    and    Item 2   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Liquidity and Capital Resources   Liquidity.    We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes. 
    
  The fair values of loans and the related notes and certificates are determined using a discounted cash flow methodology. The fair value adjustments for loans are largely offset by the fair value adjustments of the notes and certificates due to the borrower payment dependent design of the notes and certificates and due to the total principal balances of the loans being very close to the combined principal balances of the notes and certificates. The Company recorded a negative fair value adjustment related to the loans the Company invested in as of September 30, 2016 of approximately   1.0 million   and   $0.5 million   during the second and third quarter of 2016, respectively. 
    
  We had cash and cash equivalents of   $520.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . These amounts were held primarily in interest-bearing deposits at investment grade financial institutions and institutional money market funds, which are short-term. Cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. Due to their short-term nature, we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of these liquid investments as a result of changes in interest rates. Decreases in short-term interest rates will not materially reduce interest income on these cash and cash equivalents because of the current low rate environment. Increases in short-term interest rates will modestly increase the interest income earned on these cash balances. 
    
  Interest Rate Sensitivity 
    
  The Company holds securities available for sale. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of our securities available for sale portfolio was   $278.9 million  , consisting of corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities, U.S. agency securities, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury securities and other securities. To mitigate the risk of loss, our investment policy and strategy is focused first on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements, and then maximizing returns. To manage this risk, the Company limits and monitors  
  
   75 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 

maturities, credit ratings, and concentrations within the investment portfolio. Changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on our securities available for sale and the market value of those securities. A hypothetical   100   basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately   $1.5 million   in the fair value of our securities available for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an increase of approximately   $1.5 million   in the fair value of our securities available for sale as of   September 30, 2016  . Any realized gains or losses resulting from such interest rate changes would only be recorded if we sold the securities prior to maturity and the securities were not considered other-than-temporarily impaired. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The management of the Company, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of   September 30, 2016  . This evaluation is performed to determine if our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company s CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable assurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. 
    
  As previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2016, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, as described further in    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    below. As a result of the circumstances giving rise to the material weakness described below, the Company's CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a level that provides reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures were met as of September 30, 2016. 
    
  The identified material weakness is the result of the aggregation of control deficiencies related to the Company s  tone at the top,  which manifested in three primary areas described further below. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, and in connection with a board review, with the assistance of independent outside counsel and other advisors, regarding specific near-prime loan sales and other compliance matters described elsewhere herein, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. As a result, the Company has concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company's internal control over financial reporting was ineffective. See    Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Board Review  .  In addition, the Company concluded that the deficiencies aggregating to this material weakness existed at the end of 2015 and therefore that its internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of December 31, 2015 and amended its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 accordingly. The Company made a similar conclusion with respect to its internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, as disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. 
    
  The material weakness relates to the aggregation of control deficiencies in the Company's "tone at the top" and manifested in three primary areas described further below. The control environment, which includes the Company s Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy, is the responsibility of senior management, and sets the tone of our organization, influences the control consciousness of employees, and is the foundation for the other components of internal control over financial reporting. Although each area described below involved its own deficiencies, a  
  
   76 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 

significant contributing factor to all of the deficiencies aggregating to a material weakness was the Company s lack of an appropriate tone at the top set by certain former members of senior management. The Company took immediate and significant steps to address this material weakness through the resignation or termination of certain senior managers and the resignation of the Company s former CEO. The Company initially appointed Scott Sanborn as acting CEO and Hans Morris as Executive Chairman. On June 28, 2016, the Company announced that the Board appointed Scott Sanborn as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and President, effective June 27, 2016, and that Hans Morris would step down from his temporary role as Executive Chairman. On that date the Company also announced that Mr. Morris had been appointed the independent Chairman of the Board. The Company believes that making these changes was a critical step toward addressing the tone at the top concerns that contributed to the material weakness it has identified. On August 2, 2016 the Company accepted the resignation of the CFO and appointed Bradley Coleman as principal accounting officer and interim CFO. On September 19, 2016, the Company hired Thomas W. Casey as CFO. Bradley Coleman will continue in his role as Principal Accounting Officer and Corporate Controller. 
    
  In particular, as previously disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the material weakness relates to a lack of sufficient controls that allowed the following: 

Sales of near-prime loans  : During March and April of 2016, the Company effected sales of $22.3 million of near-prime loans in private transactions with an institutional investor that certain senior managers of the Company apparently were aware were not compliant with a specific non-credit, non-pricing requirement of the investor. In one case, involving approximately $3.0 million in loans, an application date was changed in a live Company database in an attempt to appear to meet the investor's requirement, and the balance of the loans was sold in direct contravention of the investor's direction. Employees involved in the sales of the near-prime loans that did not meet the investor's non-credit, non-pricing requirement were terminated or have resigned their positions. 
       
  Management determined that the Company s control deficiencies resulting from the Company s  tone at the top  permitted the circumvention of controls designed to ensure that investor portfolios are reviewed for adherence, and do adhere, to the investor s instructions. Additionally, management determined that incremental to existing change management processes, the Company had not designed and implemented an additional level of review and approval for live database changes that impact high risk fields to provide reasonable assurance that all loans allocated comply with investor instructions.  
    
  As previously reported in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, certain senior managers involved in the sales of near-prime loans that did not meet the investor s non-credit, non-pricing requirement were terminated or resigned in May of 2016. In addition, in the second quarter of 2016, to further improve our internal controls we updated our Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy. In the third quarter of 2016 we strengthened our data management controls by creating a data change classification matrix and plan to change approval process in the fourth quarter over live database changes of high risk fields prior to changes being made.  

Review of related party transactions  : The Board did not have the information required to review and approve or disapprove investments made by its former CEO in 2015 and 2016, and a member of its board of directors in 2015, in a holding company for a family of funds (Cirrix Capital, L.P.) that purchases loans and interests in loans from the Company in accordance with Company policies, including the Code of Conduct and Ethics. Although the Company was aware of these investments before they were made, the investments were not reported by the Company or by the respective investors to the board's Audit Committee or Risk Committee. In addition, the investments were not listed in questionnaires designed to identify such related party investments and provided to the Company by the former CEO and board member. 
       
  As a result, relevant information was not provided to the financial accounting and reporting function on a timely basis. This could have caused - but in this case did not cause - a failure to ensure that appropriate financial reporting of the transactions was made in all material respects in a timely manner. In addition, in  
  
   77 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 

March 2016 the Risk Committee approved an investment by the Company in Cirrix Capital, L.P. without all committee members being aware of the prior investments by the former CEO and the board member. 
    
  As a result of control deficiencies in the Company's "tone at the top" management determined that the Company's controls were not effective to ensure that information about related party investments known by certain members of management was adequately conveyed to other members of management and, ultimately, to the relevant committees of the board, including the audit and risk committees, on a timely basis. In addition, management determined that the Company s process to identify related party investments may not have been adequately designed to ensure that such investments were appropriately reported. 
    
  In the third quarter of 2016, we initiated a preliminary update to the Related Party Policy and communicated it to the directors. Additionally, we have trained all directors and officers on the revised Related Party Policy and new quarterly questionnaire that is used to report and communicate related transactions. We have also enhanced controls designed to ensure that a current list of related parties and other relevant information, if applicable, is communicated to appropriate functions. 

Lack of transparent communication and appropriate oversight of investor contract amendments  : In 2015 and more extensively during the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into contract amendments with platform investors, related to existing business arrangements. The Company failed in a number of cases to appropriately document or obtain authorizations of these amendments, assess the impact such amendments could have on pre-existing agreements and to communicate these amendments to the appropriate departments. As a result, the Company s accounting function was not always made aware of these amendments on a timely basis in order to enable it to assess the extent of any corresponding financial impacts or disclosure requirements in a timely manner. 
       
  Certain contract amendments were executed without transparent communication and appropriate oversight, reflecting the deficiencies in tone at the top. Specifically, management had not implemented existing controls over contract governance to include governance of investor contract amendments. Management determined that the Company had detective controls in place to identify amendments to contracts and to govern the documentation, authorization, communication and monitoring of investor agreements and contract amendments. However, management determined that, as a result of a design deficiency, the Company lacked key preventative controls designed to ensure that these processes and procedures were consistently followed for amendments to contracts. 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2016 we expect to implement or enhance new processes and controls that are designed to ensure that our investor contracts, including contract amendments, adhere to enhanced requirements established by the Risk Committee of the Board. We also plan to enhance our third-party contract management system to strengthen our controls surrounding the governance, review and ongoing monitoring for contract provisions and amendments. 
    
  The control improvements noted above to remediate and close this material weakness are subject to the Company s internal control testing and assessment process to ensure such controls are operating for a sufficient period of time and operating effectively. 
    
  While the material weakness described herein creates a reasonable possibility that an error in financial reporting may go undetected, after review and the performance of additional analysis and other procedures, no material adjustments, restatement or other revisions to our previously issued financial statements were required.  
    
  As part of the board review referenced above, the board retained an additional independent advisor who reviewed application data for all other whole loans applied for in the first quarter of 2016 and confirmed the accuracy of such data on the Company s systems, for all data other than the non-credit, non-pricing element that was changed as to $3.0 million of near-prime loans to a single investor described above. 

78 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 

Subject to the foregoing, no other change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) was identified during the third quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  For a discussion of legal proceedings, see    Part 1   Financial Information   Item 1   Financial Statements   Note 15   Commitments and Contingencies   Legal,    which is incorporated herein by reference. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  During the   first nine months of     2016  , there have been no material changes to the risk factors in    Part I   Item 1A   Risk Factors    in the Company's Annual Report, except as noted below. 
    
  Our business could be materially and adversely harmed as a result of the announcement of the results of our internal review and the resignation of our Chief Executive Officer (CEO). 
    
  As a result of recent events, numerous law firms have filed or have announced that they are looking into potentially filing lawsuits. As a result, we will be subject to significant litigation in the near future. In addition, we have been contacted by regulatory authorities requesting information related to the events surrounding the resignation of our former CEO, and we are cooperating fully with those inquiries. Litigation and inquiries of this nature are costly and time consuming, can generate negative publicity and could have a material and adverse effect on our business. 
    
  There can be no assurances as to the final outcome of any of these matters. The cost of defending any investigation or lawsuit is costly and can impose a significant burden on management and employees. Any litigation to which we are a party may result in onerous or unfavorable judgments that may not be reversed upon appeal or in payments of substantial monetary damages or fines, or we may decide to settle lawsuits on similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, or results of operations. 
    
  Unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business. 
    
  We have received a high degree of media coverage related to the results of our review and resignation of our former CEO. Unfavorable publicity regarding the events described herein has resulted in investors pausing their investments through the platform and may result in, a slowdown in investor demand on our platform. If this negatively publicity were to persist, it could further harm our reputation, and materially and adversely affect our business in the future. 
    
  A decline in social and economic conditions may adversely affect our customers, which may negatively impact our business and results of operations. 
    
  As a credit marketplace, we believe our customers are more highly susceptible to uncertainties and negative trends in the markets driven by, among other factors, general social and economic conditions in the United States and abroad. These social and economic factors may affect the ability or willingness of borrowers to make payments on their loans, and consequently, impact the credit performance of the loans, notes and certificates.  
  Lending Club monitors a variety of economic, credit and competitive indicators so that borrowers can benefit from meaningful savings compared to alternatives, and investors can continue to find attractive risk-adjusted returns compared to other fixed income investments or investment alternatives. Economic factors include interest rates, unemployment levels, gasoline prices, adjustments in monthly payments adjustable-rate mortgages and other debt  
  
   79 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 

payments, the rate of inflation and consumer perceptions of economic conditions. Social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels and changes in attitudes with respect to incurring debt and the stigma of personal bankruptcy. In the third quarter of 2016, we continued to observe mixed economic data, including an increased propensity for consumers to accumulate debt due to low interest rates, which caused us to remain cautious in our overall credit performance outlook.  
    
  Our marketplace has a number of levers at its disposal to adjust to changing market conditions, including the ability to quickly adapt underwriting models and dynamically increase or decrease pricing to provide an appropriate level of loss coverage to investors. Although we have observed some higher delinquencies in populations of loans characterized by high indebtedness, an increased propensity to accumulate debt, and lower credit scores across credit loan grades, it is less notable in lower risk grades. 
    
  These external economic conditions and resulting trends or uncertainties could adversely impact our customer's ability or desire to participate on our marketplace as borrowers or investors, and consequently could negatively affect our business and results of operations. See    Part 1   Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Current Economic and Business Environment.    
    
  Following the announcement of our board review and resignation of our former CEO, we experienced a slowdown in a significant amount of investment capital available on our platform. While some of these investors have returned, it is still possible that we may be unable to attract additional investors to invest in loans, or we may need to grant investors significant inducements in order to attract capital or use our own capital. 
    
  As a result of the circumstances relating to our board review into certain private loan sales to a single institutional investor in contravention of its requirements and other matters, and the resignation of our former CEO, a number of investors that account for, in the aggregate, a significant amount of investment capital on the platform, have paused their investments in loans through the platform. While many of these investors have returned, many have invested at reduced levels, and it is possible that some investors may not resume investing through our platform. As a result, we may use a greater amount of our own capital, compared to past experience, to invest in loans. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016 the Company offered incentives to investors to obtain additional capital for the platform. The Company has been focused on working with investors to resume their investment activity and bringing new investors to the platform. If these investors pause their investment activity again, the Company may need to provide further incentives, and enter into different additional incentive structures or terms, including the use of the Company's equity, to attract investor capital to the platform. Failure to attract investor capital on reasonable terms may result in the Company having to use additional capital to invest in loans or reduce origination volume. In order to obtain additional investor capital to our platform, we may need to enter into various arrangements with new or existing investors. These arrangements may have a number of different structures and terms, including equity or debt transactions, alternative fee arrangements or other inducements including equity. These structures may enable us or third-parties to purchase loans through the platform. Such actions may have a material impact on our business and results of operations and may be costly or dilutive to existing stockholders. There is no assurance that we will be able to enter into any of these transactions, or if we do, what the final terms will be. These actions likely may have material adverse impacts on the Company's business, financial condition (including its liquidity), results of operations and ability to sustain and grow loan volume. 
    
  A relatively small number of investors account for a large dollar amount of investment in loans funded through our marketplace and we may be required to increase our repurchase obligations to attract additional investors. 
    
  A relatively small number of investors account for a large dollar amount of investment in loans funded through our marketplace and we may be required to increase our repurchase obligations to attract additional investors. Historically, we have limited our loan or note repurchase obligations to events of verified identity theft or in connection with certain customer accommodations. To attract additional investors, some of which are beginning to purchase loans, and seek to subsequently securitize such loans, we have increased the circumstances and the required burden of proof of economic harm under which we are obligated to repurchase loans from these investors.  
  
   80 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 

While these repurchase obligations are consistent with institutional loan market standards for loans that may be securitized, such repurchase obligations could negatively affect our business and results of operation. 
    
  In addition, if a large number of our existing investors ceased utilizing our marketplace over a short period of time, our business could be temporarily interrupted and we may decide to use our capital to fulfill regulatory or contractual purchase obligations or support short-term marketplace equilibrium as new investors complete the administrative and diligence updating processes necessary to enable their investments. We may use our capital to invest in loans associated with the testing or initial launch of alternative loan terms, programs or channels to establish a track record of performance prior to facilitating third-party investments in these loans. 
    
  Misconduct and errors by our employees and third-party service providers could harm our business and reputation. 
    
  We are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of misconduct and errors by our employees, such as the change to application dates for $3.0 million in loans as described below, and other third-party service providers. Our business depends on our employees and third-party service providers to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions, and if any of our employees or third-party service providers take, convert or misuse funds, documents or data or fail to follow protocol when interacting with borrowers and investors, we could be liable for damages, be subject to repurchase obligations and subject to regulatory actions and penalties. We could also be perceived to have facilitated or participated in the illegal misappropriation of funds, documents or data, or the failure to follow protocol, and therefore be subject to civil or criminal liability. Because our subsidiary, LCA, is the general partner or investment manager for a series of private funds and we have a limited partnership interest in Cirrix Capital L.P. family of funds, we could be perceived as having a conflict of interest regarding access to loans versus other platform investors. We believe that we have controls and processes in place as to mitigate this issue. 
    
  Any of these occurrences could result in our diminished ability to operate our business, potential liability to borrowers and investors, inability to attract future borrowers and investors, reputational damage, regulatory intervention and financial harm, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  After the end of the first quarter of 2016, the Company became aware that approximately $22.3 million in near-prime loans were sold to a single institutional investor in March and April 2016, in contravention of the investor s express instructions as to a non-credit and non-pricing element. Certain personnel apparently were aware that the sales did not meet the investor s criteria. In one case, involving $3.0 million in loans, a non-credit, non-pricing attribute was changed in a live Company database in an attempt to appear to meet the investor s requirement, and the balance of the loans were sold in direct contravention of the investor s director. As a result of the board s review into these and other matters, certain senior managers and our then-CEO resigned or were terminated. In April 2016, we repurchased these loans from the investor. See    Part 1   Item 4   Controls and Procedures.    
    
  If we fail to retain our key personnel, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business could suffer. 
    
  In addition to attracting and retaining highly skilled employees in general, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including our executive officers, senior management team and other key personnel, all of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of our executive officers or members of our senior management team, and the process to replace any of them, would involve significant time and expense and distraction that may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives or impair our operations or results.   
    
  Subsequent to March 31, 2016, following an internal board review of certain loan sales and other matters, our CEO resigned, and certain senior managers either resigned or were terminated. We also implemented a reduction in workforce in June 2016 and attrition has been higher than usual in the months since the reduction in force. With any  
  
   81 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 

change in leadership and reduction in workforce, there is a risk to retention of employees, including other members of senior management, as well as the potential for disruption to business operations, initiatives, plans and strategies. In light of the circumstances surrounding these employee actions, we have offered significant additional compensation to retain certain employees, but we cannot predict whether we ultimately will be able to retain these or other employees in the future, or whether we will have to incur substantial additional cost to do so. In addition, in light of these recent events and their potential overall effect on our business and stock price, key executive officers or senior management may opt to depart the company to pursue other opportunities, which could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives or impair our operations or results. See    Part 1   Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Board Review.    
    
  Our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile. 
    
  As a result of recent events, our stock price has declined significantly since the end of the first quarter of 2016 and has exhibited substantial volatility. Recent developments notwithstanding, our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly operating results; changes in our financial projections provided to the public or our failure to meet those projections; changes in the credit performance on our platform; the public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; significant transactions, or new features, products or services by us or our competitors; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; media coverage of our business and financial performance; the operating and stock price performance of, or other developments involving, other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; trends in our industry; any significant change in our management; and general economic conditions. 
    
  In addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in our industry, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to operating performance. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock s price at a given point in time. Volatility in our stock price also impacts the value of our equity compensation, which affects our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been the target of this type of litigation and may continue to be a target in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. 
    
  If we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. A sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization could lead to impairment charges. 
    
  We have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements. 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As described in   "Item 4 - Controls and Procedures"  , we have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of June 30, 2016 due to material weakness. Specifically, our identified material weakness related to (i) appropriate system controls, or review and oversight by other personnel, to detect and prevent sales of loans in direct contravention of the loan agreement, (ii) failure to identify related party transactions so as to ensure proper review and approval or disapproval by the Audit Committee or the board, and (iii) failure to appropriately document, authorize, communicate and monitor amendments to investor contracts. Based upon that discovery, and in connection with the board review of specific near-prime loan sales to an investor and other unrelated compliance matters described elsewhere herein, the Company's CEO and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at a level that provides reasonable assurance that the objectives of disclosure controls and procedures were met as of September 30, 2016. As described in    Item 4    
  
   82 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 

Controls and Procedures,    the Company determined that the material weakness existed as of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and amended its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, solely for the purpose of amending management s assessment of internal control over financial reporting. This amendment will have impact on the financial statements included therein. 
    
  Giving full consideration to this weakness, and the additional analyses and other procedures we performed to ensure that our consolidated financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), our management has concluded that our consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods disclosed in conformity with GAAP. While the material weakness described above creates a reasonable possibility that an error in financial reporting may go undetected, after review and the performance of additional analysis and other procedures, no material adjustments, restatement or other revisions to our previously issued financial statements were required. 
    
  As further described in   "Item 4   Controls and Procedures,    we are taking specific steps to remediate the material weakness that we identified; however, the material weakness will not be remediated until the necessary controls have been implemented and we have determined the controls to be operating effectively. Because the reliability of the internal control process requires repeatable execution, the successful remediation of this material weakness will require review and evidence of effectiveness prior to concluding that the controls are effective. In addition, we may need to take additional measures to address the material weakness or modify the remediation steps, and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls will be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weakness will not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements. Implementing any appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees from other management duties and require material cost to implement new process or modify our existing processes. Moreover, other material weaknesses or deficiencies may develop or be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct the material weakness or deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, lead to delisting, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition. 
    
  There continues to be uncertainty as to how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) actions or the actions of any other federal or state regulator could impact our business or that of our issuing banks. 
    
  The CFPB, which commenced operations in July 2011, has broad authority over the businesses in which we engage. This includes authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and to enforce those laws against and examine large financial institutions, such as our issuing banks, for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent  unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices  through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. To assist in its enforcement, the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the loan products we facilitate. This system could inform future CFPB decisions with respect to its regulatory, enforcement or examination focus. 
    
  While we are subject to the regulatory and enforcement authority of the CFPB, as a facilitator, servicer or acquirer of consumer credit, the CFPB has recently announced that it intends to expand its supervisory authority, through the use of  larger participant rules,  to cover the markets for consumer installment loans and auto title loans. The CFPB is also considering whether rules to require registration of these or other non-depository lenders would facilitate supervision. The CFPB has not announced specifics regarding its proposed rulemaking and, consequently, there continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB s strategies and priorities, including any final rules, will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward. 

83 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 

Recognizing the growth in online marketplaces such as ours, in July 2015 the U.S. Treasury Department issued a request for information (RFI) to study the various business models and products offered by online marketplace lenders, the potential for online marketplace lending to expand access to credit to historically underserved borrowers and how the financial regulatory framework should evolve to support the safe growth of the industry. We, along with many other interested groups, submitted responses to the Treasury s RFI by the September 30, 2015 deadline. 
    
  On May 10, 2016, the U.S. Treasury Department released a white paper on the online marketplace lending industry to continue the work initiated by the RFI. The white paper includes several recommendations to the federal government and private sector participants to encourage safe growth and access to credit. We cannot predict whether any legislation or proposed rulemaking will actually be introduced or how any legislation or rulemaking will impact our business and results of operations going forward. 
    
  In December 2015, the California Department of Business Oversight sent an online survey to fourteen marketplace lenders, including us, requesting information about our business model, online platform, loan performance and investor funding process. In May 2016, the DBO requested additional information from us and other survey participants. We submitted our response to this additional information in June 2016. 
    
  If the loans originated through our marketplace were found to violate a state s usury laws, we may have to alter our business model and our business could be harmed. 
    
  The interest rates that are charged to borrowers and that form the basis of payments to investors through our marketplace are enabled by legal principles including (i) the application of federal law to enable an issuing bank that originates the loan to export the interest rates of the jurisdiction where it is located, or (ii) the application of common law  choice of law  principles based upon factors such as the loan document s terms and where the loan transaction is completed to provide uniform rates to borrowers, or (iii) the application of principles that allow the transferee of a loan to continue to collect interest as provided in the loan document. WebBank, the primary issuing bank of the loans originated through our marketplace, is chartered in, and operates out of, Utah, which allows parties to generally agree by contract to any interest rate. Certain states, including Utah, have no statutory interest rate limitations on personal loans, while other jurisdictions have a maximum rate. In some jurisdictions, the maximum rate is less than the current maximum rate offered by WebBank through our platform. If the laws of such jurisdictions were found to apply to the loans originated through our marketplace, those loans could be in violation of such laws. 
    
  In May 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit issued its decision in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC that interpreted the scope of federal preemption under the National Bank Act and held that a nonbank assignee of a loan originated by a national bank was not entitled to the benefits of federal preemption of claims of usury. The Second Circuit denied the defendant s motion to reconsider the decision and remanded the case to address choice of law matters. The Second Circuit s decision is binding on federal courts located in Connecticut, New York, and Vermont, but the decision could also be adopted by other courts. The defendant petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review the decision and in March 2016, the Court invited the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the U.S. on the petition. The Solicitor General filed an amicus brief that stated the Second Circuit decision was incorrect, but that the case was not yet ready to be heard by the Supreme Court.  In June 2016, the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. The Federal District Court is not hearing the case in regards to Midland s alternative claim regarding choice of laws, which if successful, could create potential liability under state statutes such as usury and consumer protection statutes. The petition was denied in June 2016. 
    
  There has been (and may continue to be) other litigation which has challenged lending arrangements where a bank has made a loan and then sells and assigns it to an entity that is engaged in assisting with the origination and servicing of a loan. For example, the CFPB recently alleged that the defendants in Consumer Financial Protection Bureau v. CashCall, Inc., et al (C.D. Cal August 31, 2016) engaged in unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices by servicing and collecting loans that state licensing and state usury laws had rendered partially or wholly uncollectible. The court in that case held that to identify the true lender of a loan the totality of the circumstances  
  
   84 

LENDINGCLUB CORPORATION 

and a  predominant economic interest  test should be considered.  If a similar test were applied in a case regarding our platform, there is no assurance the court would determine that our issuing bank partners have the predominant economic interest in loans facilitated through our platform. 
    
  In April 2016, a putative class action lawsuit was filed in federal court in New York, alleging that persons received loans, through our platform, that exceeded states' usury limits in violation of state usury and consumer protection laws, and the federal RICO statute. 
    
  If a borrower were to successfully bring claims against us for state usury law violations, and the rate on that borrower s personal loan was greater than that allowed under applicable state law, we could be subject to fines and penalties, including the voiding of loans and repayment of principal and interest to borrowers and investors. We might decide to limit the maximum interest rate on certain loans originated through our marketplace, and we might decide to originate loans under state-specific licenses, where this ruling is applicable. These actions could adversely impact our business. Further, if we were unable to partner with another issuing bank, we would have to substantially modify our business operations from the manner currently contemplated and would be required to maintain state-specific licenses and only provide a limited range of interest rates for personal loans, all of which would substantially reduce our operating efficiency and attractiveness to investors and possibly result in a decline in our operating results. 
    
  The announcement of our internal board review and resignation of our former CEO has resulted in government inquiries, books and records demands and private litigation and could result in government enforcement actions and private litigation that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, result in substantial costs and divert management s attention. 
    
  We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits (including class actions and individual lawsuits), government investigations, and other proceedings in the ordinary course of business. The number and significance of these disputes and inquiries have increased as a result of our internal board review and resignation of our former CEO.  
  We have received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and have been contacted by the SEC and other governmental entities.  We continue to cooperate with the DOJ, SEC and any other governmental or regulatory authorities or agencies.  In the first and second quarter of 2016, several putative class action lawsuits and shareholder derivative actions were filed.  The Company believes the plaintiffs  actions are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the claims. No assurance can be given as to the timing or outcome of these, or other matters.  Responding to inquiries and lawsuits of this nature is costly and time-consuming to management, can generate negative publicity, and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operation. See    Part 1 - Financial Information - Item 1 - Financial Statements - Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies - Legal    for additional information regarding these matters. 
    
  Any delay in the implementation of our technology systems could disrupt our operations and cause unanticipated increases in our costs  . 
    
  We believe the technology platform that powers our online marketplace enables us to deliver innovative solutions to borrowers and investors and provides a significant time and cost advantage over traditional banks that run on legacy systems.  The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our technology and our underlying network infrastructure are critical to our operations, customer service, reputation and our ability to attract new and retain existing borrowers and investors.  In addition, our future growth prospects are highly dependent on our ability to implement changes to our technology platform to support the future demands of our customers and industry.  Our failure to implement changes to our technology platform and adapt to our customers  changing technological needs and requirements or to hire and retain a sufficient number of engineers and maintain our engineering, and technological expertise could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

A Purchaser Online Account may be used by Purchaser to purchase and hold Loans meeting only one of the Credit Criteria described in the related Addendum (i.e., Loans sold pursuant to a particular Loan Program).  By way of example only, if Purchaser participates in both the  Prime  Loan Program and the  Near Prime  Loan Program, Purchaser shall open two Purchaser Online Accounts and execute the two applicable Addenda. 
           2.2 
    Purchase Procedures for Offer, Commitment and Funding of Purchased Loans.    
     (a)        Purchase Procedures for Offer.     Commencing on a Launch Date, Seller will grant Purchaser the right to view applicable Eligible Loans through the applicable Purchaser Online Account.   
  (b)        Purchase Commitments.   From time to time, Purchaser may make a Purchase Commitment (subject to any applicable Purchase Limitation) for each Loan Program in which it participates (i.e., each Loan Program for which Purchaser has executed an Addendum). Each Purchase Commitment shall be made by (i) Purchaser, in its sole discretion, or (ii) Seller, acting upon its delegated non-discretionary authority to make Purchase Commitments on behalf of Purchaser (if such authority is delegated to Seller pursuant to the terms of the applicable Addendum).  Seller commits to offer Purchaser, and Purchaser hereby commits to purchase Eligible Loans in respect of which any Purchase Commitment is made in accordance with the terms of the immediately preceding sentence; provided, however, that any such prospective Eligible Loan that becomes a Non-Offered Loan shall be released and removed from any Purchase Commitment.  Purchaser will be irrevocably obligated to purchase each such Eligible Loan that does not become a Non-Offered Loan.  Seller will provide a Purchaser Activity Status Report listing all the Eligible Loans that are subject to a Purchase Commitment.  Prior to making any Purchase Commitment, Purchaser will have an amount of funds available in the Purchaser Online Account equal to such Purchase Commitment plus the aggregate amount of all outstanding Purchase Commitments, unless otherwise agreed between the Parties in writing.  Unless otherwise agreed to in Seller s sole discretion, Purchaser shall only be able to execute Purchase Commitments to the extent of immediately available funds in the Purchaser Online Account.  Any determination as to whether to make a Purchase Commitment for any Eligible Loan shall be deemed to be in Purchaser s sole discretion and at Purchaser s own risk that information supplied by any Borrower may be incorrect, and Seller makes no representation as to the correctness of any information provided by any Borrower with respect to any Eligible Loan.    
  (c)        Eligible Loan Status and Funding.     With respect to each Eligible Loan to which Purchaser is committed, Seller shall provide prompt notice to Purchaser of any change to the ongoing status of the prospective Eligible Loan, including whether such Loan has become a Non-Offered Loan or such Loan is ready for purchase by Purchaser.  Seller will debit the Purchaser Online  
  
   MASTER LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT   Page G 

Account for the full purchase price of each Purchased Loan as indicated through the Purchaser Online Account (the    Purchase Price   ).  Purchaser will not withdraw funds from the Purchaser Online Account if, after such withdrawal, immediately available funds in such Purchaser Online Account would be less than the dollar amount necessary to meet Purchaser s aggregate Purchase Commitments as of the applicable Purchase Date, unless otherwise agreed to by Seller in Seller s sole discretion. 
  (d)        Expiration of Purchase Commitments.   The Purchase Commitment for each Eligible Loan shall expire thirty (30) Business Days following the date on which the Purchase Commitment for such Eligible Loan was made (the    Expiration Date   ). If the Purchase Date for such Eligible Loan has not occurred on or before such Expiration Date, Purchaser may withdraw any funds from the Purchaser Online Account that were deposited, wired or otherwise made available to Seller in respect of such Purchase Commitment.       
  (e)        Purchase Limitation.     Seller may impose a limit on the aggregate amount of Purchase Commitments that Purchaser may make in a given month with respect to one or more Addenda (each, a    Purchase Limitation   ).  If Seller wishes to impose such a limit, Seller will provide Purchaser thirty (30) days  prior written notice, informing Purchaser of the total aggregate dollar limit of Purchase Commitments that Seller will accept.  The Purchase Limitation will go into effect on the first day of the month immediately following the thirtieth day following the notice, and will apply for each month going forward until Seller provides notice that the Purchase Limitation has been modified or lifted.  If a Purchase Limitation is in place, Purchaser will not be permitted to make Purchase Commitments in excess of such Purchase Limitation without prior approval of Seller, which approval may be withheld in the sole and absolute discretion of Seller. For the avoidance of doubt, a breach of this Section 2.2(e) by Purchaser shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.

   MASTER LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT   Page H 

received from the Borrower of such Loan shall be subject to retention by Servicer of any interest and fees that accrued on such Loan prior to the respective Purchase Date. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Purchase Price for each Eligible Loan reflects an arms-length negotiation, resolution and transaction.

           2.5 
    Modification of Loan Document Package  .   
     If any of the documents included in a Loan Document Package are modified, amended, or replaced by Seller in a manner that alters the economic terms of the Loan other than as contemplated by the Loan Documents prior to the Purchase Date, then Seller shall submit notice of such modifications, amendments, or replacement documents to Purchaser, together with a summary of the changes made, at least four (4) Business Days prior to such Purchase Date (or such other number of days as may be agreed to by Purchaser).

           2.6 
    Limitation on Purchase Obligation.

  (a)        In connection with the sale and conveyance of the Purchased Loans, Seller agrees, to indicate or cause to be indicated in its books, records and computer files that the Purchased Loans have been sold to Purchaser. 
  (b)        During the term of this Agreement, and for so long as Seller is the Servicer of the Purchased Loans, Seller shall maintain accurate Records with respect to such Purchased Loans in accordance with the terms of the Servicing Agreement.

To the extent any provision of this Addendum No. 5 conflicts with any other provision of the Master Loan Purchase Agreement, the provision of this Addendum No. 5 shall govern.

               III.  Purchase Requirement and Loan Program Mechanics 

The following provisions supplement those contained in   Section 2.2   of the Master Loan Purchase Agreement with respect to Purchased Loans satisfying the Credit Criteria outlined in this Addendum No. 5: 
  (a)        With respect to Eligible Loans offered to Purchaser by Seller pursuant to the Credit Criteria specifications of this Addendum No. 5, Seller and Purchaser shall mutually agree in writing to a Purchase Requirement.  At least thirty (30) days prior to the first day of each month, or as otherwise agreed between the Parties in writing, Seller and Purchaser will mutually agree as to the Purchase Requirement for such month.  Such Purchase Requirement will go into effect on the first day of such month and will apply for each month going forward until Seller and Purchaser mutually agree in writing to modify such Purchase Requirement.  For the avoidance of doubt, Seller may, but is not required to offer to Purchaser, an amount of Eligible Loans equal to the Purchase Requirement and its offer of no Eligible Loans or an amount of Eligible Loans that is less than the Purchase Requirement shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.  
  (b)        Purchaser agrees to make a Purchase Commitment for all Eligible Loans offered to Purchaser by Seller pursuant to the Credit Criteria specifications outlined in this Addendum No. 5 (other than those that become Non-Offered Loans and to the extent Eligible Loans are available) in any given calendar month until such time as Purchaser has made Purchase Commitments for an amount of Eligible Loans (based upon Purchase Price) equal to the Purchase Requirement for such month.  Each Eligible Loan offered to Purchaser by Seller, in Seller s sole discretion, up to the Purchase Requirement will be deemed to be subject to a Purchase Commitment upon offer.  After meeting the Purchase Requirement for any calendar month, upon the mutual agreement between Seller and Purchaser and to the extent Eligible Loans are available, Seller may offer, additional Eligible Loans during such month subject to the Purchase Limitation.  
    
  (c)        Seller may strive to allocate Eligible Loans among purchasers participating in the Loan Program covered by this Addendum No. 5 in an equitable manner so that all purchasers have an equitable opportunity to purchase Eligible Loans pursuant to the Credit Criteria specifications outlined in this Addendum No. 5. However, Purchaser acknowledges that Seller may, in its sole and absolute discretion, allocate Eligible Loans to participants in the Multi-Draw Line of Credit Loan Program in a manner that does not result in all participants having an equal distribution of Eligible Loans, whether across grade, term or amount. 
    
  (d)        Purchaser acknowledges that each Eligible Loan offered to Purchaser by Seller pursuant to the terms of this Addendum No. 5 constitutes a single  loan advance  made to a Borrower under such Borrower s Line of Credit pursuant to the applicable Line Agreement. As a result, multiple investor participants in the Multi-Draw Line of Credit Loan Program may purchase Eligible Loans constituting  loan advances  issued under the same Line of Credit to a given Borrower. Purchaser further acknowledges that any payments received from a Borrower shall be treated as a payment against the entire Line of Credit under the Line Agreement and allocated pro rata among Purchaser and any other investors owning Loans corresponding to  loan advances  issued under the same Line of Credit as follows: 
           (i) 
    Billed fees; then 
              (ii) 
    Billed interest; then 
              (iii) 
    Billed principal; then 
              (iv) 
    Unbilled principal; then 
              (v) 
    Unbilled fees; then 
              (vi) 
    Unbilled interest. 
     For the avoidance of doubt,  pro rata  for purposes of each waterfall calculation above shall be separately based on each payment category. By way of example only, if Purchaser owns a Purchased Loan corresponding to a  loan advance  issued under a Line of Credit (and at least one additional  loan advance  has been extended to the Borrower under the Line of Credit), Purchaser s  pro rata  allocation of  billed interest  in waterfall scenario (i) above with respect to that Purchased Loan would be calculated as (a) the amount of billed interest owed to Purchaser with respect to that Purchased Loan,   divided by   (b) the total amount of billed interest owed under that Line of Credit,   multiplied by   (c) the lesser of (i) the total payment received less any billed fees and (ii) the total billed interest under the Line of Credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all distributions and payments owed to Purchaser with respect to Purchased Loans shall be made by Servicer in accordance with the terms of the Servicing Agreement.  
    
               IV.  Representations, Warranties and Covenants

Purchaser is the owner of the Servicing Rights relating to each Loan serviced by Servicer hereunder; except that Servicing Rights shall not include the customer relationship with, or the right to market to, Borrower, which rights shall remain with Servicer.  
  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Servicer shall have, as Purchaser s independent contractor, all Servicing Rights associated with the Loans.  Servicer shall establish and maintain a Servicing File with respect to each Loan in order to service such Loan pursuant to this Agreement, and such Servicing File is and shall be held in trust by Servicer on behalf of and for the benefit of Purchaser, as purchaser thereof.  Each Loan Document and the contents of the Servicing File shall be vested in Purchaser, and the ownership of all records and documents with respect to the related Loan prepared by or which come into the possession or control of Servicer shall immediately vest in Purchaser and shall be retained and maintained, in trust, by Servicer at the will of Purchaser in such custodial capacity only. Each Servicing File shall be maintained electronically and shall be appropriately identified or recorded to reflect the ownership of the related Loan by Purchaser.  Servicer shall release from its custody the contents of any Servicing File retained by it only in accordance with this Agreement, and Purchaser shall thereafter hold such Servicing File in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.  To the extent that original documents are not required for purposes of realization of Loan proceeds, documents maintained by Servicer will be in digital format. 
  Servicer shall maintain the Servicing Files and the Loan Documents electronically, and such files and documents may be accessed through the Purchaser Online Account(s) or at the Servicer Physical Payment Address or such other physical location as designated by Servicer in writing; provided, however, that in no event shall such physical location be located outside the continental United States. 
  Record title to each Loan and the related Promissory Note shall remain in the name of Purchaser.  Control and ownership of each Loan shall be established by an electronic record of such Loan that: (i) contains an identifiable and authoritative copy of the Loan Documents;  (ii) identifies Purchaser as the purchaser of the Loan; (iii) is made available to Purchaser through the applicable Purchaser Online Account; (iv) is not altered to add or change the identification of Purchaser as purchaser of the Loan without the participation of Purchaser; and (v) is not revised except in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Loan Documents, or with the written consent of Purchaser, or unless required by Applicable Law.  Servicer shall maintain such electronic record for each Loan as bailee and custodian on behalf of Purchaser at all times during the term of this Agreement. 
           2.2 
    Assignment and Delegation of Duties. 
     Servicer may assign or delegate any of its duties and obligations hereunder to any Subcontractors or Collection Agents; provided that, unless otherwise agreed to between Servicer and Purchaser, Servicer shall remain responsible for the performance of such duties and obligations in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and shall be liable for the acts or omissions of any such Subcontractor or Collection Agent in performing the same, and any such assignment or delegation will not relieve Servicer of its liabilities and responsibilities with respect to such duties and obligations under this Agreement, and shall not constitute a resignation within the meaning of   Section 6.3   hereof.  
  2.3        Assistance and Cooperation of Purchaser  . 
  If any actions of Purchaser are necessary or appropriate in connection with the servicing and administration of the Loans hereunder, then Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to perform such actions in a timely manner and to cooperate with and assist Servicer in connection with such actions; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement and except as specified above, Servicer shall have the exclusive right to maintain and develop the customer relationship with, and the right to market to, any Borrower; and provided further that, so long as LendingClub (or an Affiliate or other designee of LendingClub) remains Servicer under this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor any Person acting on behalf of Purchaser shall contact any Borrower without the prior written consent of Servicer, unless Purchaser or its designee (or an Affiliate thereof) is acting as a Collection Agent on behalf of Servicer.  
  ARTICLE III          SERVICING OF LOANS 
    3.1      Servicer to Service.

  Servicer may grant, permit or facilitate any Loan Modification for any Loan in accordance with the Accepted Servicing Practices and provided that such Loan Modification is, in Servicer s reasonable determination, a practical way to obtain a reasonable recovery from such Loan.  Servicer shall notify Purchaser through the applicable Purchaser Online Account of any Loan Modification granted, permitted or facilitated by Servicer.  Servicer shall not charge any Borrower any fees not contemplated in the Loan Documents without giving effect to any Loan Modifications or other amendments or modifications directed by Servicer in accordance with this Agreement. 
  In furtherance of the foregoing, Servicer is hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver on behalf of itself and Purchaser, all notices or instruments of satisfaction, cancellation or termination, or of partial or full release, discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Loans; provided, however, that Servicer shall not be entitled to release, discharge, terminate or cancel any Loan or the related Loan Documents unless (i) such Loan is a Charged Off Loan, (ii) Servicer shall have received payment in full of all principal, interest and fees owed by the Borrower related thereto, or (iii) Servicer accepts a reduced payment of principal, interest and fees owed on such Loan that is a Nonperforming Loan, in each case in accordance with the Accepted Servicing Practices.  If reasonably required by Servicer, Purchaser shall furnish Servicer with any powers of attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under this Agreement, and Servicer shall indemnify and hold Purchaser harmless for any costs, liabilities or expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with any use of such power of attorney by Servicer or its agents in breach of this Agreement. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Servicer shall comply with the commercially reasonable written instructions of Purchaser necessary to comply with any regulatory requirements applicable to, or agreed to by, Purchaser or any supervisory rules agreed to or imposed on Purchaser and delivered to Servicer from time to time with respect to the servicing of the Loans. It is understood by the Parties hereto that in the event of any conflict between this Agreement and Purchaser s written instructions, Purchaser s written instructions shall control; provided, however, that in the event that there is a conflict between Purchaser s written instructions and any Applicable Law, the Accepted Servicing Practices, or the Loan Documents, Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser with prompt notice of such conflict, and in such case, the Applicable Law, the Accepted Servicing Practices or the Loan Documents shall control, in the foregoing order of priority, to resolve the conflict.    
    3.2      Collection of Payments and Liquidation of Loans.     
  (a)      Collection of Payments.    Continuously from the related Purchase Date until the date each Loan becomes a Liquidated Loan or otherwise ceases to be subject to this Agreement, in accordance with the Accepted Servicing Practices, Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect all Monthly Payments and any other payments due under each of the Loans when the same shall become due and payable. 
  (b)      Loss Mitigation.    With respect to any Loan, in accordance with the Accepted Servicing Practices, Servicer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to realize upon Loans in such a manner that reasonably attempts to maximize the receipt of principal and interest for Purchaser, including pursuing any Loan Modification pursuant to   Section 3.1   or pursuing other loss mitigation or other default recovery actions consistent with the Accepted Servicing Practices.   
  (c)      Charged Off Loans.    Promptly following any Loan satisfying the charge off criteria as set forth in its Charge Off Policy, Servicer shall, in accordance with the Charge Off Policy, charge off the related Loan (the date of such charge off being the    Charge Off Date    and each such Loan, a    Charged Off Loan   ).  Servicer may, but is not required to, facilitate the sale and transfer of the Loan and the Loan Documents for such Charged Off Loan to a Charged Off Loan Purchaser (other than Charged Off Loans that are deemed non-conforming or ineligible for purchase by such Charged Off Loan Purchaser) and Servicer shall be relieved of its ongoing servicing and collection obligations hereunder, except with respect to causing any proceeds to be deposited into the applicable Purchaser Online Account pursuant to   Sections 3.2(e) and (f)  .  
  (d)      Power of Attorney.    Concurrent with the signing of this Agreement, Purchaser shall deliver a fully executed, notarized Power of Attorney in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit C,   naming Servicer as Purchaser s attorney-in-fact to: (i) carry out the terms of   Section 3.2(c)   in connection with the sale and transfer of a Charged Off Loan; (ii) execute a joinder agreement joining Purchaser to an agreement or agreements between Servicer and (A) a Charged Off Loan Broker and (B) a Charged Off Loan Purchaser; and (iii) take any action and execute any instruments or documents that Servicer may deem reasonably necessary or advisable to transfer and convey each of the Charged Off Loans from Purchaser to a Charged Off Loan Purchaser or its successors or assignees in accordance with this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement. 
  (e)      Establishment of and Deposits to the Applicable Purchaser Online Account.     
  Prior to its purchase of Loans, Purchaser shall establish the related Purchaser Online Account(s), in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement.  Purchaser shall grant and provide Servicer with rights to cause funds to be deposited into and withdrawn from the Purchaser Online Account(s) for the purpose of performing its servicing functions pursuant to this Agreement, including without limitation by way of automated clearing house (   ACH   ) transfer.     
  Servicer shall cause to be deposited into the applicable Purchaser Online Account within four (4) Business Days (or two (2) Business Days for purposes of Loans purchased pursuant to the terms of Addendum No. 5 (Multi-Draw Line of Credit Loan Program), if applicable) of the receipt of payment by Servicer (but not by an agent of Servicer, Subcontractor or Collection Agent) the following collections received from the Loans and payments made by the related Borrowers after each Purchase Date (clauses (i) through (v) below, collectively, the    Proceeds   ): 
           (i) 
    all payments on account of principal on the Loans, including all Principal Prepayments; 
              (ii) 
    all payments on account of interest and fees (excluding Ancillary Fees) on the Loans; 
              (iii) 
    all Liquidation Proceeds;  
              (iv) 
    to the extent not otherwise included in any other clauses of this   Section 3.2(e)  , any net proceeds from the Loans whether by any Subcontractor or Collection Agent; and 
              (v) 
    any other collections from the Loans and any other amounts required to be deposited or transferred into the applicable Purchaser Online Account pursuant to this Agreement; 
     provided, however, that Servicer or Bank shall be entitled to withhold and retain any interest and fees that accrued on any Loans prior to their respective Purchase Dates.  Following the deposit of Proceeds due to Purchaser into a Purchaser Online Account, Servicer will distribute or reinvest principal and interest Proceeds in accordance with Purchaser s elections set forth on   Exhibit D   to this Agreement (the    P I Election Instructions   ). The P I Election Instructions provided by Purchaser to Servicer in connection with the execution of this Agreement shall be effective as of the date they are accepted by Servicer in writing and will apply for each subsequent calendar month during the term of this Agreement, unless superseded by new P I Election Instructions. 
  Notwithstanding the above, Liquidation Proceeds due to Purchaser from the sale of Charged Off Loans sold on behalf of Purchaser will be retained by Servicer until the expiration of any period during which any Charged Off Loan Purchaser is contractually permitted to require repurchase by Purchaser under any agreement relating to the sale of Charged Off Loans to which Purchaser has been contractually joined pursuant to   Section 3.2(d)  . 
  In the event that Servicer receives any payments on any Loans directly from or on behalf of the Borrower or any payments at a Servicer Physical Payment Address, Servicer shall receive all such payments in trust for the sole and exclusive benefit of Purchaser, and shall cause to be deposited into the applicable Purchaser Online Account within six (6) Business Days (or four (4) Business Days for purposes of Loans purchased pursuant to the terms of Addendum No. 5 (Multi-Draw Line of Credit Loan Program), if applicable) of receipt by Servicer (but not by an agent of Servicer, Subcontractor or Collection Agent) all such payments described in this   Section 3.2  . 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) payments in the nature of Servicing Compensation may be retained by Servicer and need not be deposited into the Purchaser Online Account(s), and (b) Servicer may net any amounts that it is entitled to hereunder against any funds for deposit to the Purchaser Online Account(s) in accordance with   Section 3.2(f)  .  Any benefit derived from funds deposited into the Purchaser Online Account(s) shall accrue to the benefit of Purchaser. 
  If applicable, in addition and subject to the foregoing, for purposes of Loans purchased pursuant to the terms of Addendum No. 5 (Multi-Draw Line of Credit Loan Program) (as such Addendum is described in further detail in the Purchase Agreement), Servicer agrees to allocate collections received from the Loans and payments made by the related Borrowers after each Purchase Date in accordance with the terms of Section III(d) of Addendum No. 5 (Multi-Draw Line of Credit Loan Program). 
  (f)      Permitted Netting and Withdrawal of Proceeds.     
  Servicer shall, from time to time, be allowed to offset against Proceeds prior to deposit into the applicable Purchaser Online Account and, if necessary, withdraw from the applicable Purchaser Online Account funds for the following purposes: 
           (i) 
    to pay itself the earned and unpaid Servicing Compensation on such dates as determined by Servicer, subject to providing prior notice as described below; or 
              (ii) 
    to remove funds transferred in error or funds that are required to be returned for any reason (including for the avoidance of doubt, a Borrower s failed ACH payment or a Borrower s ACH payment that is returned after settlement), subject in each case to providing information regarding the offset or withdrawal as described below.     
     In the case of clause (i) above, prior to the netting or withdrawal or, in the case of clause (ii) above, within five (5) Business Days after the netting or withdrawal, Servicer shall provide  Purchaser with information regarding any netting or withdrawal of funds subject to clauses (i) or (ii) above, together with reasonable supporting details.  Servicer shall keep and maintain, in a digital format reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, separate accounting records, on a Loan by Loan basis, for the purpose of substantiating any deposits into and withdrawals from the applicable Purchaser Online Account or netting of Proceeds as permitted above.

  Servicer shall accurately and fully furnish, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing regulations, as well as Servicer s own policies and practices, accurate and complete information (e.g., favorable and unfavorable) on its Borrower credit files to each of the following credit repositories, as applicable:  Trans Union, LLC and Experian Information Solution, Inc.   
  Servicer shall deliver or otherwise make available to Purchaser or its designee the following reports in a digital format during the term of this Agreement: 
           (i)

In addition to the foregoing, this Agreement shall also be deemed to be  Confidential Information.    Recipient shall protect the disclosed Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but no less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination, or publication of the Confidential Information as Recipient uses to protect its own Confidential Information of a like nature.  Recipient s obligations shall only extend to (a) information that is marked as confidential at the time of disclosure, (b) information that is unmarked (e.g., orally, visually or tangibly disclosed) but which the Discloser informs the Recipient should be treated as confidential at the time of disclosure, or (c) information that a reasonable person would understand to be confidential.  This Agreement imposes no obligation upon Recipient with respect to information that:  (1) was in Recipient s possession before receipt from Discloser as evidenced by its books and records prior to the receipt of such information; (2) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of Recipient, or its employees, consultants, advisors, officers or directors or Affiliates; (3) is rightfully received by Recipient from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (4) is disclosed by Discloser to a third party without a duty of confidentiality on the third party; (5) is independently developed by Recipient without reference to the Confidential Information; (6) is disclosed under operation of law (including in connection with a regulatory examination of the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates); or (7) is disclosed by Recipient with Discloser s prior written approval.  In addition to the foregoing, Purchaser covenants that it will not use, in violation of any Applicable Law, any material non-public information that has been provided to it by Servicer in Purchaser s decision to invest in any securities issued by Servicer, provided that the Loans shall not be considered securities for the purposes of this   Section 3.3(a)  . Recipient may disclose Confidential Information to its officers, directors, employees, trustees, members, partners, potential and existing financing sources (including, with respect to Purchaser, any potential or existing investor in, and Person acting as a trustee or service provider in connection with, asset-backed securities for which the Loans are included in the collateral or trust assets), advisors or representatives (including, without limitation, attorneys, accountants, insurers, rating agencies, consultants, bankers, financial advisors, custodian and backup servicer) (collectively,    Representatives   ) who need to have access to such Confidential Information. Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this   Section 3.3(a)   by any of its Representatives. 
  (b)      Additional Confidentiality and Security.   In addition to its general obligation to comply with Applicable Law and the obligations of   Section 3.3(a)  , the Parties shall also adhere to the following requirements regarding the confidentiality and security of Borrower Information and Loan Documents:

    Each Party shall assess, manage, and control risks relating to the security and confidentiality of Borrower Information, and shall implement the standards relating to such risks in the manner set forth in the applicable provisions of the Privacy Requirements. 
              (3) 
    Without limiting the scope of the above, each Party shall use at least the same physical and other security measures to protect all Borrower Information in such Party s possession or control, as such Party uses for its own confidential and proprietary information. 
              (4) 
    At Servicer s reasonable request, Servicer may review and request details with respect to Purchaser s Information Security Program. 
              (ii) 
    Compliance With Privacy Requirements  .    The Parties shall comply with all applicable Privacy Requirements. 
              (iii)

Any Confidential Information retained pursuant to this provision shall remain subject to the terms of this Agreement. 
           3.4

Any such fidelity bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance policy shall protect and insure Servicer against losses, including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and negligent acts of such Servicer Employees. No provision of this   Section 3.4   requiring such Errors and Omissions Insurance policy shall diminish or relieve Servicer from its duties and obligations as set forth in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding   Section 5.3(a)(i)   above, Servicer shall have no obligation to do any of the following: (A) except for acts or omissions that constitute fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Servicer or its employees or agents, indemnify any Indemnified Purchaser Party for any punitive damages or for any actual or lost profits of such Indemnified Purchaser Party, regardless of whether Servicer knew or was aware of such possible Losses; or (B) indemnify or hold harmless an Indemnified Purchaser Party from and against any Losses to the extent such Losses result from the negligence or willful misconduct of or material breach of this Agreement by any potential Indemnified Purchaser Party. 
  (iii)        Purchaser Claims Notice  .  Purchaser shall be responsible for making any claim for indemnity pursuant to this   Section 5.3(a)   on behalf of any Indemnified Purchaser Party. Purchaser shall provide written notice (a    Purchaser Claims Notice   ) to Servicer describing any claim for indemnity pursuant to   Section 5.3(a)(i)   within sixty (60) days after the date on which Purchaser has or receives notice of or otherwise has actual knowledge of the applicable breach to the extent such breach is not otherwise known to Servicer. 
  (iv)        Servicer Response Process  .  If Servicer disagrees with the claim set forth in a Purchaser Claims Notice, Servicer shall formally dispute the claim in a writing delivered to Purchaser within thirty (30) days of receipt of such Purchaser Claims Notice.

  (v)        Assignment and Multi-Party Agreements  . For the avoidance of doubt, (a) Purchaser hereby acknowledges that it bears the risk of non-payment by the obligors of the Loans and associated credit-related losses in respect thereof, and indemnification shall not be available for any such non-payment or associated losses under this Agreement, (b) to the extent that that any rights of Purchaser hereunder, or under the Purchase Agreement (including any executed Addenda) or any Multi-Party Agreement are assigned or otherwise transferred to a third party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or such other agreements, as applicable, any such assignee or beneficiary shall not, unless the transfer was made in a Securitization Transaction or Whole Loan Transfer or otherwise consented to in writing by Servicer, be permitted to claim indemnification hereunder and, if the transfer was made in a Securitization Transaction or Whole Loan Transfer or any such consent shall have been provided by Servicer, shall be bound by the limits on indemnification contained in this   Section 5.3(a)   as if such assignee or beneficiary were Purchaser, and such assignee or beneficiary may only claim indemnity in conjunction with, or in place of, Purchaser and (c) multiple recoveries for any single breach shall not be permitted.  
  (vi)        Repurchase Obligation  .  Nothing in this Section 5.3 is intended to or shall limit the rights of Purchaser under   Sections 7.1   and   7.2   of the Purchase Agreement. 
  (b)        Purchaser s Indemnification.   Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Servicer and its Affiliates, trustees, directors, officers, employees, members, managers, representatives, stockholders and agents (each, an    Indemnified Servicer Party   ) from and against any Losses incurred by Servicer in connection with this Agreement to the extent that such Losses arise out of, and are imposed upon any such Indemnified Servicer Party by reason of, (a) any material breach by Purchaser of   Sections 3.3  ,   3.4  ,   4.2   or   5.2   of this Agreement or (b) Purchaser s gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of its duties under this Agreement.  Servicer shall provide prompt written notice (a    Servicer Claims Notice   , and together with a Purchaser Claims Notice and as the context suggests, each a    Claims Notice   ) to Purchaser of any claim for indemnity pursuant to this   Section 5.3(b)  .  In the case of any claim for indemnity made pursuant to this   Section 5.3(b)  , if Purchaser does not dispute the claim made by Servicer in writing within thirty (30) days of receipt of the related Servicer Claims Notice, Purchaser shall make payment of the applicable indemnification amount to Servicer within sixty (60) days of receipt of the related Servicer Claims Notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have no obligation to do any of the following:   (i) except for acts or omissions that constitute fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct of Purchaser or its employees or agents, indemnify any Indemnified Servicer Party for any punitive damages or for any actual or lost profits of such Indemnified Servicer Party, regardless of whether Purchaser knew or was aware of such possible Losses, or (ii) indemnify or hold harmless an Indemnified Servicer Party from and against any Losses to the extent such Losses result from the negligence or willful misconduct of or breach of this Agreement by any Indemnified Servicer Party. 
  (c)        Notice of Claims.    Each Party against whom a claim for indemnity pursuant to this   Section 5.3(c)   shall have been made (each, an    Indemnifying Party   ) shall have the right to defend the Person seeking such indemnity (each, an    Indemnified Party   ) with counsel of such Indemnifying Party s choice in respect of any third party claim, so long as (i) such counsel is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have provided written notice to the Indemnified Party, within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the related Claims Notice, indicating that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of this   Section 5.3   and (iii) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the third party claim or matter actively and diligently.  The Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain separate co-counsel and participate in the defense of any such claim or matter; provided that any related attorneys  fees shall not be indemnifiable Losses unless the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party are both defendants in the matter for which the indemnity is sought and the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel representing the Parties an actual conflict of interest would arise in such counsel s continued representation of both Parties.  Knowledge by an Indemnified Party of any breach or non-compliance hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such Indemnified Party s rights and remedies under this Agreement unless such Indemnified Party shall have failed to notify the applicable Indemnifying Party of such breach or non-compliance in a timely manner in accordance with the terms of this   Article V  .  No express or implied waiver by an Indemnified Party of any default hereunder shall in any way be, or be construed to be, a waiver of any other default.  The failure or delay of an Indemnified Party to exercise any of its rights granted hereunder regarding any default shall not constitute a waiver of any such right as to any other default, and any single or partial exercise of any particular right granted to an Indemnified Party hereunder shall not exhaust the same or constitute a waiver of any other right provided herein. 
  ARTICLE VI          ADDITIONAL COVENANTS 
           6.1. 
    Existence, Qualification. 
     Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and franchises, and shall obtain and preserve its licenses or other approvals to service the Loans and its qualifications to do business in each jurisdiction in which such licenses, approvals and qualifications are or shall be necessary to protect the validity and enforceability of this Agreement and to perform the servicing of the Loans under this Agreement, except where such failure could not be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Servicer. 
           6.2. 
    Limitation on Liability of Servicer and Others.   
     Neither Servicer nor any of the directors, officers, employees or agents of Servicer shall have any liability to Purchaser for taking any action or refraining from taking any action in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in judgment, provided, however, that this provision shall not protect Servicer or any such Person against any material breach of any covenants, warranties or representations made herein or any liability for Servicer s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Servicer and any director, officer, employee or agent of Servicer may rely in good faith, without investigation, on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder.  Servicer shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action which is not incidental to its duties to service the Loans in accordance with this Agreement and which in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability, provided, however, that Servicer may undertake any such action which it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement and the rights and duties of the Parties hereto.  In such event, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Servicer shall be entitled to full and prompt reimbursement from Purchaser for the reasonable legal expenses and costs of such action. 
  6.3.  Limitation on Resignation by Servicer.   Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed on it except by mutual consent of Servicer and Purchaser or upon Servicer s reasonable determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible under Applicable Law and such incapacity cannot be cured by Servicer without unreasonable costs or expenses. Any such determination permitting the resignation of Servicer shall be in the reasonable discretion of Servicer.  
           6.4. 
    Relationship With Customers.    Purchaser acknowledges that LendingClub will maintain an ongoing relationship with the Borrower of each Loan, and Purchaser agrees that it will have no marketing rights with respect to any Borrower. 
              6.5. 
    Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan.      Servicer shall, at its own expense, design, implement, and maintain a business continuity and disaster recovery program and viable response and recovery capabilities for the services provided hereunder.  As part of its periodic assessment of availability risks, Servicer shall consider the need for geographic diversification of document storage, software/data backup storage, and workplace and systems recovery, as described in the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council s Business Continuity Planning IT Examination Handbook.  At a minimum, Servicer s core processing facilities and operations will include full weekly backup and daily incremental backup to ensure minimal exposure to systems failure.  Servicer will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the continuity of operations.  Upon Purchaser s request, Servicer shall provide a copy of its business continuity and disaster recovery program summary to Purchaser and/or permit Purchaser to review Servicer s business continuity and disaster recovery plans at Servicer s location.  Servicer shall regularly, but no less than annually, test its business continuity and disaster recovery capabilities.  Servicer shall update its plans in a timely manner.  In the event of a natural or other disaster beyond Servicer s control that interrupts Servicer s performance of any services described hereunder for any period, Servicer shall respond to such disaster in a commercially reasonable time period in accordance with the procedures contained in the business continuity and disaster recovery plans in order to resume performance of such services. 
     6.6.  Cooperation in Financing Efforts.      In the event that Purchaser seeks to arrange financing to facilitate its purchase or maintenance of Eligible Loans, as described in the Purchase Agreement, Servicer will cooperate with Purchaser s efforts, including: (i) considering reasonable amendments to this Agreement (and requesting any required consents or approvals) to contemplate such financing arrangements; (ii) considering a reasonable multi-party or similar agreement with Purchaser and Purchaser s source of financing (and requesting any required consents or approvals); and (iii) considering consent to Purchaser s assignment of its obligations under this Agreement and the Purchase Agreement (and requesting any required consents or approvals) in connection with a securitization transaction. In each case, Servicer s consent to such amendments, modifications or agreements will be in the sole and absolute discretion of Servicer and, in addition, will take into account any additional costs, liabilities or operational obligations that may be requested. 
  6.7.  Notice of Transfer.   In the event that Purchaser plans, intends or agrees to sell, assign, transfer, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise dispose of its interests in Loan(s), Purchaser will only use Servicer s publicly available information to describe Servicer and its products (including the Loans) in any such solicitation.  Purchaser shall obtain Servicer s prior written consent with respect to any different or additional descriptions, information or materials concerning or relating to Servicer and its products (including the Loans) in any such solicitation.  Furthermore, Purchaser agrees that it shall provide written notice to Servicer of such transaction at least sixty (60) days prior to contacting any potential purchaser, assignee or transferee with respect to a proposed transaction. Unless otherwise agreed in writing by Servicer, Purchaser also agrees that it shall cause such purchaser, assignee or transferee to agree to be bound by the standard and customary terms of Servicer s then-current form of loan servicing agreement  .

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Servicer Event of Default only applies to Loans sold to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of a particular Addendum or Addenda, (A) this Agreement shall be terminable at the sole option of Purchaser with respect to such Loans only and (B) this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect with respect to any other Loans sold to Purchaser pursuant to the terms of any other Addendum or Addenda.
