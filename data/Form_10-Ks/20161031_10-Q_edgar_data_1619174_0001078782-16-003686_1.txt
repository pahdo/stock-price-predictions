 NOTES TO UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
 NOTE 1: BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
   
 Basis of Presentation 
   
 The unaudited interim financial statements of Moms Online, Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Regulation S-X rule 8-03. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented herein. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim financial statements related to the period are unaudited. The results for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any subsequent quarters or for the entire year ending December 31, 2016. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
   
 Reclassifications 
   
 Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
   
 NOTE 2: GOING CONCERN AND CONTINGENCIES 
   
 Going Concern 
   
 As shown in the accompanying financial statements, we have incurred losses in each year since inception and have an accumulated deficit of $827,447 as of September 30, 2016. These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. In response to these conditions, we may raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities, through an offering of debt securities or through borrowings from financial institutions or individuals. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. The company did raise $328,150 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 through the sale of 367,534 shares of its common stock, which is greater than the loss of $271,431 recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
   
 Repayment of investment from Sister Corp 
   
 There is an informal agreement between Social Quotient, Inc. ( SQI ), the company s affiliate (sister corp.) and the Company that calls for the company to give recognition to SQI for the equity contributed to the company  from inception to the future date in which the company might be engaged in a merger or change in control . The amount of consideration contingently due from the company was $95,224 and $96,650 as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This contingent liability amount can be satisfied in cash (minimum), or currently $.02 per share; debt; or equity conversion in the event of a merger or transaction in which there is a change in Control. 
   
 NOTE 3: RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS 
   
 All directors of the company are related parties. IceLounge Media, Inc.  ILMI  funded 100% of the development of the  Momscorner.com  website prior to December 31, 2013. ILMI spun off the website to the Company. All amounts due to related parties were converted to stock in 2013 by prior agreement. The stock fair value was determined to be $0.5168 per share, based on the fair values of the website and the anticipated public filing. 
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, ILMI paid certain expenses for and on behalf of the Company of $13,665 and $68,538 respectively, which were accounted for as amounts due to parent and are due on demand. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding amounts due to parent were $159,331 and $145,666, respectively. 
   
 In addition, Social Quotient Inc. paid $6,228 and $15,706 of expenses, respectively, for and in behalf of the Company, for the nine months ended September 30, 216 and 2016, respectively which were accounted for as paid in capital. Also, the Company re-paid SQI $15,000 and $0, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was accounted for as a reduction of paid-in capital.  

6 

On June 6, 2016 the Board of Directors of IMLI agreed to transfer from its own holdings of the company s common stock, 25,000 shares to a company shareholder because he was the first to invest in all three of the IMLI family of companies.  
   
 The Company licenses its technology platform from ILMI, under an Agreement which calls for an automatic 12 month renewal each year on October 1, and a monthly lease payment of $4,167. The company accrued $37,500 for platform lease expense for each of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
 WB Capital, a related party with common principal ownership, provides Merger   Acquisition and project management services to the Company as a consultant. There is no written agreement governing the relationship. The Company accrued $2,500 a month for these services. Due to the Company s lack of available cash, the amounts were not paid during either of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. Consequently the Company recorded an additional liability of $22,500 as of September 30, 2016 for a total of $52,500 as of the same date. The Company owed WB Capital $30,000 as of December 31, 2015. 
   
 Scott E. Lybbert, Acting CFO and Director, provides accounting and reporting services to the Company as a consultant. There is no written agreement governing the relationship. The Company paid Mr. Lybbert $1,000 and $6,250 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Mr. Lybbert hired support staff to ensure a more proper segregation of duties. Consequently, in addition to accruing $1,250 a month (for nine months), an additional $375 (for three months), and $208 (for an intern) has been accrued for these services. Consequently, the company recorded an additional liability of $12,708 as of September 30, 2016 for a total of $18,958 as of the same date. The Company owed Mr. Lybbert $6,250 as of December 31, 2015. 
   
 The company pays a financial services consultant, who began working for the company at the end of the first quarter of 2016. The company has accrued invoices from this consultant in the amount of $13,200 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, of which $6,800 have been paid, leaving a balance payable of $6,400 as of September 30, 2016. 
   
 NOTE 4: WEBSITE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
   
 Since inception, most of the Company s resources have been focused on creating its business model and related website. Certain costs incurred in development of our website were capitalized with a total of $86,486 allocated to our website development by December 31, 2014. The Company capitalized no cost ($0) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015. The Company began amortizing its capitalized website costs over a three year period, beginning January 1, 2015 since development had been completed. Amortization expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $21,622. Accumulated amortization as of September 30, 2016 was $50,450. 
   
 NOTE 5: EQUITY 
   
 Common stock 
   
 The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 75,000,000 shares of Common stock, par value $.001 per share, of which 4,773,446 were outstanding as of September 30, 2016. 
   
 The holders of Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share on each matter submitted to a vote at any rights and, therefore, a majority of the shares of outstanding Common Stock will be able to elect the entire board of directors and, if they do so, minority shareholders would not be able to elect any persons to the board of directors. Moms Online s bylaws provide that a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Moms Online constitutes a quorum for shareholders  meetings. 
   
 Shareholders of Moms Online have no preemptive rights to acquire additional shares of Common Stock or other securities. The Common Stock is not subject to redemption and carries no subscription or conversion rights. In the event of liquidation of Moms Online, the shares of Common Stock are entitled to share equally in corporate assets after satisfaction of all liabilities. 
   
 Holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive such dividends, as the board of directors may from time to time declare out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends. Moms Online seeks growth and expansion of its business through the reinvestment of profits, if any, and does not anticipate that we will pay dividends in the foreseeable future.  
   
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the company sold 367,534 shares of the Company s common stock for $328,150 at prices ranging from $.75 - $1.00 per share, respectively, to one existing and 27 new shareholders. 

7 

The company also recognized $9,370 of deferred stock compensation during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to recognize two quarters of a four year stock compensation agreement calling for the payment of 100,000 shares, valued at the time of agreement (October 30, 2015) at $.50 a share, over a four year period to a consultant. These shares have not been issued yet due to a yet unfulfilled vesting clause, and are accounted for as a deferred compensation component of paid in capital. The company also recognized $4,998 of deferred stock compensation during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to recognize one month of a two year stock compensation agreement calling for the payment of 40,000 shares, valued at the stated price and stock value at the time of agreement (June 1, 2016) at $.75 a share, over a two year period to a second consultant/shareholder. These shares have not been issued yet due to a yet unfulfilled vesting clause, and are accounted for as a deferred compensation component of paid in capital. 
   
 The company recognized a one-time expense of $23,438 for the issuance of 31,250 shares to M. Kevin Ghim, the company s President, for services rendered.

ITEM 2: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS AND PLAN OF OPERATIONS  
   
 The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. See  ITEM 1 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS . 
   
 Management's Discussion and Analysis: 
   
 Certain statements in this Report constitute  forward-looking statements.  Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, among others, uncertainties relating to general economic and business conditions; industry trends; changes in demand for our products and services; uncertainties relating to customer plans and commitments and the timing of orders received from customers; announcements or changes in our pricing policies or that of our competitors; unanticipated delays in the development, market acceptance or installation of our products and services; changes in government regulations; availability of management and other key personnel; availability, terms and deployment of capital; relationships with third-party equipment suppliers; and worldwide political stability and economic growth. The words  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend  and  plan  and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date the statement was made 
   
 Results of Operations 
   
 Net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $32,221, or 67% over the $48,216 net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to an increase in Selling, general and administrative costs of $32,676 or 320% due mostly to efforts to improve the look and content of the website, which led to increases in strategic planning, content management and temporary labor of $25,128, or 100%; marketing related consulting and travel costs of $4,623, or 100%, and an increase in travel expense of $3,568, or 590%.  
   
 Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $131,127, or 93 % over the $140,304 net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due primarily to the following: a) an increase in Selling, general and administrative costs of $102,907 or 355% due mostly to efforts to improve the look and content of the website, which led to increases in strategic planning, content management and temporary labor of $40,054, or 100%; marketing related consulting and printing costs of $29,994, or 100% and a one-time management expense through stock compensation of $23,437, or 100% and b) efforts to continuously improve the technical functionality of the website leading to an increase in Website development and maintenance of $33,092, or 170%.  
   
 Liquidity and Capital Resources: 
   
 At its current level of operations, the Company will need to raise additional capital during the next fiscal year. The Company has a relatively moderate amount of cash and had depended upon ILMI (its parent company) and Social Quotient (its sister company) for funding in the past. It is management s intent to continue to have the Company break away from its dependencies and to be self-sufficient. The original strategy has met with some success, as the company did raise $328,150 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 through the sale of 367,534 shares of its common stock. The company is raising capital at a higher rate than it is using cash in operations. 
   
 The Company spent and capitalized $86,486 to its website through December 30, 2014, although no costs ($0) were capitalized in either of the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 or 2015, respectively. 
   
 CURRENT PLAN OF OPERATIONS 
   
 The Company plans to sell stock to raise sufficient capital to begin marketing the website, grow its user base and website traffic in order to begin generating revenues. Additional personnel will be added and managed as they become affordable. The company will also pursue potential merger or acquisition candidates as they may present themselves 
   
 Management encourages its shareholders to communicate directly with the Company for its typical investor relations, including address changes and for general corporate information by calling or writing to the Company at its administrative offices or by posting a message to Management also encourages shareholders to keep their address current with the Company.

DISCLOSURE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS 
   
 This annual report includes forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties. Such statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking language such as  will likely result ,  may ,  are expected to ,  is anticipated ,  estimate ,  believes ,  projected , or similar words. All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this section, are forward-looking statements. Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct. The Company's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in any such forward-looking statements as a result of various risks, including, without limitation, the dependence on a single line of business; the failure to close proposed financing; rapid technological change; inability to attract and retain key personnel; the potential for significant fluctuations in operating results; the loss of a major customer; and the potential volatility of the Company's common stock. 
   
 ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
   
 The company operates minimally and has no meaningful assets subject to market risk. Therefore, this item is not applicable given the company s current operations. 
   
 ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
   
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
   
 As of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )), and management necessarily applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding management s control objectives. You should note that the design of any system of controls is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. Based upon the foregoing evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures over financial reporting were not effective. Our management identified the following material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which are indicative of many small companies with small staff: 
   
 We do not yet have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act as of September 30, 2016. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness, and 
   
 We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature, the segregation of all conflicting duties has not always been possible or economically feasible. To the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have sufficient segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 
   
 Management will seek to provide sufficient resources toward the proper mitigation of these material control weaknesses. 
   
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
   
 There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the third quarter of 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
