  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

A.    Financial Statements 
    
  Organization 
    
  On May 15, 2015, EQGP completed its IPO.  EQGP was formed in January 2015 as a Delaware limited partnership and wholly owned subsidiary of EQT Gathering Holdings, LLC (EQT Gathering Holdings), which is a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of EQT. EQGP was formed to own EQT's partnership interests in EQM, a growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership formed by EQT to own, operate, acquire and develop midstream assets in the Appalachian Basin.  EQT Midstream Services, LLC (EQM General Partner) is a direct wholly owned subsidiary of EQGP and is EQM's general partner.  EQT GP Services, LLC (EQGP General Partner) is a wholly owned subsidiary of EQT and is EQGP's general partner. 
    
  For accounting purposes, the historical financial statements of EQGP for the time periods prior to the completion of the IPO (the Predecessor) include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of EQM. Prior to the IPO, EQT directly held partnership interests in EQM through wholly owned subsidiaries, including the EQM General Partner. Prior to the closing of the IPO, those subsidiaries merged with and into EQGP and EQT contributed   100%   of the outstanding limited liability company interests in the EQM General Partner to EQGP.   
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP for interim financial information and with the requirements of Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, these unaudited consolidated financial statements include all adjustments (consisting of only normal recurring adjustments, unless otherwise disclosed in this Form 10-Q) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of EQGP as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the results of its operations for the   three   and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   and its cash flows and equity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Certain previously reported amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The balance sheet at   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. 
    
  EQGP has no independent operations and EQGP's only cash-generating assets consist of its partnership interests in EQM.  EQGP s financial statements differ from those of EQM primarily as a result of noncontrolling interest ownership attributable to the publicly held limited partner interests in EQM and additional expenses incurred by EQGP which include selling, general and administrative expenses, interest expense net of interest income and incremental income tax expense for the period prior to the EQGP IPO.  Because the EQM General Partner is a wholly owned subsidiary of EQGP and controls EQM through its general partner interest, EQM is consolidated by EQGP. 
    
  NWV Gathering was a business and the NWV Gathering Acquisition was a transaction between entities under common control; therefore, EQM recorded the assets and liabilities of NWV Gathering at their carrying amounts to EQT on the date of the transaction. The difference between EQT s net carrying amount and the total consideration paid to EQT was recorded as a capital transaction with EQT, which resulted in a reduction in partners  capital. EQM recast its consolidated financial statements to retrospectively reflect the NWV Gathering Acquisition as if the business was owned for all periods presented; however, the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred if EQM had owned it during the periods reported.  
    
  Due to the seasonal nature of EQM s utility customer contracts, the interim statements for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in EQGP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   as well as  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained therein.  
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Standards 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The standard requires an entity to recognize revenue in a manner that depicts the transfer of goods or services to customers at 
  
   8 

     Table of Contents  

an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 will supersede most of the existing revenue recognition requirements in GAAP when it becomes effective and is required to be adopted using one of two retrospective application methods. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Deferral of the Effective Date which approved a one year deferral of ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application of these ASUs is permitted as of the original effective date for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. EQGP expects to adopt the ASUs using the modified retrospective method of adoption on January 1, 2018 and is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation  . The standard changes the analysis that a reporting entity 
  must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. EQGP adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2016 which had no significant impact on reported results. See Note J for additional disclosures required as a result of the adoption of this standard. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments-Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   The changes primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This standard will eliminate the cost method of accounting for equity investments. The ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, with early adoption of certain provisions permitted. EQGP is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  . The ASU requires, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Lessees and lessors must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The ASU will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. EQGP is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.   This ASU amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, this ASU eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. EQGP is currently evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  .  This ASU addresses the presentation and classification of eight specific cash flow issues. The amendments in the ASU will be effective for public business entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period, with early adoption permitted. EQGP does not anticipate that this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements and related disclosures. 

B.    Acquisitions       
    
  NWV Gathering Acquisition 
    
  On March 17, 2015, EQT contributed NWV Gathering to EQM Gathering. EQM paid total consideration of approximately   $925.7 million   to EQT, consisting of approximately   $873.2 million   in cash,   511,973   EQM common units and   178,816   EQM general partner units.

Preferred Interest Acquisition 
    
  On April 15, 2015, pursuant to the NWV Gathering Acquisition contribution and sale agreement, EQM acquired the Preferred Interest in EES from EQT for approximately   $124.3 million  . EES generates revenue from services provided to a local distribution company. See Note F. 

C.     Equity 
    
  Holdings of EQGP Equity 
    
  On May 15, 2015, EQGP completed its IPO of   26,450,000   common units representing limited partner interests.  All of the common units sold in the IPO were sold by EQT Gathering Holdings.  EQGP did not receive any proceeds from, or incur any expenses in connection with, the completion of the IPO. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQT indirectly held   239,715,000   EQGP common units, representing a   90.1%   limited partner interest, and the entire non-economic general partner interest in EQGP, while the public held   26,450,000   EQGP common units, representing a   9.9%   limited partner interest in EQGP.  
    
  Net Income Per Limited Partner Unit 
    
  Net income attributable to periods prior to the closing of EQGP's IPO is attributable to subsidiaries of EQT and has been excluded from the limited partners' interest in net income. The weighted average phantom unit awards included in the calculations of both basic and diluted weighted average limited partner units outstanding was   11,337   and   2,912   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   9,855   and   2,672   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
    
  Holdings of EQM Equity 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQGP and its subsidiaries owned   21,811,643   EQM common units, representing a   26.6%   limited partner interest,   1,443,015   EQM general partner units, representing the   1.8%   general partner interest, and all of the incentive distribution rights (IDRs) in EQM. As of   September 30, 2016  , the public held   58,770,115   EQM common units, representing a   71.6%   limited partner interest in EQM. 
    
  The following table summarizes EQM's common, subordinated and general partner units issued from January 1,   2015   through   September 30, 2016  .    

In February   2016  , EQM issued   19,796   common units under the 2014 EQM Value Driver Award (2014 EQM VDA) and   92,472   common units under the EQM Total Return Program, which were compensation programs for EQT employees performing work for EQM. The awards were granted in January 2014 and July 2012, respectively.

During the second quarter of 2016, EQM issued   2,949,309   common units at an average price per unit of   $74.42   under the   $750 million   ATM Program. EQM received net proceeds of approximately   $217.1 million   after deducting commissions of approximately   $2.2 million   and other offering expenses of approximately   $0.2 million  . EQM used the net proceeds for general partnership purposes. EQGP recorded a   $44.9 million   increase to common units and a corresponding decrease in noncontrolling interest of EQM as a result of the EQM common units issued under the   $750 million   ATM Program during the second quarter.  

D.    Financial Information by Business Segment

EQGP and EQM each have an omnibus agreement with EQT.  Pursuant to the omnibus agreements, EQT performs centralized corporate, general and administrative services for EQGP and EQM. In exchange, EQGP and EQM reimburse EQT for the expenses incurred in providing these services, including direct and indirect costs and expenses attributable to EQT's long-term incentive programs.     Pursuant to an operation and management services agreement, EQT Gathering, LLC (EQT Gathering), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQT, provides EQM s pipelines and storage facilities with certain operational and management services.  EQM reimburses EQT Gathering for such services pursuant to the terms of the omnibus agreement.  The expenses for which EQGP and EQM reimburse EQT and its subsidiaries may not necessarily reflect the actual expenses that EQGP and EQM would incur on a stand-alone basis and EQGP and EQM are unable to estimate what those expenses would be on a stand-alone basis. See also Note B, Note C, Note F, Note G and Note L for further discussion of related party transactions. 
    
  EQT terminated the EQT Corporation Retirement Plan for Employees (the Retirement Plan) effective December 31, 2014. On March 2, 2016, the IRS issued a favorable determination letter for the termination of the Retirement Plan. On June 28, 2016, EQT purchased annuities from and transferred the Retirement Plan assets and liabilities to American General Life Insurance Company. In the third quarter of 2016, EQM reimbursed EQT approximately   $5.2 million   for its proportionate share of such funding related to retirees of Equitrans, L.P. (Equitrans), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of EQM and the owner of EQM's FERC-regulated transmission, storage and gathering system. The settlement charge is expected to be recoverable in FERC approved rates and thus was recorded as a regulatory asset that will be amortized for rate recovery purposes over a period of   16   years. 

F.    Investments in Unconsolidated Entities 
    
  MVP Joint Venture 
    
  The MVP Joint Venture plans to construct the Mountain Valley Pipeline (MVP), an estimated   300  -mile natural gas interstate pipeline spanning from northern West Virginia to southern Virginia. EQM is the operator of the MVP and owned a   45.5%   interest in the MVP Joint Venture as of   September 30, 2016  . The MVP Joint Venture has been determined to be a variable interest entity because the MVP Joint Venture has insufficient equity to finance its activities during the construction stage of the project. EQM is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have the power to direct the activities of the MVP Joint Venture that most significantly impact its economic performance. Certain business decisions require the approval of owners holding more than a 66 2/3% interest in the MVP Joint Venture and no one member owns more than a 66 2/3% interest. EQM accounted for the MVP Interest as an equity method investment as EQM has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the MVP Joint Venture.  
    
  The value of the equity method investment recorded on the consolidated balance sheets was approximately   $160.3 million   and   $77.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. On   October 17, 2016  , MVP Holdco paid capital contributions of   $13.1 million   to the MVP Joint Venture. The capital contribution payable has been reflected on the consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   with a corresponding increase to EQM's investment in the MVP Joint Venture.  
    
  Equity income related to EQM's portion of the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on construction of the MVP is reported in other income in the statements of consolidated operations and was   $2.7 million   and   $0.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $6.1 million   and   $1.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  On January 21, 2016, an affiliate of Consolidated Edison, Inc. (ConEd) acquired a   12.5%   interest in the MVP Joint Venture,   8.5%   of which was purchased from EQM. EQM received a cash payment of approximately   $12.5 million  , which represented EQM's proportional capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture through the date of the transaction. ConEd has the right to terminate its purchase of the interest in the MVP Joint Venture and be reimbursed for the purchase price and all capital contributions it makes to the MVP Joint Venture for a period ending no later than December 31, 2016. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM had issued a   $91 million   performance guarantee in favor of the MVP Joint Venture to provide performance assurances for MVP Holdco's obligations to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the MVP. Upon the FERC s initial release to begin construction of the MVP, EQM's guarantee will terminate and EQM will be obligated 
  
   12 

     Table of Contents  

to issue a new guarantee in an amount equal to   33%   of MVP Holdco s remaining obligations to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture in connection with the then remaining construction budget, less, subject to certain limits, any credit assurances issued by any affiliate of EQM under such affiliate's precedent agreement with the MVP Joint Venture. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM's maximum financial statement exposure related to the MVP Joint Venture was approximately   $251 million  , which included the investment balance on the consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and amounts which could have become due under the performance guarantee as of that date. 
    
  Preferred Interest 
    
  EES was determined to be a variable interest entity because it has insufficient equity to finance its activities. EQM is not the primary beneficiary because it does not have the power to direct the activities of EES that most significantly impact its economic performance. The Preferred Interest in EES was determined to be a cost method investment as EQM does not have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of EES.  
    
  During the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , EQM received cash distributions from EES of   $2.8 million   and   $8.3 million  , respectively, which were included in other income in the accompanying statements of consolidated operations. EQM expects to receive cash distributions of approximately   $11 million   during the year ended   December 31, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of EQM's Preferred Interest in EES was approximately   $150 million   and   $140 million  , respectively, and the carrying value of EQM's Preferred Interest in EES was   $124.3 million   at both dates. The fair value of EQM's Preferred Interest in EES is a Level 3 fair value measurement. As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying value represents EQM's maximum exposure to loss. 
    
  Concurrent with the October 2016 Acquisition, discussed in Note L, the operating agreement of EES was amended to include mandatory redemption of the Preferred Interest at the end of the preference period which is expected to be December 31, 2034. As a result of this amendment, EQM's investment in EES converted to a note receivable effective October 13, 2016.  This conversion does not impact the carrying value of this instrument; however, future distributions from EES will be recorded partly as interest income and partly as a reduction in the note receivable.  

G.     Credit Facility Borrowings 
    
  EQGP Working Capital Facility 
    
  On May 15, 2015, in connection with the closing of EQGP's IPO, EQGP entered into a Working Capital Loan Agreement with EQT (the Working Capital Facility).  The Working Capital Facility provides for interest bearing loans of up to   $50 million   outstanding at any one time and matures on the earlier of February 18, 2019 or at least   90   days after EQT gives notice of termination.   
    
  EQGP had approximately   $0.1 million   of borrowings outstanding under the Working Capital Facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , which is included in the related party balances on the consolidated balance sheets. The maximum amount of EQGP s outstanding credit facility borrowings was approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million   at any time during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $0.2 million   and   $0.7 million   at any time during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The average daily balance of EQGP s outstanding credit facility borrowings was approximately   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   $0.5 million   and   $0.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Interest was incurred at a weighted average annual interest rate of approximately   2.0%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and approximately   1.7%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  EQM Credit Facilities 
    
  EQM has a   $750   million credit facility that expires in February 2019 (the   $750   Million Facility). The credit facility is available to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures, to purchase assets, to pay distributions, to repurchase units and for general partnership purposes. 
    
  EQM had   $91 million   of borrowings outstanding on its   $750   Million Facility as of   September 30, 2016   and had   $299 million   outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . The maximum amount of EQM s outstanding credit facility borrowings was   $91 million   and   $404 million   at any time during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $299 million   and   $404 million   at any time during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The average daily balance 
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

of credit facility borrowings outstanding was approximately   $34 million   and   $357 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and approximately   $67 million   and   $241 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Interest was incurred on the credit facility borrowings at a weighted average annual interest rate of approximately   2.0%   and   1.9%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and approximately   1.7%   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  On October 26, 2016, EQM entered into a   $500 million  ,   364  -day, uncommitted revolving loan agreement with EQT (the   364  -Day Facility). The   364  -Day Facility will mature on October 25, 2017 and will automatically renew for successive   364  -day periods unless EQT delivers a non-renewal notice at least   60   days prior to the then current maturity date. EQM may terminate the   364  -Day Facility at any time by repaying in full the unpaid principal amount of all loans together with interest thereon. The   364  -Day Facility is available for general partnership purposes and does not contain any covenants other than the obligation to pay accrued interest on outstanding borrowings. Interest will accrue on any outstanding borrowings at an interest rate equal to the rate then applicable to similar loans under the   $750   Million Facility, or a successor revolving credit facility, less the sum of (i) the then applicable commitment fee under the   $750   Million Facility and (ii) 10 basis points. 

H.    Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, amounts due to/from related parties and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments; these are considered Level 1 fair values. The carrying value of credit facility borrowings approximates fair value as the interest rates are based on prevailing market rates; this is considered a Level 1 fair value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the estimated fair value of EQM's long-term debt was approximately   $493 million   and   $414 million  , respectively, and the carrying value of EQM's long-term debt was approximately   $494 million   and   $493 million  , respectively. The fair value of EQM's long-term debt is a Level 2 fair value measurement. See Note F for the fair value of EQM's Preferred Interest in EES. 

I.     Income Taxes 
    
  The Predecessor's financial statements for the period prior to EQGP's IPO include U.S. federal and state income tax as its income was included as part of EQT's consolidated return for federal and state income tax purposes. The consolidated federal income tax was allocated among the group s members on a separate return basis with tax credits allocated to the members generating the credits. Federal tax obligations of all subsidiary companies were settled through EQT. As a result of its limited partnership structure following EQGP's IPO, EQGP is not subject to federal and state income taxes. Subsequent to May 15, 2015, for federal and state income tax purposes, all income, expenses, gains, losses and tax credits generated by EQGP flow through to the unitholders; accordingly, EQGP does not record a provision for income taxes. In the second quarter of 2015, approximately   $164.6 million   of net current and deferred income taxes, including those associated with the operations of NWV Gathering, were eliminated through equity related to EQGP's IPO.  
    
  For the period prior to EQGP's IPO, EQGP estimated an annual effective tax rate based on projected results for the year and applied this rate to income before taxes to calculate income tax expense. All of EQM's earnings were included in EQGP's net income. However, EQGP was not required to record income tax expense with respect to the portion of EQM's earnings allocated to its noncontrolling public limited partners, which reduced EQGP's effective tax rate.  
    
  As discussed in Note B, EQM completed the NWV Gathering Acquisition on March 17, 2015, which was a transaction between entities under common control. Prior to this transaction, the income from NWV Gathering was included in EQT s consolidated federal tax return; therefore, the NWV Gathering operations were subject to income taxes. Accordingly, the income tax effects associated with the operations of NWV Gathering prior to the NWV Gathering Acquisition were reflected in EQM s consolidated financial statements. 

J.     Consolidated Variable Interest Entity 
    
  EQGP adopted ASU No. 2015-02,   Consolidation,   in the first quarter of 2016 and, as a result, EQGP determined EQM to be a variable interest entity. Through EQGP's ownership and control of the EQM General Partner, EQGP has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact EQM's economic performance. In addition, through EQGP's general partner interest, IDRs and limited partner interest in EQM, EQGP has the obligation to absorb EQM's losses and the right to receive benefits from EQM in accordance with its general partner and limited partner ownership percentages and IDRs. Therefore, EQGP has a controlling financial interest in EQM, is the primary beneficiary of EQM and consolidates EQM.  
    
  EQGP's only cash-generating assets consist of its partnership interests in EQM. As a result, EQGP's     results of operations do not differ materially from the results of operations of EQM. The risks associated with EQM's operations are discussed in EQGP's

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. See further discussion of the impact that EQGP's involvement in EQM has on EQGP's financial position, results of operations and cash flows included in EQGP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , including the section captioned "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."  For a discussion of related party transactions, see Note 5 of Item 8 in EQGP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and Note B, Note C, Note F, Note G and Note L contained herein.

K.     Distributions 
    
  EQM and EQGP declared the following cash distributions to their respective unitholders for the periods presented:   

(2) 
    On   October 25, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the EQM General Partner declared a cash distribution to EQM's unitholders for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.815   per common unit. The cash distribution will be paid on   November 14, 2016   to unitholders of record, including EQGP, at the close of business on   November 4, 2016  . Based on the   80,581,758   EQM common units outstanding on   October 27, 2016  , cash distributions to EQGP will be approximately   $44.3 million   consisting of:   $17.8 million   related to its limited partner interest,   $1.6 million   related to its general partner interest and   $24.9 million   related to its IDRs in EQM. These distribution amounts to EQGP are subject to change if EQM issues additional common units on or prior to the record date for the   third   quarter 2016 distribution. 
       
  On   October 25, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the EQGP General Partner declared a cash distribution to EQGP s unitholders for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.165   per common unit, or approximately   $43.9 million  . The distribution will be paid on   November 22, 2016   to unitholders of record at the close of business on   November 4, 2016  .  

L.   
    Subsequent Events  
       
  On October 13, 2016, EQM entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with EQT and certain of EQT's affiliates pursuant to which EQM acquired from EQT (i)   100%   of the outstanding limited liability company interests of Allegheny Valley Connector, LLC (AVC) and Rager Mountain Storage Company LLC (Rager) and (ii) certain gathering assets located in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia (the Gathering Assets) (collectively, the October 2016 Acquisition). The closing of the October 2016 Acquisition occurred on October 13, 2016 and was effective as of October 1, 2016. The aggregate consideration paid by EQM to EQT in connection with the October 2016 Acquisition was   $275 million  , which was funded with borrowings under the   $750   Million Facility.   
    
  AVC, Rager and the Gathering Assets were businesses and the October 2016 Acquisition was a transaction between entities under common control. Therefore, EQM will record the acquired assets and liabilities at their carrying amounts to EQT on the effective date of the transaction, and the difference between EQT s net carrying amount and the total consideration paid to EQT will be recorded as a capital transaction with EQT. EQM will recast its consolidated financial statements to reflect the October 2016 Acquisition as if the assets were owned for all periods presented beginning with its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.

  Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  EQGP, which completed its IPO on May 15, 2015, is a Delaware limited partnership formed in January 2015 to own EQT's partnership interests in EQM. References in the following discussion to EQGP, when used for periods prior to the completion of the IPO, refer to EQGP's Predecessor which includes the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the EQM General Partner and EQT Midstream Investments, LLC (EQM LP).  Prior to the IPO, the EQM General Partner and EQM LP were wholly owned subsidiaries of EQT and directly held EQT's partnership interests in EQM. EQM's consolidated financial statements for all periods presented include the historical results of NWV Gathering, which was acquired on March 17, 2015, as NWV Gathering was a business and the transaction was between entities under common control. You should read the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, EQM reported net income of $126.6 million compared to $94.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase primarily resulted from higher revenues from both gathering and transmission and storage, which were primarily driven by affiliate production development in the Marcellus Shale, higher other income and lower interest expense.  These items were partly offset by an increase in operating expenses, consistent with the growth of the business.  
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, EQM reported net income of $380.4 million compared to $280.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase resulted from higher revenues from both gathering and transmission and storage which were primarily driven by affiliate production development in the Marcellus Shale, higher other income and lower interest and income tax expense. These items were partly offset by an increase in operating expenses consistent with the growth of the business. 
    
  EQM declared a cash distribution to EQM unitholders of   $0.815   per unit on   October 25, 2016  , which was   4%   higher than the second quarter   2016   distribution of   $0.78   per unit and   21%   higher than the   third quarter   2015 distribution of   $0.675   per unit. 
    
  EQGP declared a cash distribution to EQGP unitholders of   $0.165   per unit on   October 25, 2016  , which was   10%   higher than the second quarter   2016   distribution of   $0.15   per unit and   59%   higher than the   third quarter   2015 distribution of   $0.104   per unit. 
    
  Items Affecting the Comparability of EQGP's Financial Results to Those of EQM 
    
  The following is a summary of the primary items which may result in differences between EQGP's and EQM's results of operations: 
    
  Reconciliation of Net Income Attributable to EQM to Net Income Attributable to EQGP.  
    
  The differences between EQM net income as reported in EQM's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and net income attributable to EQGP for the same periods are:   

Noncontrolling Interests.   The common units in EQM not held by EQGP are reflected as noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements. These amounts will fluctuate based on EQM's net income and future changes in the public ownership percentage of EQM. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests of EQM increased by   $17.2 million   and   $63.8 million   for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, due to higher EQM net income as well as additional noncontrolling interests outstanding as a result of EQM equity offerings during the periods. 
    
  Income Taxes.   EQGP's Predecessor was included in EQT's consolidated income tax return for federal and state tax purposes for the period prior to the EQGP IPO.  As a result, in addition to EQM's historic income tax provision, the accompanying consolidated financial statements also include the income taxes incurred by the Predecessor computed on a separate return basis. Subsequent to the IPO, EQGP is a limited partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes and is not subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes.

     Table of Contents  

Additional Expenses.   Subsequent to its IPO,     EQGP incurs selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of being a publicly traded partnership.  These expenses are separate from and in addition to similar costs incurred by EQM. These expenses include expenses allocated from EQT for compensation and centralized general and administrative services, and independent director compensation, auditing, legal and regulatory costs. EQGP also incurs interest expense under its Working Capital Facility and earns interest income on cash on hand.  
    
  Business Segment Results of Operations 
    
  Operating segments are revenue-producing components of the enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and is subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources. Other income and interest are managed on a consolidated basis. EQGP has presented each segment's operating income and various operational measures in the following sections. Management believes that the presentation of this information provides useful information to management and investors regarding the financial condition, results of operations and trends of segments. EQGP's two segments are the same as those of EQM as EQGP does not have any operating activities separate from those of EQM. EQGP has reconciled each segment's operating income to EQGP's consolidated operating income and net income in Note D to the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  GATHERING 
    
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

(1)    Includes fees on volumes gathered in excess of firm contracted capacity. 
    
  (2)    Includes volumes gathered under interruptible contracts and volumes gathered in excess of firm contracted capacity. 
    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Gathering revenues increased by $14.5 million primarily as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes gathered for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale. EQM increased firm reservation fee revenues as a result of affiliates and third parties contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, which resulted in increased firm gathering capacity of approximately 300 MMcf per day following the completion of the NWV Gathering and Jupiter expansion projects in the fourth quarter of 2015. The decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts was primarily due to these additional contracts for firm capacity.

Operating expenses increased by $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from EQT. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from additional assets placed in-service including those associated with the NWV Gathering and Jupiter expansion projects. 
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Gathering revenues increased by $50.2 million primarily as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes gathered for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale. EQM increased firm reservation fee revenues as a result of affiliates and third parties contracting for additional capacity under firm contracts, which resulted in a decrease in usage fees under interruptible contracts. 
    
  Operating expenses increased by $9.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expense increased primarily as a result of higher allocations and personnel costs from EQT. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense resulted from additional assets placed in-service including those associated with the NWV Gathering and Jupiter expansion projects. 
    
  TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE 
    
  Operating revenues and operating expenses related to the Allegheny Valley Connector (AVC) facilities did not have an impact on EQM's adjusted EBITDA or distributable cash flow, as the excess of the AVC revenues over operating and maintenance and selling, general and administrative expenses were paid to EQT as the monthly lease payment. All revenues related to the AVC facilities are from third parties. 
    
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

(1)    Includes commodity charges and fees on volumes transported in excess of firm contracted capacity. 
    
  (2)    Includes volumes transported under interruptible contracts and volumes transported in excess of firm contracted capacity.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Transmission and storage revenues increased by $7.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This was driven by higher usage fees under firm contracts as a result of an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the Marcellus Shale, partly offset by lower usage fees from third party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This reduction did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues. Firm reservation fee revenues increased as a result of higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year. Usage fees under interruptible contracts for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes transported on an interruptible basis.  
    
  Operating expenses increased by $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of higher depreciation and amortization expense primarily related to the increased investment in the AVC facilities. 
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Transmission and storage revenues increased by $25.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Higher usage fees under firm contracts were driven by an increase in affiliate volumes in excess of firm capacity associated with increased production development in the Marcellus Shale, partly offset by lower usage fees from third party producers which is reflected in reduced firm capacity reservation throughput for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These volumes also decreased as a result of warmer weather during the first quarter of 2016. This decrease in transported volumes did not have a significant impact on firm reservation fee revenues. Firm reservation fee revenues increased as a result of higher contractual rates on existing contracts in the current year. Usage fees under interruptible contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased as a result of higher affiliate and third party volumes transported on an interruptible basis.  
    
  Operating expenses increased by $4.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of higher depreciation and amortization expense related to the increased investment in the AVC facilities and additional assets placed in-service. 
    
  Other Income Statement Items 
    
  Other income increased by $10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily driven by increased AFUDC - equity of $5.7 million mainly attributable to increased spending on the OVC project, distributions received from EES of $2.8 million which began in January 2016 and higher equity income related to EQM's portion of the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP. Other income increased by $25.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily driven by increased AFUDC - equity of $11.5 million mainly attributable to increased spending on the OVC project, distributions received from EES of $8.3 million and higher equity income related to EQM's portion of the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP. 
    
  Interest expense decreased by $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily driven by higher capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt associated with increased spending on regulated projects of $1.6 million, decreased interest expense of $1.3 million on lower credit facility borrowings and lower capital lease interest expense. Interest expense decreased by $7.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily driven by higher capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt of $3.2 million associated with increased spending on regulated projects, lower capital lease interest expense of $2.1 million and decreased interest expense on lower credit facility borrowings. As a result of the OVC beginning service on October 1, 2016, AFUDC - debt will substantially decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
    
  Concurrent with the October 2016 Acquisition, discussed in Note L, the operating agreement of EES was amended to include mandatory redemption of the Preferred Interest at the end of the preference period which is expected to be December 31, 2034. As a result of this amendment, EQM's investment in EES converted to a note receivable effective October 13, 2016. This conversion does not impact the carrying value of this instrument, however, future distributions from EES will be recorded partly as interest income and partly as a reduction in the note receivable. This change will decrease the amount of other income recognized in future periods and increase interest income. It will have no impact on expected cash flows during the preference period.

EQGP and EQM are not subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. As previously noted, the NWV Gathering Acquisition, which closed on March 17, 2015, was a transaction between entities under common control for which the consolidated financial statements of EQM were retrospectively recast to reflect the combined entities. Accordingly, the income tax effects associated with NWV Gathering's operations prior to the NWV Gathering Acquisition were reflected in the consolidated financial statements as NWV Gathering was previously part of EQT s consolidated federal tax return. EQGP's Predecessor was also included in EQT's consolidated income tax return for federal and state tax purposes. As a result, in addition to EQM's historic income tax provision, the accompanying consolidated financial statements also include the income taxes incurred by the EQGP Predecessor computed on a separate return basis for the period prior to EQGP's IPO. 
    
  See  Investing Activities  and  Capital Requirements  in the  Capital Resources and Liquidity  section below for a discussion of capital expenditures. 

EQM's Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  EQM defines adjusted EBITDA as EQM's net income plus interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, income tax expense (if applicable) and non-cash long-term compensation expense less equity income, AFUDC - equity, capital lease payments and NWV Gathering adjusted EBITDA prior to the NWV Gathering Acquisition. EQM defines distributable cash flow as adjusted EBITDA less interest expense excluding capital lease interest, capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt, and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures net of expected reimbursements.  Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow are non-GAAP supplemental financial measures that management and external users of EQM s consolidated financial statements, such as industry analysts, investors, lenders and rating agencies, use to assess: 

EQM s operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry without regard to historical cost basis or, in the case of adjusted EBITDA, financing methods; 
                
    the ability of EQM's assets to generate sufficient cash flow to make distributions to EQM's unitholders; 
                
    EQM's ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures; and 
                
    the viability of acquisitions and other capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities. 
       
  EQM believes that adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow provide useful information to investors in assessing its financial condition and results of operations. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some, but not all, items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities. Additionally, because adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may be defined differently by other companies in its industry, EQM s adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing the utility of the measures. Distributable cash flow should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that EQM has available for distributions from operating surplus or that EQM plans to distribute.

Reconciliation of EQM Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the EQM non-GAAP financial measures adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow with the most directly comparable EQM GAAP financial measures of net income and net cash provided by operating activities as derived from EQM's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended   September 30  , 2016 and   June 30  , 2016.

    Reflects capital lease payments due under the lease. These lease payments are generally made monthly on a one month lag. 
       
           (2) 
    Adjusted EBITDA attributable to NWV Gathering prior to acquisition for the periods presented was excluded from EQM s adjusted EBITDA calculations as these amounts were generated by NWV Gathering prior to EQM s acquisition; therefore, they were not amounts that could have been distributed to EQM s unitholders. Adjusted EBITDA attributable to NWV Gathering for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was calculated as net income of $11.1 million plus depreciation and amortization expense of $2.0 million plus income tax expense of $6.7 million.

    As a result of the increased significance of capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt in 2016, this line item was added as an adjustment to the calculation of distributable cash flow for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Had distributable cash flow been calculated on a consistent basis, it would have been $1.5 million and $3.1 million lower for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, than the numbers presented herein. 
       
           (4) 
    Ongoing maintenance capital expenditures, net of expected reimbursements excludes ongoing maintenance that EQM expects to be reimbursed or that was reimbursed by EQT under the terms of EQM's omnibus agreement of $0.4 million and $5.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $0.6 million and $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Additionally, it excludes ongoing maintenance attributable to NWV Gathering prior to acquisition of $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
       
  See "Executive Overview" above for a discussion of EQM's net income, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted EBITDA. EQM's adjusted EBITDA increased by $22.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and $95.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily as a result of higher operating income on increased revenues driven by production development in the Marcellus Shale, the NWV Gathering Acquisition, which resulted in EBITDA subsequent to the transaction being reflected in adjusted EBITDA, and distributions from EES.  
    
  EQM's net cash provided by operating activities, the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow, increased by $50.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as discussed in the  Capital Resources and Liquidity" section below. Distributable cash flow increased by $23.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 and $93.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 mainly attributable to the increase in adjusted EBITDA. 

Outlook 
    
  EQGP's principal business objective is to increase the quarterly cash distribution it pays to its unitholders over time through its ownership interests in EQM. EQM's principal business objective is to increase the quarterly cash distributions that it pays to its unitholders over time while ensuring the ongoing growth of its business. EQM believes that it is well positioned to achieve growth based on the combination of its relationship with EQT and its strategically located assets, which cover portions of the Marcellus and Utica Shales that lack substantial natural gas pipeline infrastructure. EQM believes it has a competitive advantage in pursuing economically attractive organic expansion projects in its areas of operations, which EQM believes will be a key driver of growth in the future. EQM is also currently pursuing organic growth projects that are expected to provide access to markets in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast regions. Additionally, EQM may pursue asset acquisitions from third parties or, if EQT were to purchase assets or companies that contain midstream assets, EQT may make those assets available to EQM.  Should EQT choose to pursue midstream asset sales, it is under no contractual obligation to offer the assets to EQM. 
    
  EQM expects that the following expansion projects will allow it to capitalize on drilling activity by EQT and third party producers: 

Ohio Valley Connector  . The OVC, which began service on October 1, 2016, is a 37-mile pipeline that extends EQM's transmission and storage system from northern West Virginia to Clarington, Ohio, at which point it interconnects with the Rockies Express Pipeline and may interconnect with other pipelines and liquidity points. The OVC will provide approximately 850 BBtu per day of transmission capacity with an aggregate compression of approximately 38,000 horsepower at an estimated cost of $360 million, excluding AFUDC, of which $220 million is expected to be spent in 2016. EQT has entered into a 20-year transportation service agreement with EQM for a total of 650 BBtu per day of firm transmission capacity on the OVC. 

Range Resources Header Pipeline Project  . EQM is constructing a natural gas header pipeline for a subsidiary of Range Resources Corporation (Range Resources) in southwestern Pennsylvania to support Marcellus development. The pipeline is expected to cost approximately $250 million and is contracted to provide 600 MMcf per day of firm capacity backed by a ten-year firm capacity reservation commitment. EQM plans to complete the project in two phases. On October 1, 2016, phase one was placed into service providing 75 MMcf per day of firm capacity. Phase two is expected to be completed during the first half of 2017. EQM expects to invest approximately $180 million on the project in 2016. 

Gathering Expansion Projects  . EQM expects to invest a total of approximately $370 million, of which approximately $90 million is expected to be spent during 2016, related to expansion in the NWV Gathering development area. These expenditures are part of a fully subscribed expansion project expected to raise total firm gathering capacity in the NWV

     Table of Contents  

Gathering development area to 640 MMcf per day by mid-year 2017. EQM also plans to invest approximately $20 million in the Jupiter development area to install a gathering pipeline that will extend the gathering system to include additional EQT Production development areas in Greene County, Pennsylvania. As described in Note L, EQM acquired certain gathering assets located in southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia from EQT as part of the October 2016 Acquisition. EQM expects to invest approximately $105 million over the next several years to complete planned expansion projects including the installation of approximately 20 miles of pipeline and four compressor units. EQM expects to spend approximately $5 million on this expansion project during the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Equitrans and AVC Expansion Projects  . EQM is evaluating several multi-year transmission capacity expansion projects to support production growth in the Marcellus and Utica Shales that could total an additional 1.5 Bcf per day of capacity by year-end 2018. The projects may include additional compression, pipeline looping and new header pipelines. EQM expects to spend approximately $20 million on these expansion projects during 2016. As described in Note L, EQM acquired AVC from EQT as part of the October 2016 Acquisition. EQM expects to invest approximately $50 million in AVC related growth projects during the remainder of 2016 and 2017, of which approximately $25 million is expected to be spent during the fourth quarter of 2016.  

Mountain Valley Pipeline  . The MVP Joint Venture is a joint venture with affiliates of each of NextEra Energy, Inc., Consolidated Edison, Inc., WGL Holdings, Inc. and RGC Resources, Inc. EQM is the operator of the MVP and owned a 45.5% interest in the MVP Joint Venture as of October 27, 2016. The 42 inch diameter MVP has a targeted initial capacity of 2.0 Bcf per day and is estimated to span 300-miles extending from EQM's existing transmission and storage system in Wetzel County, West Virginia to Pittsylvania County, Virginia. As currently designed, the MVP is estimated to cost a total of $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion, excluding AFUDC, with EQM funding its proportionate share through capital contributions made to the joint venture. In 2016, EQM expects to provide capital contributions of approximately $100 million to the MVP Joint Venture, primarily in support of material orders, environmental and land assessments and engineering design work. Expenditures are expected to increase substantially as construction commences, with the bulk of the expenditures expected to be made in 2017 and 2018. The MVP Joint Venture has secured a total of 2.0 Bcf per day of 20-year firm capacity commitments, including a 1.29 Bcf per day firm capacity commitment by EQT, and is currently in negotiation with additional shippers who have expressed interest in the MVP project. The MVP Joint Venture submitted the MVP certificate application to the FERC in October 2015, and the FERC issued the Notice of Schedule for Environmental Review (NOS) and the Draft Environmental Impact Statement on June 28, 2016 and September 16, 2016, respectively. Based on the schedule provided in the NOS, the MVP Joint Venture anticipates receiving the certificate in mid-2017. The pipeline is targeted to be placed in-service during the fourth quarter of 2018. 
       
  See further discussion of capital expenditures in the  EQM Capital Requirements  section below.  
    
  Commodity Prices  
    
  EQM s business is dependent on the continued availability of natural gas production and reserves in its areas of operation. Low prices for natural gas, including those resulting from regional basis differentials, could adversely affect development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by EQM s pipeline and storage assets. Appalachian Basin market prices for natural gas were depressed throughout 2015 and the first nine months of 2016. Lower regional natural gas prices could cause producers to determine in the future that drilling activities in areas outside of EQM s current areas of operation are strategically more attractive to them. In response to the depressed commodity price environment, a number of large natural gas producers announced their intention to re-evaluate and/or reduce their drilling programs in certain areas, including the Appalachian Basin. EQT's 2016 capital expenditure forecast is significantly lower than EQT's 2015 capital expenditures. EQT, or third party customers on EQM's systems, may reduce capital spending in the future based on commodity prices or other factors. Unless EQM is successful in attracting and retaining unaffiliated third party customers, which accounted for 49% of transmission and storage revenues and 4% of gathering revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, its ability to maintain or increase the capacity subscribed and volumes transported under service arrangements on its transmission and storage system as well as the volumes gathered on its gathering systems will be dependent on receiving consistent or increasing commitments from EQT. While EQT has dedicated acreage to EQM, and has entered into long-term firm transmission and gathering contracts on EQM's systems, EQT may determine in the future that drilling in areas outside of EQM's current areas of operations is strategically more attractive to it, and it is under no contractual obligation to continue to develop its acreage dedicated to EQM.  
    
  EQGP and EQM believe the high percentage of EQM's revenues derived from reservation charges under long-term, firm contracts will mitigate the risk of revenue fluctuations due to changes in near-term supply and demand conditions and commodity prices. For more information see  Risks Inherent in EQM s Business - Any significant decrease in production of natural gas in EQM s areas of operation could adversely affect its business and operating results and reduce its distributable cash flow" included in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" of EQGP's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
    
  Other than the cash required to maintain the EQM General Partner's general partner interest in EQM, EQGP did not have material capital requirements separate from those of EQM prior to its IPO.  Going forward, EQGP expects its only capital requirements separate from EQM will be to provide funds for distributions or for the purchase of EQM general partner units if EQGP elects to maintain its existing general partner interest in EQM.  
    
  EQM s principal liquidity requirements are to finance its operations, fund capital expenditures and potential acquisitions, make cash distributions and satisfy any indebtedness obligations. EQM s ability to meet these liquidity requirements will depend on its ability to generate cash in the future as well as its ability to raise capital in banking, capital and other markets. EQM s available sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations, borrowing under EQM's credit facilities, cash on hand, debt offerings and issuances of additional EQM partnership units. EQM expects to fund its remaining 2016 capital expenditures with cash on hand and available debt capacity.  
    
  EQGP has a Working Capital Facility with EQT as discussed in Note G. As of   September 30, 2016  , EQGP had approximately   $0.1 million   outstanding under the Working Capital Facility. 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled   $368.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $318.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   $49.6 million   increase was driven by higher operating income for which contributing factors are discussed in the  Executive Overview  and "Business Segment Results of Operations" sections herein, distributions received from EES of $8.3 million and lower interest and income tax expense, partly offset by the timing of payments between the two periods. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash flows used in investing activities totaled   $494.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $891.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   $397.6 million   decrease was primarily attributable to the acquisition of the NWV Gathering net assets from EQT and the Preferred Interest Acquisition, both of which occurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . These decreases were partly offset by increased EQM capital expenditures as further described in the "EQM Capital Requirements" section herein. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities totaled   $224.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of   $402.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The primary financing uses of cash for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were net EQM credit facility repayments and distributions to EQM's noncontrolling interest unitholders and EQGP unitholders (including EQT). The primary financing sources of cash for this period were cash received from the sale of common units under the $750 million ATM Program. Financing cash inflows for the first   nine   months of   2015   were from EQM's March 2015 equity offering and net EQM credit facility borrowings; the primary financing cash payments were for the NWV Gathering Acquisition in excess of net assets acquired and distributions to EQT and EQM's noncontrolling interest unitholders.

EQM Capital Requirements 
    
  The gathering, transmission and storage businesses are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to develop new facilities and to maintain and upgrade existing operations. The following table presents EQM's capital expenditures for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

(1)    
    Expansion capital expenditures do not include capital contributions made to the MVP Joint Venture. Capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture were $35.6 million and $76.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. In the first quarter of 2015, EQM paid approximately $54.2 million for its acquisition of EQT's ownership interest in the MVP Joint Venture as described in Note B. 

Expansion capital expenditures increased by $65.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the timing of spending on projects. In the third quarter of 2016, expansion capital expenditures primarily related to the OVC, the Range Resources Header Pipeline project and the NWV Gathering expansion. In the third quarter of 2015, expansion capital expenditures primarily related to the OVC, the Jupiter and NWV Gathering expansions. EQM completed the Jupiter gathering expansion in the fourth quarter of 2015.  
    
  Expansion capital expenditures increased by $188.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the timing of spending on projects. In 2016, expansion capital expenditures primarily related to the OVC, the Range Resources Header Pipeline project and the NWV Gathering expansion. In 2015, expansion capital expenditures primarily related to the Jupiter and NWV Gathering expansions and the OVC. 
    
  In 2016, expansion capital expenditures and capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture are expected to be approximately $660 million and ongoing maintenance capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $25 million, net of reimbursements. EQM s future capital investments may vary significantly from period to period based on the available investment opportunities and are expected to grow substantially in future periods for the Range Resources Header Pipeline project, the NWV Gathering expansion, the gathering and AVC expansion projects associated with the October 2016 Acquisition and capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture. Maintenance related capital expenditures are also expected to vary quarter to quarter. EQM expects to fund future capital expenditures primarily through cash on hand, cash generated from operations, availability under its credit facility, debt offerings and issuances of additional EQM partnership units. EQM does not forecast capital expenditures associated with potential midstream projects not committed as of the filing of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
    
  EQM Credit Facility Borrowings 
    
  EQM has a $750 Million Facility that expires in February 2019 and had $91 million of borrowings outstanding as of September 30, 2016. The $750 Million Facility is available to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures, to purchase assets, to pay distributions, to repurchase units and for general partnership purposes. Subject to certain terms and conditions, the $750 Million Facility has an accordion feature that allows EQM to increase the available revolving borrowings under the facility by up to an additional $250 million. In addition, the $750 Million Facility includes a sublimit up to $75

million for same-day swing line advances and a sublimit up to $150 million for letters of credit. EQM has the right to request that one or more lenders make term loans to it under the $750 Million Facility subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, which term loans will be secured by cash and qualifying investment grade securities. EQM s obligations under the revolving portion of the $750 Million Facility are unsecured. 
    
  EQM s $750 Million Facility contains various provisions that, if not complied with, could result in termination of the credit facility, require early payment of amounts outstanding or similar actions. The covenants and events of default under the $750 Million Facility relate to maintenance of permitted leverage ratio, limitations on transactions with affiliates, limitations on restricted payments, insolvency events, nonpayment of scheduled principal or interest payments, acceleration of and certain other defaults under other financial obligations and change of control provisions. Under the $750 Million Facility, EQM is required to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 5.00 to 1.00 (or not more than 5.50 to 1.00 for certain measurement periods following the consummation of certain acquisitions). As of September 30, 2016, EQM was in compliance with all debt provisions and covenants. 
    
  On October 26, 2016, EQM entered into the 364-Day Facility (as defined in Note G) with EQT, which will mature on October 25, 2017. See Note G for further discussion of the uncommitted revolving loan agreement.  
    
  EQM Security Ratings 
    
  The table below sets forth the credit ratings for debt instruments of EQM at   September 30, 2016  .

EQM s credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. EQM cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant. If any credit rating agency downgrades EQM s ratings, EQM s access to the capital markets may be limited, borrowing costs could increase, EQM may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of commercial agreements such as joint venture agreements and construction contracts, the amount of which may be substantial, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. In order to be considered investment grade, a company must be rated Baa3 or higher by Moody s, BBB- or higher by S P, or BBB- or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings, including EQM's current credit rating of Ba1 by Moody's, is considered non-investment grade. 
    
  EQM $750 million ATM Program 
    
  As of   October 27, 2016  , EQM had approximately   $443 million   in remaining capacity under the $750 million ATM Program  . 
    
  Distributions  
    
  On   October 25, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the EQGP General Partner declared a cash distribution to EQGP s unitholders for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.165   per common unit, or approximately   $43.9 million  .  The distribution will be paid on   November 22, 2016   to unitholders of record at the close of business on   November 4, 2016  .  
    
  On   October 25, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the EQM General Partner declared a cash distribution to EQM's unitholders for the   third quarter   of   2016   of   $0.815   per common unit.  The cash distribution will be paid on   November 14, 2016   to unitholders of record, including EQGP, at the close of business on   November 4, 2016  . Based on the   80,581,758   EQM common units outstanding on   October 27, 2016  , cash distributions to EQGP will be approximately   $44.3 million   consisting of:   $17.8 million   related to its limited partner interest,   $1.6 million   related to its general partner interest and   $24.9 million   related to its IDRs in EQM. These distribution amounts to EQGP are subject to change if EQM issues additional common units on or prior to the record date for the   third   quarter 2016 distribution. 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , no legal or regulatory claims and proceedings were pending or, to EQGP's knowledge, threatened against EQGP.

     Table of Contents  

In the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against EQM.  While the amounts claimed may be substantial, EQM is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. EQM accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. EQM has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters, and after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, EQM believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against it will not materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to make distributions.  
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , EQM had issued a $91 million performance guarantee in favor of the MVP Joint Venture to provide performance assurances for MVP Holdco's obligations to fund its proportionate share of the construction budget for the MVP. Upon the FERC s initial release to begin construction of the MVP, EQM's guarantee will terminate and EQM will be obligated to issue a new guarantee in an amount equal to 33% of MVP Holdco s remaining obligations to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture in connection with the then remaining construction budget, less, subject to certain limits, any credit assurances issued by any affiliate of EQM under such affiliate's precedent agreement with the MVP Joint Venture. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  EQGP s critical accounting policies are described in Item 7,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  contained in EQGP s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  Any new accounting policies or updates to existing accounting policies as a result of new accounting pronouncements have been included in the notes to EQGP s consolidated financial statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016  . The application of EQGP s critical accounting policies may require management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements.  Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments.  Different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Changes in interest rates affect the amount of interest EQGP and EQM earn on cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments and the interest rates EQGP and EQM pay on borrowings on their credit facilities.  EQM's long-term borrowings are fixed rate and thus do not expose EQM to fluctuations in its results of operations or liquidity from changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates do affect the fair value of EQM's fixed rate debt. See Note G to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of EQGP's and EQM's borrowings and Note H to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of fair value measurements. EQGP or EQM may from time to time hedge the interest on portions of their borrowings under their credit facilities in order to manage risks associated with floating interest rates. 
    
  Credit Risk 
    
  EQGP is exposed to credit risk through EQM. Credit risk is the risk that EQM may incur a loss if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract. EQM manages its exposure to credit risk associated with customers through credit analysis, credit approval, credit limits and monitoring procedures. For certain transactions, EQM may request letters of credit, cash collateral, prepayments or guarantees as forms of credit support. EQM s FERC tariff requires tariff customers that do not meet specified credit standards to provide three months of credit support; however, EQM is exposed to credit risk beyond this three month period when its tariff does not require its customers to provide additional credit support. For some of EQM s more recent long-term contracts associated with system expansions, it has entered into negotiated credit agreements that provide for enhanced forms of credit support if certain credit standards are not met. EQM has historically experienced only minimal credit losses in connection with its receivables. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , approximately 90% of revenues were from investment grade counterparties. EQM is exposed to the credit risk of EQT, its largest customer. In connection with EQM's IPO in 2012, EQT guaranteed all payment obligations, up to a maximum of $50 million, due and payable to Equitrans by EQT Energy, LLC, one of Equitrans  largest customers and a wholly owned subsidiary of EQT. The EQT guaranty will terminate on November 30, 2023 unless terminated earlier by EQT upon 10 days written notice.  At   September 30, 2016  , EQT s public senior debt had an investment grade credit rating.  
  
   29 

Other Market Risks 
    
  EQM's $750 Million Facility is underwritten by a syndicate of financial institutions, each of which is obligated to fund its pro-rata portion of any borrowings by EQM. No one lender of the 18 financial institutions in the syndicate holds more than 10% of the facility. EQM s large syndicate group and relatively low percentage of participation by each lender is expected to limit EQM s exposure to problems or consolidation in the banking industry. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation of management of the EQGP General Partner, including the EQGP General Partner s Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, an evaluation of EQGP s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) was conducted as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer of the EQGP General Partner concluded that EQGP s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the   third quarter   of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, EQGP's internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , no legal and regulatory claims and proceedings were pending or, to EQGP's knowledge, threatened against EQGP. 
    
  In the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against EQM. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, EQM is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. EQM accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when actually incurred. EQM has established reserves it believes to be appropriate for pending matters and, after consultation with counsel and giving appropriate consideration to available insurance, EQM believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against it will not materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to make distributions. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  On April 8, 2016, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing new requirements applicable to natural gas transmission and gathering lines. As a result of the publication of the NPRM, EQGP determined to replace in its entirety the second paragraph of the risk factor entitled    EQM may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of pipeline integrity management program testing and related repairs    in Item 1A,  Risk Factors  of EQGP s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as follows:  
    
  Changes to pipeline safety laws and regulations that result in more stringent or costly safety standards could have a significant adverse effect on EQM and similarly situated midstream operators.  For example, in August 2011, PHMSA published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (2011 Notice) in which the agency was seeking public comment on a number of changes to regulations governing the safety of gas transmission pipelines and gathering lines, including, for example, revising the definitions of  high consequence areas  and  gathering lines  and strengthening integrity management requirements as they apply to existing regulated operators and to currently exempt operators should certain exemptions be removed. In April 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking responding to several of the integrity management topics raised in the 2011 Notice and proposing new requirements to address safety issues for natural gas transmission and gathering lines that have arisen since the issuance of the 2011 Notice.  The proposed rule, which is subject to a public comment period, would strengthen existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population 
  
   30 

densities and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. We are monitoring and evaluating the effect of these proposed requirements on EQM s operations. 
    
  Except as set forth above, as of the date of this report, EQGP's risk factors have not changed materially from those discussed in Item 1A,  Risk Factors  of EQGP s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  

Item 5. Other Information 
    
  364-Day Facility 
    
  On October 26, 2016, EQM entered into the 364-Day Facility (as defined in Note G) with EQT, which will mature on October 25, 2017. The 364-Day Facility will automatically renew for successive 364-day periods unless EQT delivers a non-renewal notice at least 60 days prior to the then current maturity date. EQM may terminate the 364-Day Facility at any time by repaying in full the unpaid principal amount of all loans together with interest thereon. The 364-Day Facility is available for general partnership purposes and does not contain any covenants other than the obligation to pay accrued interest on outstanding borrowings.  Interest will accrue on any outstanding borrowings at an interest rate equal to the rate then applicable to similar loans under EQM s $750 Million Facility (as defined in Note G), less the sum of (i) the then applicable commitment fee under the $750 Million Facility and (ii) 10 basis points. 
    
  The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the 364-Day Facility, which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and incorporated in this Item 5 by reference. 
    
  Relationships 
    
  The EQM General Partner is indirectly controlled by EQT through EQT s control of EQGP. As of September 30, 2016, EQGP and its subsidiaries owned 21,811,643 EQM common units, representing a 26.6% limited partnership interest, 1,443,015 EQM general partner units, representing a 1.8% general partner interest, and all of the incentive distribution rights in EQM. As of September 30, 2016, EQT owned 100% of the non-economic general partner interest and a 90.1% limited partner interest in EQGP.

  CERTIFICATION 
    
  In connection with the Quarterly     Report of EQT GP Holdings, LP ( EQGP ) on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the date hereof (the  Report ), the undersigned certify pursuant to   906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, that:
