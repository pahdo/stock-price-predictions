  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1.   
       Basis of Presentation    

The accompanying financial statements present
the financial position of Chinawe.com Inc. (the  Company  or  Chinawe ) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, and the results of operations for the Company and its subsidiary (up to date of disposal) for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated on consolidation. 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information
and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the
information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been
included. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

The balance sheet at December 31,
2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes
required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. These unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

2.   
       Organization    

Chinawe was incorporated under the laws
of the State of California. Chinawe s principal business activity was providing professional management services relating
to non-performing loans in the People s Republic of China, as well as other consulting services. During the first quarter
of 2009, the Company s sole customer, Huizhou One Limited, issued a notice of termination to terminate the services contracts
with effect from March 26 and March 27, 2009. Effective March 27, 2009, the Company became a non-operating company. 

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 include the accounts of Chinawe and the following subsidiary (sometimes
collectively referred to hereinafter as the  Company ): Officeway Technology Limited, a company incorporated in the
British Virgin Islands in December 1999, and sold to an independent third party on December 31, 2015. The unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 include the accounts of Chinawe only. 

3.   
       Going concern consideration    

The Company s unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
negative working capital and stockholders  deficit of U.S.$333,254 and U.S.$333,254, respectively, which raise substantial
doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. 

The Company has relied on private financing
by cash inflows from the principal stockholders of the Company, who have agreed not to demand repayment of amounts due to them
as long as the Company has negative working capital. These stockholders have indicated their intention to finance the Company for
a reasonable period of time to enable the Company to continue as a going concern, assuming that in such a period of time the Company
would not be able to raise additional capital to support its continuation. However, it is uncertain for how long or to what extent
such a period of time would be  reasonable  and there can be no assurance that the financing from these stockholders
will be continued. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include or reflect any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

4.   
       Due to related parties    

The balances with related parties are as follows: 

The amounts due are unsecured, non-interest bearing and repayable
on demand. 

5.   
       Contingencies    

The Company is currently suspended in the
State of California due to failure to file income tax returns with the Franchise Tax Board for numerous years. The Company is also
delinquent in filing its U.S. Federal tax returns and information forms for numerous years. Although for most of such years the
Company incurred losses and would not owe taxes except for minimum fees to California, the failure to file could result in interest
and penalties imposed upon the Company which would have a material adverse effect upon the Company s financial condition.
The Company has decided not to pursue reinstatement in California or prepare and file past due U.S. Federal tax returns and information
forms until it has formulated a plan for once again becoming an operating company. Management is unable to estimate the possible
losses with a reasonable degree of uncertainty. 

The Company s income tax returns
for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and State tax authorities,
generally for three years after they are filed. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

The following discussion should be read
in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Form
10-Q. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Our actual results may differ significantly from those projected
in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking
statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed elsewhere in this report. 

Overview   Results of Operations  

Effective March 27, 2009, the Company
ceased providing professional management services relating to non-performing loans in the People s Republic of China. The
Company has terminated its employees and closed down its offices. The Company has not identified a specific line of business or
territory for any new business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying a new line of business
that it can enter into or that if such new line of business is identified, that the Company will have adequate funding to commence
operations of a new line of business. The principal stockholders of the Company have indicated their intention to finance the Company
for a reasonable period of time to enable the Company to continue as a going concern, assuming that in such a period of time the
Company would not be able to raise additional capital to support its continuation. However, it is uncertain for how long or to
what extent such a period of time would be  reasonable  and there can be no assurance that financing from these stockholders
will be continued. 

NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED) COMPARED
TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)  

LOSS FROM OPERATIONS  

The Company s operating expenses totaled U.S.$15,779 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to U.S. $8,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in
operating expenses is attributable to the increase in professional fees. 

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES  

No income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 was incurred because the Company reported a net loss. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

The Company s unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had negative
working capital and stockholders  deficit of U.S.$333,254 and U.S.$333,254, respectively. 

The Company has relied on private financing
by cash inflows from the principal stockholders of the Company, who have agreed not to demand repayment of amounts due to them
as long as the Company has negative working capital. These stockholders have indicated their intention to finance the Company for
a reasonable period of time to enable the Company to continue as a going concern, assuming that in such a period of time the Company
would not be able to raise additional capital to support its continuation. However, it is uncertain for how long or to what extent
such a period of time would be  reasonable  and there can be no assurance that the financing from these stockholders
will be continued. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include or reflect any adjustments
that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES  

A company s financial statements
reflect the selection and application of accounting policies which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions.
Since the Company has no business, we believe there is no critical judgment area in the application of our accounting policies
that currently affects our financial condition and results of operations except for the disclosure set forth above under  LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES.  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material
to the Company. 

Future Operations  

The Company is seeking investment opportunities
that may provide revenues for the Company. However, the Company has not identified a specific line of business or territory for
any such new business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying a new line of business that
it can enter into or that if such new line of business is identified, that the receipt of revenues is probable. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk.  

We are not exposed to a material level
of market risk due to changes in interest rates, since we have never registered or issued debt instruments. Our outstanding long
term liabilities are loans from a director or other related parties, which are unsecured and interest rate fixed or interest-free. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures . 

(a)   
       Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

As of the end of the period covered by
this report, the Company conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, of its disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act )). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and which also are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the
Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

The Company s
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control over financial reporting
is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the (i) effectiveness and efficiency of operations, (ii) reliability
of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and (iii) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company s internal controls framework
is based on the criteria set forth in the Internal Control   Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). 

Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness
to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 

Management s assessment of the effectiveness
of the Company s internal control over financial reporting is as of the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We believe
that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. We have not identified any current material weaknesses considering
the nature and extent of our current operations and any risks or errors in financial reporting under current operations. 

(b)   
       Changes in Internal Controls    

There were no changes in the Company s
internal control over financial reporting for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably
likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
