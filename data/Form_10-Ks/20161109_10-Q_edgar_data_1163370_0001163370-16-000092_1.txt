NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
    
  (Unaudited) 

1.  Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and corresponding footnotes have been prepared by Northrim BanCorp, Inc. (the  Company ) in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and with instructions to Form 10-Q under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The year-end Consolidated Balance Sheet data was derived from the Company's audited financial statements. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements.  The Company owns a   100%   interest in Residential Mortgage Holding Company, LLC ("RML"), the parent company of Residential Mortgage, LLC ("Residential Mortgage") and a   50.1%   interest in Northrim Benefits Group, LLC ("NBG") and consolidates their balance sheets and income statements into its financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Certain immaterial reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to maintain consistency with the current year with no impact on net income or total shareholders  equity.  The Company determined that it operates in   two   primary operating segments: Community Banking and Home Mortgage Lending. The Company has evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure. Operating results for the interim period ended   September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results anticipated for the year ending   December 31, 2016  .  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The Company s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .   
  Correction of an Error 
  The Company identified and has corrected an error regarding the accounting for payments to be made by the Company to the   four   former equity owners of RML that were negotiated as part of the Company s acquisition of   76.5%   of the equity interest in RML on December 1, 2014.    Three   of the   four   former equity owners of RML have continuing employment contracts with the Company, and under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the payments are terminated for future periods if any   two   of these   three   continuing employees terminate employment before November 30, 2019. The fair value of the estimated payments was recorded as acquisition consideration on December 1, 2014, and accrued as a contingent liability.  The Company has determined that these payments are more appropriately accounted for as compensation expense in the period they are incurred. Changes in the value of the contingent liability that was initially recorded when the Company acquired RML have previously been reflected on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Income in the  Change in fair value, RML earn-out liability  line item in prior periods.  As of September 30, 2016, this line item has been renamed to  Compensation expense - RML acquisition payments , and the payments to the sellers of RML are expensed and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income in that same line item.  Management evaluated the materiality of the error from qualitative and quantitative perspectives and concluded that the error was immaterial to the prior period financial statements taken as a whole. Consequently, the financial statements contained in this report have been revised for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, and prior period financial statements have not been restated.  
    
  The error correction reduces the total purchase price of RML from   $29.5 million   to   $22.2 million   and reduces the amount of goodwill recorded in the RML acquisition from   $14.8 million   to   $7.5 million  . The error correction eliminates the contingent liability originally recorded as part of the purchase consideration and results in the accrual of compensation expense, which is included in other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  Accrued compensation expense related to these payments is   $3.3 million   as of September 30, 2016 and represents compensation accrued for the period of December 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016.  The error correction reduced net income by   $1.4 million   and covered the period from December 1, 2014, through June 30, 2016.  Additionally, the change in the accounting treatment of these payments also reduced net income for the third quarter of 2016 by   $213,000   for a total decrease in net income of   $1.6 million   in the third quarter of 2016. The change did not affect the total cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.  
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ).  ASU 2016-01 requires that equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at  
  
   9 

cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer; simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value; eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities; eliminate the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; require public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. ASU 2016-01 is effective for the Company s financial statements for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, and the Company will apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and the amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) will be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of ASU 2016-01. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about lease arrangements.   ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Company s financial statements for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018, and must be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating how the adoption of this standard will impact the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Option in Debt Instruments   ( ASU 2016-06 ). ASU 2016-06 simplifies the embedded derivative analysis for debt instruments containing contingent call or put options by removing the requirement to assess whether a contingent event is related to interest rates or credit risks. ASU 2016-06 is effective for the Company's financial statements for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   ( ASU 2016-07 ). ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. ASU 2016-17 requires that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. ASU 2016-07 is effective for the Company s financial statements for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and must be applied prospectively. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Company s financial statements for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2016, and must be applied prospectively. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses   ( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) that is measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset or assets to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The  
  
   10 

income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. The allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ("PCD assets") that are measured at amortized cost basis is determined in a similar manner to other financial assets measured at amortized cost basis; however, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit loss expense. Only subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a credit loss expense for these assets. Interest income for PCD assets should be recognized based on the effective interest rate, excluding the discount embedded in the purchase price that is attributable to the acquirer s assessment of credit losses at acquisition. ASU 2016-13 requires credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Available-for-sale accounting recognizes that value may be realized either through collection of contractual cash flows or through sale of the security. Therefore, the amendments limit the amount of the allowance for credit losses to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost because the classification as available for sale is premised on an investment strategy that recognizes that the investment could be sold at fair value, if cash collection would result in the realization of an amount less than fair value. The allowance for credit losses for purchased available-for-sale securities with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination is determined in a similar manner to other available-for-sale debt securities; however, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than reported as a credit loss expense. Only subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded in credit loss expense. Interest income should be recognized based on the effective interest rate, excluding the discount embedded in the purchase price. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Company s financial statements for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2019, and must be applied prospectively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial position and results of operations.  
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies; distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company s financial statements for annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017, and must be applied retrospectively for each period presented. The Company does not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.  

2  .  Business Combinations 
  Residential Mortgage Holding Company, LLC 
    
  On December 1, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of   76.5%   of the equity interest in RML, the parent company of Residential Mortgage. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company's presence in the mortgage lending business in Alaska. The fair value of the Company's   23.5%   equity interest in RML immediately prior to the acquisition was   $9.0 million  . The Company recorded a   $3.0 million   gain in the fourth quarter of 2014 as a result of remeasuring the Company's equity interest in RML immediately prior to the acquisition, which was included in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Income in the line item entitled "Gain on purchase of mortgage affiliate". The Company utilized a market value approach to value its   23.5%   equity interest in RML which included analysis of current trading values and historical acquisition multiples of comparable mortgage companies. The consideration transferred or transferable to the former owners of RML and the assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the December 1, 2014 acquisition date.  
    
  The former owners of RML (the "sellers") receive additional cash proceeds (the  payments ) based on the adjusted earnings of RML in all or a portion of the calendar years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019. The estimated value of these payments was initially recorded as a   $7.3 million   contingent liability as of December 1, 2014 as part of its acquisition accounting for future earn-out payments. The total contingent liability as of December 31, 2015 was   $6.6 million  . For the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded adjustments of   $780,000   and   $2.9 million  , respectively, to increase the contingent liability. The increase in the contingent liability resulted from the excess of RML's pretax income for these  
  
   11 

periods over and above estimates made at the close of the purchase of RML. The Company made its first payment to the sellers in the fourth quarter of 2015 for approximately   $4.9 million  .  
           
  As described in Note 1, the Company has identified that accounting for these payments as purchase consideration was an error at the time of the purchase, and when this error was corrected in the third quarter of 2016, the contingent liability previously recorded for these payments was eliminated.  Following the error correction, payments owed to the sellers of RML are recorded as  compensation expense - RML acquisition payments  in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are accrued in other liabilities in the period in which they are incurred.  The Company did not restate prior period financial statements for the correction of this error because management determined that the impact was not material.     
    
  Per the purchase agreement, the payments are calculated as follows: 

The Company estimates the amount of compensation expense for RML acquisition payments based on internal projections of adjusted earnings of RML, and this expense was   $3.3 million   and   $4.1 million   for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively, including   $2.8 million   in expense to correct the error described in Note 1.  The accrued liability relating to the RML acquisition payments is   $3.3 million   as of September 30, 2016.  The RML acquisition payments are paid to the sellers annually in December. 

3  .  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The Company is required to maintain a   $500,000   minimum average daily balance with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco ("Federal Reserve Bank") for purposes of settling financial transactions and charges for Federal Reserve Bank services. The Company is also required to maintain cash balances or deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank sufficient to meet its statutory reserve requirements.  
  The Company is required to maintain a   $500,000   balance with a correspondent bank for outsourced servicing of ATMs. 
  
   12 

4  . Investment Securities 
  The carrying values and estimated fair values of investment securities at the periods indicated are presented below: 

13 

Gross unrealized losses on investment securities and the fair value of the related securities, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

The unrealized losses on investments in U.S. treasury and government sponsored entities, preferred stock, and municipal securities in both periods were caused by changes in interest rates. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, there were   eight   and   thirty-nine   available-for-sale securities with unrealized losses that have been in a loss position for less than twelve months. There were   two   and   six   securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   that have been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months.  The contractual terms of the investments in a loss position do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment.  Because it is more likely than not that the Company will hold these investments until a market price recovery or maturity, these investments are not considered other-than-temporarily impaired. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $51.6 million   and   $59.7 million   in securities were pledged for deposits and borrowings.  

14 

The amortized cost and estimated fair values of debt securities at   September 30, 2016  , are distributed by contractual maturity as shown below.  Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  Although preferred stock has no stated maturity, it is aggregated in the calculation of weighted average yields presented below in the category of investments that mature in ten years or more. 

The proceeds and resulting gains and losses, computed using specific identification, from sales of investment securities for the   nine   months ending   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, are as follows:  

A summary of interest income for the   nine   months ending   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , on available for sale investment securities is as follows: 

15 

5  .  Loans and Credit Quality 
  The following table presents total portfolio loans by portfolio segment and class of financing receivable, based on our asset quality rating ("AQR") criteria:  

Loans are carried at their principal amount outstanding, net of charge-offs, unamortized fees and direct loan origination costs.  Loan balances are charged-off to the allowance for loan losses ("Allowance") when management believes that collection of principal is unlikely.  Interest income on loans is accrued and recognized on the principal amount outstanding except for loans in a nonaccrual status.  All classes of loans are placed on nonaccrual and considered impaired when management believes doubt exists as to the collectability of the interest or principal.  Cash payments received on nonaccrual loans are directly applied to the principal balance.  Generally, a loan may be returned to accrual status when the delinquent principal and interest is brought current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.  Additionally, certain ongoing performance criteria, which generally includes a performance period of six months, must be met in order for a loan to be returned to accrual status.  Loans are reported as past due when installment payments, interest payments, or maturity payments are past due based on contractual terms. 
  Nonaccrual loans:   Nonaccrual loans net of government guarantees totaled   $9.3 million   and   $2.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Nonaccrual loans at the periods indicated, by segment, are presented below:

Past Due Loans:   Past due loans and nonaccrual loans at the periods indicated are presented below by segment: 

Impaired Loans:   The Company considers a loan to be impaired when it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  Once a loan is determined to be impaired, the impairment is measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, except that if the loan is collateral dependent, the impairment is measured by using the fair value of the loan s collateral.  Nonperforming loans greater than   $50,000   are individually evaluated for impairment based upon the borrower s overall financial condition, resources, and payment record, and the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors. 
  
   17 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the recorded investment in loans that are considered to be impaired was   $44.8 million   and   $34.6 million  , respectively.  The following table presents information about impaired loans by class as of the periods indicated:

Purchased Credit Impaired Loans:   The Company acquired   18   purchased credit impaired loans in connection with its acquisition of Alaska Pacific Bancshares, Inc. on April 1, 2014 subject to the requirements of FASB ASC 310-30   Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality.    This group of loans consists primarily of commercial and commercial real estate loans, and unlike a pool of consumer mortgages, it is not practicable for the Company to analyze the accretable yield of these loans.   As such, the Company has elected the cost recovery method of income recognition for these loans, and thus   no   accretable yield has been identified for these loans.  At the acquisition date, April 1, 2014, the fair value of this group of loans was   $3.9 million  . The carrying value of these loans as of September 30, 2016 is   $1.2 million  . 
  Troubled Debt Restructurings:   Loans classified as troubled debt restructurings ( TDR ) totaled   $16.3 million   and   $13.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  A TDR is a loan to a borrower that is experiencing financial difficulty that has been modified from its original terms and conditions in such a way that the Company is granting the borrower a concession that it would not grant otherwise.  The Company has granted a variety of concessions to borrowers in the form of loan modifications.  The modifications granted can generally be described in the following categories: 
  Rate Modification  :  A modification in which the interest rate is changed. 
  Term Modification  :  A modification in which the maturity date, timing of payments, or frequency of payments is changed. 
  Payment Modification  :  A modification in which the dollar amount of the payment is changed, or in which a loan is converted to interest only payments for a period of time is included in this category. 
  Combination Modification  :  Any other type of modification, including the use of multiple categories above.  
  AQR pass graded loans included above in the impaired loan data are loans classified as TDRs.  By definition, TDRs are considered impaired loans.  All of the Company's TDRs are included in impaired loans. 
  
   21 

The following table presents the breakout between newly restructured loans that occurred during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and restructured loans that occurred prior to 2016 that are still included in portfolio loans: 

The following table presents newly restructured loans that occurred during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , by concession (terms modified): 

The Company had   no   commitments to extend additional credit to borrowers whose terms have been modified in TDRs. There were   no   charge offs in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   on loans that were later classified as TDRs. 
  All TDRs are also classified as impaired loans and are included in the loans individually evaluated for impairment in the calculation of the Allowance. There were   no   TDRs with specific impairment at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
       The Company had   no   TDRs that subsequently defaulted within the first twelve months of restructure, during the periods ending   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

7  .  Purchased Receivables 
  Purchased receivables are carried at their principal amount outstanding, net of a reserve for anticipated losses that have not yet been identified, and have a maturity of less than   one   year.  Purchased receivable balances are charged against this reserve when management believes that collection of principal is unlikely.  Management evaluates the adequacy of the reserve for purchased receivable losses based on historical loss experience by class of receivable and its assessment of current economic conditions.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has   one   class of purchased receivables.  There were   no   purchased receivables past due at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and there were   no   restructured purchased receivables at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Income on purchased receivables is accrued and recognized on the principal amount outstanding using an effective interest method except when management believes doubt exists as to the collectability of the income or principal.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company is accruing income on all purchased receivable balances outstanding.   
  The following table summarizes the components of net purchased receivables for the periods indicated: 

The following table sets forth information regarding changes in the purchased receivable reserve for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:  

The Company did not record any charge-offs in the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

8  .  Derivatives 
  The Company enters into commercial loan interest rate swap agreements with commercial banking customers which are offset with a corresponding swap agreement with a third party financial institution ("counterparty"). The Company has agreements with its counterparties that contain provisions that provide that if the Company fails to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution, then the counterparty could terminate the derivative positions and the Company would be required to settle its obligations under the agreements. These agreements also require that the Company and the counterparty collateralize any fair value shortfalls that exceed   $250,000   with eligible collateral, which includes cash and securities backed with the full faith and credit of the federal government. Similarly, the Company could be required to settle its obligations under the agreement if specific regulatory events occur, such as if the Company were issued a prompt corrective action directive or a cease and desist order, or if certain regulatory ratios fall below specified levels. The Company pledged   $303,000   and   $216,000   in available for sale securities to collateralize fair value shortfalls on interest rate swap agreements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  The Company had interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of   $19.5 million   and   $21.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , the notional amount of interest rate swaps is made up of   two   variable to fixed rate swaps to commercial loan customers totaling   $9.8 million  , and   two   fixed to variable rate swaps with a counterparty totaling   $9.8 million  .  Changes in fair value from these   four   interest rate swaps offset each other in the first nine months of   2016  .  The Company did not recognize any fee income related to interest rate swaps in the three or nine month  
  
   26 

periods ending   September 30, 2016   or   2015  , respectively. Interest rate swap income is recorded in other income on the   Consolidated Statements of Income  .   
  The Company also uses derivatives to hedge the risk of changes in the fair values of interest rate lock commitments. The Company enters into commitments to originate residential mortgage loans at specific rates; the value of these commitments are detailed in the table below as "interest rate lock commitments".  The Company also hedges the interest rate risk associated with its residential mortgage loan commitments, which are referred to as retail interest rate contracts in the table below. Market risk with respect to commitments to originate loans arises from changes in the value of contractual positions due to changes in interest rates. RML had commitments to originate mortgage loans held for sale totaling   $72.3 million   and   $71.3 million   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Changes in the value of RML's interest rate derivatives are recorded in the mortgage banking income on the   Consolidated Statements of Income  .  
  The following table presents the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The following table presents the net gains of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments for the nine month periods ending   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively: 

Our derivative transactions with counterparties under International Swaps and Derivative Association master agreements include "right of set-off" provisions. "Right of set-off" provisions are legally enforceable rights to offset recognized amounts and there may be an intention to settle such amounts on a net basis. We do not offset such financial instruments for financial reporting purposes.

9  .  Stock Incentive Plan 
  The Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan ( 2014 Plan ) following shareholder approval of the 2014 Plan at the 2014 Annual Meeting.  Subsequent to the adoption of the 2014 Plan, no additional grants may be issued under the prior plans.  The 2014 Plan provides for grants of up to   350,000   shares of common stock. 
    Stock Options:    Under the 2014 Plan and previous plans, certain key employees have been granted the option to purchase set amounts of common stock at the market price on the day the option was granted.  Optionees, at their own discretion, may cover the cost of exercise through the exchange at the then fair value of already owned shares of the Company s stock.  Options are granted for a   10  -year period and vest on a pro-rata basis over the initial   three   years from grant. 
  The Company measures the fair value of each stock option at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized   $34,000   and   $22,000  , respectively, in stock option compensation expense as a component of salaries and other personnel expense. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized   $121,000   and   $66,000  , respectively, in stock option compensation expense as a component of salaries and other personnel expense. 
  The Company issued   5,342   shares from the exercise of stock options for both the three and nine month ended September 30,   2016  . Proceeds from the exercise of stock options in both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were   $847,000  . The Company withheld   $907,000   to pay for stock option exercises or income taxes that resulted from the exercise of stock options in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  
   28 

The Company issued   4,938   and   5,162   shares from the exercise of stock options in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Proceeds from the exercise of stock options in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were   $160,000   and   $209,000  , respectively. The Company withheld   $63,000   and   $112,000   to pay for stock option exercises or income taxes that resulted from the exercise of stock options in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
  There were   no   stock options granted in the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    Restricted Stock Units:    The Company grants restricted stock units to certain key employees periodically.  Recipients of restricted stock units do not pay any cash consideration to the Company for the shares and receive all dividends with respect to such shares when the shares vest. Restricted stock units cliff vest at the end of a   three  -year time period. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recognized   $120,000   and   $98,000  , respectively, in restricted stock unit compensation expense as a component of salaries and other personnel expense. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized   $410,000   and   $291,000  , respectively, in restricted stock unit compensation expense as a component of salaries and other personnel expense. 
  There were   no   restricted stock units granted in the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

10  .  Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities  
  The Company groups its assets and liabilities measured at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value. These levels are: 
             
    Level 1  :  Valuation is based upon quoted prices for identical instruments traded in active exchange markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange.  Valuations are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2  :  Valuation is based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 
                
    Level 3  :  Valuation is generated from model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market.  These unobservable assumptions reflect the Company s estimation of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  Valuation techniques include use of option pricing models, discounted cash flow models and similar techniques. 
     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate fair value disclosures.  All financial instruments are held for other than trading purposes.  
  Cash and cash equivalents  : Due to the short term nature of these instruments, the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets represent their fair values. 
  Investment securities  : Fair values for investment securities are based on quoted market prices, where available.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices of comparable instruments.  Investments in Federal Home Loan Bank stock are recorded at cost, which also represents fair value. 
  Loans held for sale  :  Due to the short term nature of these instruments, the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate their fair values. 
  Loans  :  Fair values were generally determined by discounting both principal and interest cash flows on pools of loans expected to be collected using a discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that the Company believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value.  The Company estimates the cash flows expected to be collected using internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate the Corporation s best estimate of current key assumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment speeds for the life of the loan.  
  Purchased receivables  : Fair values for purchased receivables are based on their carrying amounts due to their short duration and repricing frequency.  Generally, purchased receivables have a duration of less than   one   year. 
  Mortgage servicing rights:   MSR are held at fair value. These assets are classified as Level 3 as quoted prices are not available.   In order to determine the fair value of MSRs, the present value of net expected future cash flows is estimated.  Assumptions used  
  
   29 

include market discount rates, anticipated prepayment speeds, escrow calculations, delinquency rates, and ancillary fee income net of servicing costs.  The model assumptions are also compared to publicly filed information from several large MSR holders, as available. 
  Accrued interest receivable  : Due to the short term nature of these instruments, the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets represent their fair values. 
  Deposits  : The fair value for deposits with stated maturities was determined by discounting contractual cash flows using current market rates for instruments with similar maturities. For deposits with no stated maturities, the carrying value was considered to approximate fair value and does not take into account the significant value of the cost advantage and stability of the Company's long-term relationships with depositors. 
  Accrued interest payable  : Due to the short term nature of these instruments, the carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets represent their fair values. 
  Securities sold under repurchase agreements  : Fair values for securities sold under repurchase agreements are based on their carrying amounts due to their short duration and repricing frequency. 
  Borrowings  : Due to the short term nature of these instruments, the carrying amount of short-term borrowings reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate the fair value.  Fair values for long-term borrowings are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies currently offered interest rates to a schedule of aggregate expected monthly payments. 
  Accrued liability, RML acquisition payments:   The carrying value of the accrued liability for estimated acquisition payments represents management's estimate of amounts owed to the sellers that are earned, but unpaid, as of the balance sheet date. Adjustments to the liability are reported in other operating expense.  The fair value for this liability represents management's estimate of the total amount owed to the sellers that is earned as of the balance sheet date plus management's estimate of amounts that will be earned and paid to the sellers under the terms of the acquisition RML agreement for future periods.  The estimate is based on management's assessment of expected pre-tax income at RML over the remaining earn out period.  Inputs to this assessment include the general economic conditions in our markets that impact mortgage loan originations, current and anticipated trends in local market demand for mortgage, including interest rates, and RML's estimated market share.  
  Junior subordinated debentures  : Fair value adjustments for junior subordinated debentures are based on discounted cash flows to maturity using current interest rates for similar financial instruments.  Management utilized a market approach to determine the appropriate discount rate for junior subordinated debentures. 
  Derivative instruments:   The fair value of the interest rate lock commitments are estimated using quoted or published market prices for similar instruments, adjusted for factors such as pull-through rate assumptions based on historical information, where appropriate. The pull-through rate assumptions are considered Level 3 valuation inputs and are significant to the interest rate lock commitment valuation; as such, the interest rate lock commitment derivatives are classified as Level 3.  Interest rate contracts are valued in a model, which uses as its basis a discounted cash flow technique incorporating credit valuation adjustments to reflect nonperformance risk in the measurement of fair value. Although the Bank has determined that the majority of inputs used to value its interest rate derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. However, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank has assessed the significance of the impact of these adjustments on the overall valuation of its interest rate positions and has determined that they are not significant to the overall valuation of its interest rate derivatives. As a result, the Bank has classified its interest rate derivative valuations in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  
  Assets subject to nonrecurring adjustment to fair value  : The Company is also required to measure certain assets such as equity method investments, goodwill, intangible assets, impaired loans, and other real estate owned ( OREO ) at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with GAAP.  Any nonrecurring adjustments to fair value usually result from the write down of individual assets. 
  The Company uses either in-house evaluations or external appraisals to estimate the fair value of OREO and impaired loans as of each reporting date.  In-house appraisals are considered Level 3 inputs and external appraisals are considered Level 2 inputs. The Company s determination of which method to use is based upon several factors.  The Company takes into account compliance with legal and regulatory guidelines, the amount of the loan, the size of the assets, the location and type of property to be valued and how critical the timing of completion of the analysis is to the assessment of value.  Those factors are balanced  
  
   30 

with the level of internal expertise, internal experience and market information available, versus external expertise available such as qualified appraisers, brokers, auctioneers and equipment specialists. 
  The Company uses external sources to estimate fair value for projects that are not fully constructed as of the date of valuation.  These projects are generally valued as if complete, with an appropriate allowance for cost of completion, including contingencies developed from external sources such as vendors, engineers and contractors.  The Company believes that recording other real estate owned that is not fully constructed based on as if complete values is more appropriate than recording other real estate owned that is not fully constructed using as is values.  We concluded that as-is-complete values are appropriate for these types of projects based on the accounting guidance for capitalization of project costs and subsequent measurement of the value of real estate.  GAAP specifically states that estimates and cost allocations must be reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reallocated based on revised estimates.  The Company adjusts the carrying value of other real estate owned in accordance with this guidance for increases in estimated cost to complete that exceed the fair value of the real estate at the end of each reporting period. 
  Commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit  : The fair value of commitments is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties.  For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates.  The fair value of letters of credit is based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate them or otherwise settle the obligation with the counterparties at the reporting date. 
  Limitations  : Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.  These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.  These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates. 
  
   31 

Estimated fair values as of the periods indicated are as follows: 

(1)    Carrying amounts reflect the notional amount of credit exposure under these financial instruments.

The following table provides a reconciliation of the assets and liabilities measured at fair value using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) on a recurring basis during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

34 

As of and for the periods ending   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, no impairment or valuation adjustment was recognized for assets recognized at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, except for certain assets as shown in the following table.  For loans measured for impairment, the Company classifies fair value measurements using observable inputs, such as external appraisals, as Level 2 valuations in the fair value hierarchy, and unobservable inputs, such as in-house evaluations, as Level 3 valuations in the fair value hierarchy.

  This quarterly report on Form 10-Q includes  forward-looking statements,  as that term is defined for purposes of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which are not historical facts. These forward-looking statements describe management s expectations about future events and developments such as future operating results, growth in loans and deposits, continued success of the Company s style of banking, and the strength of the local economy. All statements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position, made in this report are forward-looking. We use words such as  anticipate,   believe,   expect,   intend  and similar expressions in part to help identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management s current plans and expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management s expectations, and those variations may be both material and adverse. Forward-looking statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially and adversely from our expectations as indicated in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include: the general condition of, and changes in, the Alaska economy; our ability to maintain or expand our market share or net interest margin; our ability to maintain asset quality; our ability to implement our marketing and growth strategies; and our ability to execute our business plan.  Further, actual results may be affected by competition on price and other factors with other financial institutions; customer acceptance of new products and services; the regulatory environment in which we operate; and general trends in the local, regional and national banking industry and economy. Many of these risks, as well as other risks that may have a material adverse impact on our operations and business, are identified in Part II. Item 1A Risk Factors of this report and Item 1A in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as well as in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, you should be aware that these factors are not an exhaustive list, and you should not assume these are the only factors that may cause our actual results to differ from our expectations.  In addition, you should note that forward looking statements are made only as of the date of this report and that we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements or the uncertainties that may adversely impact those statements, other than as required by law. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances.  We believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, actual results may differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions which could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and on our results of operations for the reporting periods. 
  The accounting policies that involve significant estimates and assumptions by management, which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities, are considered critical accounting policies. The Company s critical accounting policies include those that address the accounting for the allowance for loan losses ("Allowance"), valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, the valuation of other real estate owned, and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights.  These critical accounting policies are further described in Item 7, Management s Discussion and Analysis, and in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,   2015  .   
  
   38 

Management has applied its critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.   
    
  Update on Economic Conditions 
  According to the Alaska Department of Labor, preliminary data shows that average employment in the Alaska economy was down an estimated 0.20% in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 as job losses in the oil and gas industry, construction, state government and professional and business services continue to be partially offset by growth in retail trade, health care, and leisure and hospitality jobs.  However, estimated employment as of the end of September 2016 compared to September 2015 was down 1.0%. While the decreases in both average and period end estimated employment represent a more moderate overall impact from the decrease in the global price of oil compared to what other energy producing regions in the nation have experienced thus far, this is a larger decline than was originally predicted for 2016.  
  Highlights and Summary of Performance - Third Quarter of   2016    
    Net income attributable to the Company in the third quarter of 2016 was $3.1 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $5.3 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, in the third quarter of 2015.  This decrease in net income attributable to the Company was mainly the result of a one-time, non-cash accounting error correction, higher operating expenses, and a decrease in net interest margin and mortgage income primarily due to slowing loan growth in both the commercial and mortgage market in Alaska.  

Total revenues, which include net interest income plus other operating income, decreased 3% to $26.1 million in the third quarter of 2016 from total revenues of $27.1 million in the third quarter a year ago, mainly as a result of less gain on sale of loans acquired from Alaska Pacific Bancshares, Inc. 
                  
    Northrim paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share in September of 2016, compared to the $0.19 per share dividend paid in September 2015. The dividend provides a yield of approximately 3.3% at current market share prices.   
         
  The Company reported net income attributable to the Company and diluted earnings per share of $3.1 million and $0.44, respectively, for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to net income and diluted earnings per share of $5.3 million and $0.77, respectively, for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The Company reported net income and diluted earnings per share of $10.8 million and $1.55, respectively year to date as of September 30, 2016 compared to net income and diluted earnings per share of $13.7 million and $1.97, respectively, for the same period in 2015. The Company s total assets were $1.5 billion at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Loans increased to $997.1 million at   September 30, 2016   as compared to $980.8 million at   December 31, 2015  , mainly due to an increase in commercial real estate owner-occupied loans in the first nine months of 2016.  
  
   39 

The Company's shareholders' equity to total assets was   12.06%   and   11.82%   at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The accounting correction resulted in the Company s return on average equity and return on average assets being lower by 180 basis points and 25 basis points , respectively, than they would have been without the accounting correction. 
  Other financial measures are shown in the table below: 

Credit Quality 
  Nonperforming assets:    Nonperforming assets, net of government guarantees at   September 30, 2016   increased $6.9 million, or 133% to $12.1 million as compared to $5.2 million at   December 31, 2015  , primarily as a result of the addition of two lending relationships to nonaccrual loans totaling $8.1 million. One $5.9 million relationship is related to a residential land development project in the greater Anchorage market.  The loan has been included in adversely classified loans since December 31, 2015.  The other $2.2 million relationship is made up of three loans to a commercial business in the transportation industry, and these loans have been adversely classified loans since March 31, 2016.   The increase in nonaccrual loans was partially offset by a decrease in other real estate owned ("OREO") which decreased $229,000 to $2.8 million at   September 30, 2016   as compared to $3.1 million at   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Nonperforming purchased receivables were zero at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
  The following table summarizes OREO activity for the three and nine month periods ending   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Potential problem loans:    Potential problem loans are loans which are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms but that have developed negative indications that the borrower may not be able to comply with present payment terms and which may later be included in nonaccrual, past due, or impaired loans.  These loans are closely monitored and their performance is reviewed by management on a regular basis. At   September 30, 2016  , management had identified potential problem loans of $32.2 million as compared to potential problem loans of $28.9 million at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in potential problem loans from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 is primarily the result of one $4.7 million relationship with a commercial business that provides equipment rental services to the oil and gas industry. 
  Troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ):    TDRs are those loans for which concessions, including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to that borrower, have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition.  Interest on TDRs will be accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur, and the interest can be collected, which is generally after a period of six months.  The Company had $14.9 million in loans classified as TDRs that were performing and $1.3 million in TDRs included in nonaccrual loans at   September 30, 2016   for a total of approximately $16.2 million.  At   December 31, 2015   there were $11.8 million in loans classified as TDRs that were performing  
  
   40 

and $1.9 million in TDRs included in nonaccrual loans for a total of $13.7 million.  See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this report for further discussion of TDRs. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Income Statement  
  Net Income 
  Net income attributable to the Company for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased $2.2 million, or 42%, to $3.1 million as compared to $5.3 million for the same period in   2015  . Net income attributable to the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $2.9 million, or 21%, to $10.8 million as compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in net income attributable to the Company for the three and nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods of   2015   was primarily the result of a one-time, non-cash accounting error correction, higher operating expenses, and a decrease in net interest margin and mortgage income primarily due to slowing loan growth in both the commercial and mortgage market in Alaska.  
  Net Interest Income/Net Interest Margin 
  Net interest income for the   third   quarter of   2016   decreased $469,000, or 3%, to $14.2 million as compared to $14.7 million for the   third   quarter in   2015  .  Net interest income was relatively flat at $42.5 million in both the first nine months of 2016 and 2015. Net interest margin decreased 21 basis points to 4.11% in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 4.32% in the third quarter of 2015. Net interest margin decreased 17 basis points to 4.18% in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to 4.35% for the same period in 2015. The decrease in net interest income in the three-month period ending September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily the result of the decrease in interest income on average interest-earning assets mainly due to a lower average yield on loans, which was partially offset by higher average portfolio investment balances and lower interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, primarily due to lower average rates paid on both deposits and borrowings,  as well as lower average balances of borrowings in the third quarter of 2016. Net interest income in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 remained relatively consistent with net interest income in the same period of 2015 primarily as a result of a lower average yield on loans, which was more than offset by higher average portfolio investment balances and lower interest-bearing liabilities primarily due to lower average borrowings in 2016. 
  Average loan balances, the largest category of interest-earning assets, decreased by $3.1 million to $979.2 million in the three-month period ending   September 30, 2016  , and increased $11.0 million, or 1%, to $976.3 million in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  Total interest income from loans decreased $640,000 for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of 2015 and decreased $584,000 in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in   2015   mainly primarily due to a lower yield on loans in 2016.     Average loan balances increased in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of growth in commercial real estate loans.   
  Average loans held for sale increased by $10.2 million, or 18% to $66.6 million in the three-month period ending   September 30, 2016  , and decreased $4.1 million, or 7% to $51.3 million in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in   2015  , respectively. Total interest income from loans held for sale increased $22,000 for the   third   quarter of   2016   as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of the increase in average balances of loans held for sale being partially offset by lower average yields in the third quarter of 2016. Total interest income from loans held for sale decreased $148,000 in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily as a result of the decrease in average balances of loans held for sale. Average balances and net interest income for loans held for sale decreased in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period last year primarily as a result of decreased refinance activity in 2016. 
  Average total investments increased by $21.6 million, or 7% to $329.7 million in the three-month period ending September 30, 2016, and increased $41.3 million, or 14% to $328.7 million in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015. The increase in average investments for the three and six month periods ending June 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015 was mainly the result of purchases of long-term investments funded by increased deposit balances.  
  Average interest-bearing liabilities increased $8.4 million, or 1%, to $850.1 million during the third quarter of 2016 and increased $14.7 million, or 2%, to $853.2 million in the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016, as compared to $841.6 million and $838.5 million, for the same periods in   2015  , respectively. These increases were primarily the result of increased interest-bearing deposit balances which were partially offset by a decrease in borrowings in 2016. The average cost of interest- 
  
   41 

bearing liabilities decreased $59,000, or 8%, and $278,000, or 13% for the three and nine-month periods ending   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , primarily due to decreased average balances for borrowings, as well as decreased average interest rates on deposits in 2016.  Interest rates on deposits decreased mainly due to a change in the mix of the Company's deposits in 2016 compared to 2015. Average certificates of deposits accounted for 11% of total average deposits for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 11% and 12% of total average deposits year-to-date at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Average non-interest-bearing demand deposits accounted for 37% and 36% of total average deposits for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 35% of total average deposits year-to-date at September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Components of Net Interest Margin  
  The following table compares average balances and rates as well as net tax equivalent margins on earning assets for the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

1   Interest income includes loan fees.  Loan fees recognized during the period and included in the yield calculation totaled $805,000 and $923,000 in the third quarter of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   2   Nonaccrual loans are included with a zero effective yield.  Average nonaccrual loans included in the computation of the average loan balances were $11.1 million and $4.1 million in the third quarter of   2016   and   2015  , respectively  . 
   3   Consists of interest bearing deposits in other banks. 
   4   Consists of investment securities available for sale, investment securities held to maturity, and investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock.

The following table compares average balances and rates as well as net tax equivalent margins on earning assets for the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

1   Interest income includes loan fees.  Loan fees recognized during the period and included in the yield calculation totaled $2.4 million and $2.7 million in the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
   2   Nonaccrual loans are included with a zero effective yield.  Average nonaccrual loans included in the computation of the average loan balances were $6.4 million and $4.5 million in the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively  . 
   3   Consists of interest bearing deposits in other banks. 
   4   Consists of investment securities available for sale, investment securities held to maturity, and investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock.

Changes attributable to the combined effect of volume and interest rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to interest rates: 

Provision for Loan Losses  
  The provision for loan losses was $652,000 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $676,000 in the same period of 2015 and was $1.6 million and $1.4 million for the nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the provision for loan losses in the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily the result of an increase in adversely classified loans in 2016 and due to the Company's assessment of current economic conditions in our market. See "Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses" under the "Financial Condition-Balance Sheet Overview" and Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I of this report for more information on changes in the Company's Allowance. 
  Other Operating Income 
    Other operating income for the three-month period ending   September 30, 2016  , decreased $472,000, or 4%, to $11.9 million as compared to the same period in   2015  .  This decrease is primarily the result of a $613,000 decrease in other income mainly due to decreased gains on loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of Alaska Pacific Bancshares, Inc. ("Alaska Pacific") in 2014 at a discount to par values that were paid off in the third quarter of 2015. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $203,000 in mortgage banking income due to increased mortgage servicing revenue. 
  Other operating income for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016, decreased $1.6 million, or 5%, to $32.9 million as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of a $756,000 decrease in mortgage banking income mainly due to lower refinance activity in the first quarter of 2016 as compared to the first quarter of 2015, as well as a $749,000 decrease in other income primarily due to a decrease in gains on loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of Alaska Pacific Alaska Pacific in 2014 at a discount to par values that were paid off in 2015.  
  
   46 

Other Operating Expense 
    Other operating expense for the   third   quarter of   2016   increased $3.0 million, or 16%, to $21.2 million as compared to the same period in   2015  . The increase from the previous quarter was primarily the result of a change in the accounting treatment for the earn-out payments related to the acquisition of RML, including a correction for prior periods, that added $2.8 million to pre-tax expenses in the current quarter. Additionally, salaries and other personnel expense increased in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter of 2015 by $718,000 primarily due to  increased salary expense due to the addition of a new management position and a new marketing position at RML, normal annual salary increases, as well as increased originator commission expense due to increased production.  These increases were partially offset by a $184,000 decrease in OREO expense mostly due to increased gains on sales of OREO properties and a $141,000 decrease in insurance expense primarily due to a decrease in Keyman insurance expense. 
  Other operating expense for the first nine months of 2016 increased $3.5 million, or 6%, to $57.9 million as compared to the same period in 2015, mainly as a result of increased salaries and personnel expense combined with the effects of the one-time, non-cash accounting error correction during 2016. Compensation expense related to the RML acquisition payments increased $1.2 million primarily due to the change in accounting and the error correction discussed above.  Salaries and personnel expense increased $2.3 million during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, of which $1.3 million of this increase was attributable to the community banking segment.  The increase in salaries and personnel expense in the community banking segment for the first nine months of 2016 was primarily the result of higher medical costs, higher base salaries, and increases in various benefits costs including equity compensation and the estimated profit sharing payment for Northrim Bank employees for 2016.  The increase in salaries and personnel expense of approximately $1.0 million in the home mortgage lending segment in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period of 2015 was primarily due to the same items noted above for the change in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. These increases for the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 were partially offset by a decrease of $258,000 in OREO expense and a decrease of $231,000 in insurance expense in 2016 for the reasons outlined above.  
  Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes for the three and nine-month periods ending   September 30, 2016   decreased $1.7 million and $2.5 million or 62% and 35%, respectively, as compared to the same periods in   2015   primarily due to a decrease in pre-tax net income.  The effective tax rate for the three-month period ending September 30, 2016 decreased to 24% from 33% for the three-month period ending September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2016 decreased to 29% from 34% for the nine-month period ending September 30, 2015. The decrease in tax rate for both the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to increased tax credits as compared to 2015. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  Balance Sheet Overview 
  Investment Securities 
  Investment securities at   September 30, 2016   increased 3%, or $9.2 million, to $301.3 million from $292.0 million at   December 31, 2015  . The Company continues to reinvest proceeds from sales, maturities, and security calls in available for sale securities. The table below details portfolio investment balances by portfolio investment type: 
  
   47 

Loans and Lending Activities 
  Our loan products include short and medium-term commercial loans, commercial credit lines, construction and real estate loans, and consumer loans. From our inception, we have emphasized commercial, land development and home construction, and commercial real estate lending. This type of lending has provided us with market opportunities and higher net interest margins than other types of lending.  However, it also involves greater risks, including greater exposure to changes in local economic conditions, than certain other types of lending. 
  Portfolio loans increased by $16.3 million, or 2%, to $997.1 million at   September 30, 2016   from $980.8 million at   December 31, 2015  , primarily the result of increased real estate term loans relating to owner occupied properties, being partially offset by decreased real estate term loans relating to non-owner occupied properties in 2016. Real estate construction one-to-four family loans, which are mostly residential housing construction loans remained consistent at approximately 4% of portfolio loans at September 30, 2016.  
  The following table details loan balances by loan type as of the dates indicated:

Information about loans directly exposed to the oil and gas industry 
    
  The Company defines "direct exposure" to the oil and gas industry as companies that it has identified as significantly reliant upon activity related to the oil and gas industry, such as oilfield services, lodging, equipment rental, transportation, and other logistic services specific to the industry.  The Company currently has no loans to oil producers or exploration companies. The Company estimates that $51.9 million, or approximately 5% of loans as of September 30, 2016 have direct exposure to the oil and gas industry as compared to $47.3 million, or approximately 5% of loans as of December 31, 2015.  The Company's unfunded commitments to borrowers that have direct exposure to the oil and gas industry were $44.4 million and $48.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The portion of the Company's allowance for loan losses that related to the loans with direct exposure to the oil and gas industry was estimated at $1.3 million and $978,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
       
  The following table details loan balances by loan segment and class of financing receivable for loans with direct oil and gas exposure as of the dates indicated: 

Analysis of Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The Company maintains an Allowance to reflect losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  The Allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and loan recoveries and decreased by loan charge-offs.  The size of the Allowance is determined through quarterly assessments of probable estimated losses in the loan portfolio.   
  Our methodology for making such assessments and determining the adequacy of the Allowance includes the following key elements: 
  A specific allocation for impaired loans.    Management determines the fair value of the majority of these loans based on the underlying collateral values.  This analysis is based upon a specific analysis for each impaired loan, including external appraisals on loans secured by real property, management s assessment of the current market, recent payment history, and an evaluation of other sources of repayment.  In-house evaluations of fair value are used in the impairment analysis in some situations.  Inputs to the in-house evaluation process include information about sales of comparable properties in the appropriate markets and changes in tax assessed values.  The Company obtains appraisals on real and personal property that secure its loans during the loan origination process in accordance with regulatory guidance and its loan policy.  The Company obtains updated appraisals on loans secured by real or personal property based upon its assessment of changes in the current market or particular projects or properties, information from other current appraisals, and other sources of information.  Appraisals may be adjusted downward by the Company based on its evaluation of the facts and circumstances on a case by case basis.  External appraisals may be discounted when management believes that the absorption period used in the appraisal is unrealistic, when expected liquidation costs exceed those included in the appraisal, or when management s evaluation of deteriorating market conditions warrants an adjustment.  Additionally, the Company may also adjust appraisals in the above circumstances between appraisal dates.  The Company uses the information provided in these updated appraisals along with its evaluation of all other information available on a particular property as it assesses the collateral coverage on its performing and nonperforming loans and the impact that may have on the adequacy of its Allowance.  The specific allowance for impaired loans, as well as the overall Allowance, may increase based on the Company s assessment of updated appraisals.  When the Company determines that a loss has occurred on an impaired loan, a charge-off equal to the difference between carrying value and fair value is recorded.  If a specific allowance is deemed necessary for a loan, and then that loan is partially charged off, the loan remains classified as a nonperforming loan after the charge-off is recognized.  Loans measured for impairment based on collateral value and all other loans measured for impairment are accounted  
  
   49 

for in the same way.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , 20% and 48% of net nonperforming loans, which totaled $9.3 million and $2.1 million, respectively, had partially charged-off balances. The ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding during the third quarter of 2016 was negative 0.05% as compared to 0.03% during the same period in 2015. 
  A general allocation.    The Company has identified segments and classes of loans not considered impaired for purposes of establishing the general allocation allowance.  The Company determined the disaggregation of the loan portfolio into segments and classes based on its assessment of how different pools of loans with like characteristics in the portfolio behave over time.  This determination is based on historical experience and management s assessment of how current facts and circumstances are expected to affect the loan portfolio. 
  The Company has the following loan segments: commercial, real estate construction one-to-four family, real estate construction other, real estate term owner occupied, real estate term non-owner occupied, real estate term other, consumer secured by 1st deeds of trust, and other consumer loans.  The Company has five loan classes: pass, special mention, substandard, doubtful, and loss. 
  After the portfolio has been disaggregated into segments and classes, the Company calculates a general reserve for each segment and class based on the average year loss history for each segment and class using a five year look-back period.   
  After the Company calculates a general allocation using its loss history, the general reserve is then adjusted for qualitative factors by segment and class.  Qualitative factors are based on management s assessment of current trends that may cause losses inherent in the current loan portfolio to differ significantly from historical losses.  Some factors that management considers in determining the qualitative adjustment to the general reserve include loan quality trends in our own portfolio, national and local economic trends, business conditions, underwriting policies and standards, trends in local real estate markets, effects of various political activities, peer group data, and internal factors such as underwriting policies and expertise of the Company s employees. 
  An unallocated reserve.    The unallocated portion of the Allowance provides for other credit losses inherent in the Company s loan portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the specific and general components of the Allowance, and it acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models.  The unallocated component is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses and overall economic conditions. 
  The unallocated portion of the Allowance as a percentage of the total Allowance was 7% and 8% at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Further discussion of the enhancement to the Company s Allowance methodology can be found in Item 7 in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Allowance related to acquired loans:    In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, loans acquired in connection with the acquisition of Alaska Pacific on April 1, 2014 were recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.  Credit discounts were included in the determination of fair value; therefore, an allowance for loan losses was not recorded at the acquisition date.  Purchased credit impaired loans were evaluated on a loan by loan basis and the valuation allowance for these loans was netted against the carrying value.  Deterioration in credit quality of the acquired loans subsequent to acquisition date results in the establishments of an allowance.  Management assesses credit impairment for the loans that were acquired from Alaska Pacific as part of the on-going monitoring of the credit quality of the Company s entire loan portfolio. Management tracks certain credit quality indicators including trends in past due and nonaccrual loans, gross and net charge offs, and movement in loan balances within the risk classifications.  As of September 30, 2016, $992,000 of the original $141.5 million of purchased loans, or 0.70%, had migrated from pass grade loans to substandard loans. As of December 31, 2015, $1.0 million of the original $141.5 million of purchased loans, or 0.73%, had migrated from pass grade loans to substandard loans. These loans are included in impaired loans as of September 30, 2016, and have been evaluated for specific impairment as part of the calculation of the Allowance. There was no specific impairment on these loans at December 31, 2015 or September 30, 2016.  There was no Allowance related to acquired loans at September 30, 2016. 
  
   50 

The following table sets forth information regarding changes in the Allowance for the periods indicated: 

While management believes that it uses the best information available to determine the Allowance, unforeseen market conditions and other events could result in adjustment to the Allowance, and net income could be significantly affected if circumstances differed substantially from the assumptions used in making the final determination of the Allowance.  Moreover, bank regulators frequently monitor banks' loan loss allowances, and if regulators were to determine that the Company s Allowance is inadequate, they may require the Company to increase the Allowance, which may adversely impact the Company s net income and financial condition. 
  Deposits 
  Deposits are the Company s primary source of funds.  Total deposits increased $37.6 million, or 3%, to $1.3 billion at September 30, 2016 from $1.2 billion at   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The following table summarizes the Company's composition of deposits as of the periods indicated: 

The Company s mix of deposits continues to contribute to a low cost of funds with balances in transaction accounts representing 90% and 89% of total deposits   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  The only deposit category with stated maturity dates is certificates of deposit.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had $130.0 million in certificates of deposit as compared to certificates of deposit of $136.7 million at   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , $88.9 million, or 69%, of the Company s certificates of deposits are scheduled to mature over the next 12 months as compared to $87.3 million, or 64%, of total certificates of deposit at   December 31, 2015  . The aggregate amount of certificates of deposit in amounts of $100,000 and greater at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , was $82.5 million and $84.2 million, respectively. The following table sets forth the amount outstanding of deposits in amounts of $100,000 and greater by time remaining until maturity and percentage of total deposits as of   September 30, 2016  : 

51 

There were no depositors with deposits representing 10% or more of total deposits at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Borrowings 
    FHLB.   The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines (the "FHLB"). As a member, the Bank is eligible to obtain advances from the FHLB. FHLB advances are dependent on the availability of acceptable collateral such as marketable securities or real estate loans, although all FHLB advances are secured by a blanket pledge of the Company's assets. At September 30, 2016, our maximum borrowing line from the FHLB was $539.0 million, approximating 35% of eligible assets, subject to the FHLB's collateral requirements. The Company has outstanding FHLB advances totaling $4.4 million and $2.1 million as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively which are included in borrowings.  These advances were originated to match fund low income housing projects that qualify for long term fixed interest rates.  The first advance is a $2.2 million FHLB Community Investment Program advance that has an eighteen year term with a 30 year amortization period and a fixed interest rate of 3.12%, that mirrors the term of the loan made to the borrower. The other advance is a $2.3 million FHLB Community Investment Cash Advance Program advance that was originated in the second quarter of 2016. This advance has a twenty year term with a 30 year amortization period and a fixed interest rate of 2.61%, that mirrors the term of the loan made to the borrower. 
    
    Other Short-term Borrowings.   Securities sold under agreements to repurchase were $27.7 million and $31.4 million, for September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The average balance outstanding of securities sold under agreements to repurchase during the three month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $26.7 million and $27.0 million, respectively, and $26.8 million and $20.5 million, respectively, during the nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015. The maximum outstanding at any month-end was $27.7 million and $33.4 million, respectively, during the three month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015 and $28.2 million and $33.4 million, respectively, for the nine month periods ending September 30, 2016 and 2015. The approximate weighted average interest rate for outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase was 0.11% and 0.10% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and 0.11% and 0.10% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The securities sold under agreements to repurchase are held by the FHLB under the Company's control. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had no short-term (original maturity of one year or less) borrowings that exceeded 30% of shareholders  equity. 
  The Company is subject to further regulatory standards issued by the State of Alaska which limit the amount of outstanding debt to 15% of total assets or $231.0 million and $224.9 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  Long-term Borrowings.   The Company had no long-term borrowing outstanding other than the FHLB advance noted above as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.     
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The Company is a single bank holding company and its primary ongoing source of liquidity is from dividends received from Northrim Bank (the "Bank"). Such dividends arise from the cash flow and earnings of the Bank. Banking regulations and regulatory authorities may limit the amount of, or require the Bank to obtain certain approvals before paying, dividends to the Company. Given that the Bank currently meets and the Bank anticipates that they will continue to meet, all applicable capital adequacy requirements for a  well-capitalized  institution by regulatory standards, the Company expects to continue to receive  
  
   52 

dividends from the Bank during 2016. Beginning in 2016, a requirement to have a conservation buffer will start being phased in and this requirement could adversely affect the Bank's ability to pay dividends. 
  The Company manages its liquidity through its Asset and Liability Committee. Our primary sources of funds are customer deposits and advances from the FHLB. These funds, together with loan repayments, loan sales, other borrowed funds, retained earnings, and equity are used to make loans, to acquire securities and other assets, and to fund deposit flows and continuing operations. The primary sources of demands on our liquidity are customer demands for withdrawal of deposits and borrowers' demands that we advance funds against unfunded lending commitments. Our total unfunded commitments to fund loans and letters of credit at September 30, 2016 were $231.6 million. We do not expect that all of these loans are likely to be fully drawn upon at any one time. Additionally, as noted above, our total deposits at September 30, 2016 were $1.3 billion. 
  As shown in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included in Part I - Item 1 "Financial Statements" of this report, net cash used in operating activities was $17.7 million for the first nine months of 2016 primarily due to cash used in the connection with the origination of loans held for sale being partially offset by the cash proceeds received in connection with net sales of loans held for sale. Net cash used by investing activities was $27.0 million for the same period, primarily due to cash used to fund increased net loans and purchases of investment securities available for sale being partially offset by cash provided by the proceeds from calls, sales, and maturities of available for sale securities.  Net cash provided by financing activities was $31.9 million, primarily due to cash provided by an increase in deposits being partially offset by cash used in connection with a decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements. 
  The sources by which we meet the liquidity needs of our customers are current assets and borrowings available through our correspondent banking relationships and our credit lines with the Federal Reserve Bank and the FHLB. At September 30, 2016, our funds available for borrowing under our existing lines of credit were $  611.5 million  . 
  Given these sources of liquidity and our expectations for customer demands for cash and for our operating cash needs, we believe our sources of liquidity to be sufficient to fund our ongoing operating activities and our anticipated capital requirements for at least 12 months. 
  The Company issued 5,342 shares of its common stock in the first nine months of   2016   and did not repurchase any shares of its common stock under the Company s publicly announced repurchase program. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had 6,882,482 shares of its common stock outstanding. 
  Capital Requirements and Ratios 
  The Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank, are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements can result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material adverse effect on the Company's financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about the components of regulatory capital, risk weightings, and other factors.  The regulatory agencies may establish higher minimum requirements if, for example, a bank or bank holding company has previously received special attention or has a high susceptibility to interest rate risk. 
  Effective January 1, 2015, both the Company and the Bank were required to meet more stringent minimum capital requirements standards, commonly referred to as  Basel III .  Effective January 1, 2016, the conservation buffer is beginning to be phased in. 
  The requirements address both risk-based capital and leverage capital.  At   September 30, 2016  , all capital ratios of the Company and the Bank exceeded the ratios required for a  well-capitalized  institution under regulatory guidelines. 
  
   53 

The following table sets forth the actual capital ratios for the Company and the Bank as calculated under regulatory guidelines, compared to the regulatory minimum capital ratios and the regulatory minimum capital ratios needed to be eligible to qualify as a  well-capitalized  institution as of   September 30, 2016  . 

The regulatory capital ratios for the Company exceed those for the Bank in certain categories primarily because the $18.6 million junior subordinated debenture offerings that the Company completed in the third quarter of 2003 and the fourth quarter of 2005 are included in the Company s capital for regulatory purposes although such securities are accounted for as a long-term debt in its financial statements.  The junior subordinated debentures are not accounted for on the Bank s financial statements nor are they included in its capital.  As a result, the Company has $18.6 million more in regulatory capital than the Bank. 
    Off-Balance Sheet Items 
  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk.  Among the off-balance sheet items entered into in the ordinary course of business are commitments to extend credit and the issuance of letters of credit.  These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the balance sheet.  Certain commitments are collateralized.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s commitments to extend credit and to provide letters of credit which are not reflected on its balance sheet amounted to $231.6 million and $228.8 million, respectively.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, these total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  The Company has established reserves of $112,000 at September 30, 2016 and $114,000 at December 31, 2015, for losses related to these commitments that are recorded in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
  Capital Expenditures and Commitments 
  The Company entered into a contract with a new core banking systems vendor in the third quarter of 2016.  Conversion to the new system is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2017.  Operating costs after conversion to the new system are expected to remain relatively consistent with current operating costs; however, the Company expects to temporarily incur increased costs during the period of conversion primarily due to a temporary increase in staffing levels in order to facilitate a successful conversion.  There were no other material changes outside of the ordinary course of business to any of our material contractual obligations during the third quarter of 2016. 
  At   September 30, 2016   the Company has capital commitments of $83,000 related to planned improvements to the Company s corporate office building.  The Company expects these capital expenditures to be incurred in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    Our assessment of market risk as of   September 30, 2016   indicates that there are no material changes in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures from those in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  
   54 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Our principal executive and financial officers supervised and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive and financial officers each concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , the disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in the periodic reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The design of any system of controls is based in part upon various assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any of our plans, products, services or procedures will succeed in achieving their intended goals under future conditions. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Disclosure and Reporting 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15-d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the quarterly period ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  During the normal course of its business, the Company is a party to various debtor-creditor legal actions, disputes, claims, and litigation related to the conduct of its banking business.  These include cases filed as a plaintiff in collection and foreclosure cases, and the enforcement of creditors  rights in bankruptcy proceedings.  Management does not expect that the resolution of these matters will have a material effect on the Company s business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. 
   
  ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS 
  For information regarding risk factors, please refer to Item 1A in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  These risk factors have not materially changed as of   September 30, 2016  .

 EXHIBIT 10.1

Exhibit 

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT 
  THIS AGREEMENT (the  Agreement ) is made and entered into effective the 25th day of August, 2016 (the  Effective Date ), by and between NORTHRIM BANCORP, INC. and its wholly owned subsidiary, NORTHRIM BANK, a state chartered commercial bank, with its principal office in Anchorage, Alaska (collectively, the  Employer ), and   Latosha M.

  1.        Employment. 
  Employer employs Executive and Executive accepts employment with Employer as its   Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer.

  The term of this Agreement (the  Term ) shall commence on the Effective Date and, unless terminated earlier pursuant to Section 5, shall continue through December 31, 2016;   provided, however  , that on January 1, 2017 and each succeeding January 1, the Term shall automatically be extended for one (1) additional year unless, not later than ninety (90) days prior to any such January 1, either party shall have given written notice to the other that it does not wish to extend the Term.  In the event the Term is not extended, Executive shall have no rights to any of the severance payments or benefits continuation described in Section 5 except as specifically provided for in Section 5.a.   
  3.        Duties. 
  The Executive will serve as   Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer   of the Employer.  Executive shall render such executive, management and administrative services and perform such tasks in connection with the affairs and overall operation of the Employer as is customary for her position, subject to the direction of Employer s President and Board of Directors.  Executive shall devote necessary time, attention and effort to Employer s business in order to properly discharge her responsibilities under this Agreement. 
  4.        Compensation, Benefits, Reimbursement and Profit Sharing. 
  a.        Base Salary  .    In consideration for all services rendered by Executive during the term of this Agreement, Employer shall pay Executive an annual base salary (before all customary and proper payroll deductions) of   $237,000   as adjusted from time to time ( Base Salary ).  The Board of Directors of the Employer shall review Executive s salary each year, in a manner consistent with that used for all management employees of the Employer, and in its sole discretion may adjust such salary commensurate with the Executive s performance under this Agreement. 
  b.        Profit Sharing Plan  .    Under the Northrim BanCorp, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan, Executive shall be eligible to receive an annual profit share ( Profit Share ) based on performance as defined by the Board of Directors.  Executive will be classified in the Executive Vice President tier under the Plan s Responsibility Factors.  If Employer is required to prepare an accounting restatement due to  material noncompliance of the Employer , the Employer will recover from the Executive any incentive compensation during the three (3) years prior to the date of the restatement, in excess of what would have been paid under the restatement.  Executive s signature on this Agreement authorizes Employer to offset or deduct from any  

compensation Employer may owe Executive, any excess payments (in whole or in part) that Executive may owe Employer due to such restatement(s).   
  c.        Stock Incentive Plan  .    Executive shall be eligible for awards under the Employer s Stock Incentive Plan.  The type, timing and size of awards will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors. 
  d.        Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP ) and Deferred Compensation Plan  .

The Executive may also participate in the Employer s Deferred Compensation Plan. 
  e.        Other Benefits  .    Throughout the term of this Agreement, Employer shall provide Executive with reasonable health insurance, disability and other employee benefits.

  f.        Expenses  .    Employer shall reimburse Executive for her reasonable expenses (including, without limitation, travel, entertainment, and similar expenses) incurred in performing and promoting the business of Employer.  Executive shall present from time to time itemized accounts and receipts of any such expenses as required by Employer, subject to any limits of company policy and the rules and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service, including the Internal Revenue Code, (referred to throughout this Agreement as  IRC  or the  Code ). 
  5.        Termination of Agreement. 
  a.        Termination Due to a Change of Control  .    If (A) Employer (either Northrim BanCorp, Inc. or Northrim Bank) is subjected to a Change of Control (as defined in Section 5.f.(i)), and (B) either Employer or its assigns terminates Executive s employment without Cause (either during the annual term of this Agreement or by refusing to extend this Agreement when the annual termination occurs every December 31) or Executive terminates her employment for Good Reason within 730 days of such Change of Control, then Employer shall pay Executive (i) all Base Salary earned and all reimbursable expenses incurred under this Agreement through such termination date; (ii) an amount equal to two (2) times Executive s highest Base Salary over the prior three (3) years; and (iii) an amount equal to two (2) times Executive s average Profit Share over the prior three (3) year period.  The amounts described in Section 5.a.(i), (ii) and (iii) herein shall be paid no later than forty-five (45) days after the day on which employment is terminated.  No payment will be made pursuant to Sections 5.a.(ii) and (iii) unless the Executive has signed an agreement, in a form acceptable to Employer, that releases and holds Employer harmless from all known and unknown claims and liabilities arising out of Executive s employment with Employer or the performance of this Agreement ( Release Agreement ) and the Release Agreement has become irrevocable prior to the payment date. 
    (I)        Benefits Continuation.      In addition, Executive shall be entitled to health and dental insurance benefits for a period of two (2) years following the termination of this Agreement.  These benefits will be provided at Employer s expense, but such period shall count towards the Employer s continuation of coverage obligation under Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code (commonly referred to as  COBRA ). 
    (II)        Age and Service Credit.      Executive shall also be entitled to receive age credit and credit for period of service towards all SERP plans for the remaining period of time covered by this Agreement.  If Executive is hired by Employer, its assigns, any company in control of Employer, or any  

company controlled by Employer during the period covered by this Agreement, then Executive will be entitled to be treated for all purposes relating to future compensation, and benefits, as if this Agreement had never been terminated and as if Executive had performed her responsibilities as an Executive throughout the period originally covered by this Agreement. 
  b.        Termination by Employer Without Cause or by Executive for Good Reason  .    If Employer terminates Executive s employment without Cause, or if Executive terminates her employment for Good Reason, Employer shall pay Executive in a lump sum: (i) all Base Salary earned and all reimbursable expenses incurred under this Agreement through such termination date; and (ii) an amount equal to one (1) times Executive s highest Base Salary over the prior three (3) years.  The amount described in 5.b.(i) herein shall be paid no later than forty-five (45) days after the day on which employment is terminated.  The amount described in 5.b.(ii) herein shall be paid on the first day of the month following a period of six (6) months after the termination of employment, provided that the payment may be made sooner if either (i) the amount does not exceed the IRC Safe Harbor or (ii) at the Executive s election, the amount described in Section 5.a.(ii) is reduced to fit within the IRC Safe Harbor.  No payment will be made pursuant to Section 5.a.(ii) unless the Executive has signed a Release Agreement which has become irrevocable prior to the payment date.   
    (I)        Benefits Continuation.      In addition, Executive shall be entitled to health and dental insurance benefits for a period of twelve (12) months following the termination of this Agreement.  These benefits will be provided at Employer s expense, but such period shall count towards the Employer s continuation of coverage obligation under Section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code (commonly referred to as  COBRA ). 
    (II)        Age and Service Credit.      If Executive is hired by Employer, its assigns, any company in control of Employer, or any company controlled by Employer during the period covered by this Agreement, then Executive will be entitled to be treated for all purposes relating to future compensation, and benefits, as if this Agreement had never been terminated and as if Executive had performed her responsibilities as an Executive throughout the period originally covered by this Agreement. 
  c.        Termination by Employer for Cause or by Executive Without Good Reason  .    If Employer terminates Executive s employment for Cause or if Executive terminates her employment without Good Reason, Employer shall pay Executive upon the effective date of such termination only such Base Salary earned and expenses reimbursable under this Agreement incurred through such termination date.  In such case, Executive shall have no right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after termination under this Agreement.   
  d.        Termination Due to Disability  .    If Employer terminates Executive s employment on account of any mental or physical Disability that prevents Executive from performing her essential job functions, even with reasonable accommodation, Executive shall be entitled to: (i) all Base Salary earned and reimbursement for expenses incurred under this Agreement through the termination date, (ii) full Base Salary for the year following the termination date (less the amount of any payments received by Executive during such one (1) year period under any Employer sponsored disability plan), and (iii) health and dental insurance benefits for a period of one (1) year following the termination date, which benefits will be provided at Employer s expense, but such period shall count towards the Employer s continuation of coverage obligation under Section 4980B of Code (commonly referred to as  COBRA ).  All such compensation shall be paid Executive in one (1) lump sum the first day of the month following a period of six (6) months after Executive s employment was terminated, provided that Executive has signed a Release Agreement which has become irrevocable prior to the payment date. 

If any disputed termination under Section 5.c. is subsequently determined to have been without Cause, Executive's recovery shall be limited to those payments and benefits set out under Section 5.b.  
  e.        Termination Upon Death of Executive  .    Executive s employment under this Agreement shall be terminated upon the death of Executive.  In such case, the Employer shall be obligated to pay to the surviving spouse of Executive, or if there is none, to the Executive s estate: (i) that portion of Executive s Base Salary that would otherwise have been paid to him for the month in which her death occurred, and (ii) any amounts due her pursuant to the Northrim Bank Savings Incentive Plan (401-K) and the Northrim BanCorp, Inc. Profit Sharing Plan, any supplemental deferred compensation plan, and any other death, insurance, employee benefit plan or stock benefit plan provided to Executive by the Employer, according to the terms of the respective plans. 
  f.        Termination Definitions  . 
  (i)           Change of Control.       For purposes of this Agreement, the term  Change of Control  shall mean the occurrence of one or more of the following events: (A) one (1) person or entity acquiring or otherwise becoming the owner of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of Employer s outstanding common stock; (B) replacement of a majority of the incumbent directors of Northrim BanCorp, Inc. or Northrim Bank by directors whose elections have not been supported by a majority of the Board of either company, as appropriate; (C) dissolution or sale of fifty percent (50%) or more in value of the assets, of either Northrim BanCorp, Inc. or Northrim Bank; or (D) a change  in the ownership or effective control  or  in the ownership of a substantial portion of the assets  of Employer, within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code. 
  (ii)           Cause.       For purposes of this Agreement, termination for  Cause  shall include termination because Executive: (A) continually fails to substantially perform her duties with the Employer; (B) is adjudged guilty of a felony, any crime involving dishonesty or breach of trust or any crime involving a breach of her fiduciary duties to the Employer; (C) is willfully and continually failing to comply with any law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease and desist order of a regulatory agency having jurisdiction over Employer; (D) commits a material act of dishonesty or disloyalty related to the business of the Employer; or (E) is unable to substantially perform her duties with the Employer due to drug addiction or chronic alcoholism.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be deemed to have been terminated for Cause unless and until there shall have been delivered to her a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than three quarters (3/4) of the entire membership of the Employer s Board of Directors at a meeting of the Board called for such purpose (after reasonable notice to Executive and an opportunity for her, together with her counsel, to be heard before the Board), finding that in the good faith opinion of the Board, she was guilty of conduct that constitutes Cause (as defined above) and specifying the conduct in detail. 
  (iii)         Disability.     For purposes of this Agreement,  Disability  shall mean a medically diagnosed physical or mental impairment that may be expected to result in death, or to be of long, continued duration, and that renders Executive incapable of performing her essential job functions under this Agreement, even after she has been accorded reasonable accommodation.  Employer s Board of Directors, acting in good faith, in accordance with applicable law, shall make the final determination of whether Executive is suffering under any Disability (as herein defined) and, for purposes of making such determination, may require Executive to submit herself to a physical examination by a physician mutually agreed upon by the Executive and Employer s Board of Directors at Employer s expense. 
  (iv)         Good Reason.     For purposes of this Agreement, termination for  Good Reason  shall mean termination by Executive as a result of any material breach of this Agreement by  

Employer.  Good Reason shall include, but not be limited to: (A) a material reduction in Executive s compensation defined as a reduction equal to or greater than five percent (5%) of Executive s then annual base salary; (B) a material reduction in Executive s duties and responsibilities, but not merely a change in title; or (C) relocation of Executive s primary workplace by more than fifty (50) miles.   Good Reason  will only be deemed to occur if, within ninety (90) days after a material reduction or change described above first occurs, the Executive provides notice to the Employer of the existence of Good Reason and of the Executive s intended termination of employment due to Good Reason, and the Employer does not remove the Good Reason condition within ninety (90) days after receiving such notice from the Executive.  The Executive s written notice must explain the basis on which the Executive believes Good Reason exists, the cure period, and the date on which the Executive intends to terminate employment, which must be no later than six (6) months     after the existence of the Good Reason.  The provisions of Section 5.f.(iv) are intended to comply with the Good Reason safe harbor provisions of Code Section 409A and applicable regulations. 
  (v)        Termination from Employment.    A termination from employment under this Agreement shall mean a    Separation from Service    as interpreted in accordance with Code Section 409A and generally meaning the date on which the Executive is no longer performing services for the Employer.  The Executive shall not have a Separation from Service while on military leave, sick leave, or other bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six (6) months, or if longer, so long as the Executive retains a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or contract.  A leave of absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence only if there is a reasonable expectation that the Executive will return to perform services.  
  6.        Limit on Severance Payment for Change of Control. 
  Notwithstanding anything above in Section 5.a., if the severance payment provided for in that Section, together with any other payments which the Executive has the right to receive from the Employer, would constitute a  parachute payment  (as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code), the severance payment shall be reduced.  The reduction shall be in an amount so that the present value of the total amount received by the Executive from the Employer or its affiliates and subsidiaries will be 2.99 times the Executive s base amount (as defined in Section 280G of the Code) and so that no portion of the amounts received by the Executive shall be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (excise tax).  Insofar as permitted by the Code, Employer shall reduce those elements of the severance pay package specified by the Executive.  The determination as to whether any reduction in the severance payment is necessary shall be made by the Employer in good faith, and the determination shall be conclusive and binding on Executive.  If through error or otherwise Executive should receive payments under this Plan, together with other payments the Executive has the right to receive from the Employer, in excess of 2.99 times her base amount, Executive shall immediately repay the excess to Employer upon notification that an overpayment has been made. 
  7.        Covenant Not To Compete. 
  a.        Executive agrees that for the term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 5.a. or 5.b., Executive will not directly or indirectly be employed by, own, manage, operate, support, join, or benefit in any way from any business activity within the states where Employer operates that is competitive with Employer s business or reasonably anticipated business of which Executive has knowledge.  For purposes of the foregoing, Executive will be deemed to be connected with such business if the business is carried on by: (i) a partnership in which Executive is a general or limited partner; or (ii) a corporation of which Executive is a shareholder (other than a shareholder owning less than five percent (5%) of the total outstanding shares of the corporation), officer, director, employee or consultant, whether paid or unpaid.  In the event of an alleged breach by Executive of this Section 7, the one-year non-compete period shall be extended until such breach or violation has been duly  

cured, and shall restart so that Employer has received the intended benefit of one (1) uninterrupted year of non-competition by Executive. 
  b.        The parties agree that if a trial judge with jurisdiction over a dispute related to this Agreement should determine that the restrictive covenant set forth above is unreasonably broad, the parties authorize such trial judge to narrow the covenant so as to make it reasonable, given all relevant circumstances, and to enforce such covenant.  The provisions of this Section 7 shall survive termination of this Agreement. 
  8.        Nondisclosure of Confidential Information. 
  a.        During the term of Executive s employment and thereafter, Executive agrees to hold Employer s Confidential Information in strict confidence, and not disclose or use it at any time except as authorized by Employer and for Employer s benefit.  If anyone tries to compel Executive to disclose any Confidential Information, by subpoena or otherwise, Executive agrees immediately to notify Employer so that Employer may take any actions it deems necessary to protect its interests.  Executive s agreement to protect Employer s Confidential Information applies both during the term of this Agreement and after employment ends, regardless of the reason it ends. 
  b.         Confidential Information  includes, without limitation, any information in whatever form that Employer considers to be confidential, proprietary, information and that is not publicly or generally available relating to Employer s: trade secrets (as defined by the Uniform Trade Secrets Act), know-how, concepts, methods, research and development, product, content and technology development plans, marketing plans, databases, inventions, research data and mechanisms, software (including functional specifications, source code and object code), procedures, engineering, purchasing, accounting, marketing, sales, customers, advertisers, joint venture partners, suppliers, financial status, contracts or employees.  Confidential Information includes information developed by Executive, alone or with others, or entrusted to Employer by its customers or others. 
  9.        Non-Solicitation. 
  During the course of Executive s employment and for a period of one (1) year from the date of termination of employment for any reason, Executive shall not directly or indirectly solicit or entice any of the following to cease, terminate or reduce any relationship with Employer or to divert any business from Employer: (a) any person who was an employee of Employer during the one (1) year period immediately preceding the termination of Executive s employment; (b) any customer or client of Employer; or (c) any prospective customer or client of Employer from whom Executive actively solicited business within the last one (1) year of Executive s employment.  In the event of an alleged breach by Executive of this Section 9, the one (1) year non-solicitation period shall be extended until such breach or violation has been duly cured, and shall restart so that Employer has received the intended benefit of one (1) uninterrupted year of non-solicitation by Executive. 
  10.        Non-Disparagement.     
  Executive will not, during the Term or after the termination or expiration of this Agreement or Executive s employment, make disparaging statements, in any form, about Employer s officers, directors, agents, employees, products or services which Executive knows, or has reason to believe, are false or misleading. 

11.        Mutual Agreement to Arbitrate. 
  a.        Except as provided in Section 11.b., in the event of a dispute or claim between Executive and Employer related to Employee s employment or termination of employment, all such disputes or claims will be resolved exclusively by confidential arbitration in accordance with the National Rules for the Resolution of Employment Disputes of the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ).  This means that the parties agree to waive their rights to have such disputes or claims decided in court by a jury.  Instead, such disputes or claims will be resolved by an impartial AAA arbitrator whose decision will be final.   
  b.        The only disputes or claims that are not subject to arbitration are any claims by Executive for workers  compensation or unemployment benefits, and any claim by Executive for benefits under an employee benefit plan that provides its own arbitration procedure.  Also, Executive and Employer may seek equitable relief (such as an injunction or declaratory relief) in court in appropriate circumstances.  Specifically, Executive recognizes that Employer does not have an adequate remedy at law to protect its business from Executive s breach of Sections 7, 8, or 9 of this Agreement, and therefore Employer shall be entitled to bring an action for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunctive relief pre-arbitration, in the event of any actual or threatened breach by Executive of Sections 7, 8, or 9.  In such court proceeding, Employer shall not be required to post a bond or other security, and Employer may also be awarded actual damages caused by Executive s breach of Sections 7, 8, or 9 of this Agreement as well as repayment of all or a portion of any severance that Employer previously paid to Executive.    
  c.        Except as provided by section 11.b., the arbitration procedure will afford Executive and Employer the full range of legal, equitable, and/or statutory remedies.  Employer will pay all costs that are unique to arbitration, except that the party who initiates arbitration will pay the filing fee charged by AAA.  Executive and Employer shall be entitled to discovery sufficient to adequately arbitrate their claims, including access to essential documents and witnesses, as determined by the arbitrator and subject to limited judicial review.  In order for any judicial review of the arbitrator s decision to be successfully accomplished, the arbitrator will issue a written decision that will decide all issues submitted and will reveal the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based.   
  12.        Miscellaneous. 
  a.        This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to Executive s employment with Employer, and is subject to modification or amendment only upon agreement in writing signed by both parties. 
  b.        This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties, except that Employer s rights and obligations may not be assigned. 
  c.        If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, then such provision shall be modified so as to be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by law.  If such provision cannot be modified to be enforceable, the provision shall be severed from the Agreement to the extent it is unenforceable.  All other provisions and any partially enforceable provisions shall remain unaffected and shall remain in full force and effect. 
  d.        In the event of any claim or dispute arising out of this Agreement, the party that substantially prevails shall be entitled to reimbursement of all expenses incurred in connection with such claim or dispute, including, without limitation, attorneys  fees and other professional fees.  This paragraph shall apply to expenses incurred with or without suit, and in any judicial, arbitration or administrative proceedings, including all appeals therefrom. 

e.        Any notice required to be given under this Agreement to either party shall be given by personal service (i.e., via hand delivery) or by depositing a copy of such notice in the United States registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the following address, or such other address as addressee shall designate in writing: 
    
  Employer:         
    
  3111  C  Street 
  Anchorage, AK  99503 
    
  Executive:       
    
  Address on file with Northrim BanCorp, Inc. Human Resources Department. 
    
  f.        This Agreement shall in all respects, including all matters of construction, validity and performance, be governed by and construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Alaska. 
  g.        This Agreement is intended to comply and shall be interpreted and construed in a manner consistent with the provisions of Internal Revenue Code Section 409A, including any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder.  In the event that any provision of the Agreement would cause a benefit or amount provided hereunder to be subject to tax under the Internal Revenue Code prior to the time such amount is paid, such provision shall, without the necessity of further action by the signatories to this Agreement, be null and void as of the Effective Date. 
  h  .        Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, no payment of any type or amount of compensation or benefits shall be made or owed by Employer to Executive pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise to the extent that payment of such type or amount is restricted or prohibited by, is not permitted under, or has not received any required approval under, any applicable federal or state statute, regulation, rule, policy, order, opinion, interpretation or similar issuance, whether now in existence or hereafter adopted or imposed, including without limitation any provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act or regulations promulgated thereunder, 12 USC 1828(k) or 12 CFR Part 359.  In the event that any payment made to Executive hereunder, under any prior employment agreement or arrangement or otherwise is required under any applicable federal or state statute, regulation, rule, policy, order, opinion, interpretation or similar issuance or under any agreement with or policy or plan of Employer to be paid back to Employer, Executive shall upon written demand from Employer promptly pay such amount back to Employer.
