Disclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  Brown   Brown, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (collectively,  we,   Brown   Brown  or the  Company ), makes  forward-looking statements  within the  safe harbor  provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended, throughout this report and in the documents we incorporate by reference into this report. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as  may,   will,   should,   expect,   anticipate,   believe,   intend,   estimate,   plan  and  continue  or similar words. We have based these statements on our current expectations about potential future events. Although we believe the expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and the reports, statements, information and announcements incorporated by reference into this report are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business, a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements, whether oral or written, made by us or on our behalf. Many of these factors have previously been identified in filings or statements made by us or on our behalf. Important factors which could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements in this report include but are not limited to the following items, in addition to those matters described in Part I, Item 2  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations : 

Future prospects;  
                
    Material adverse changes in economic conditions in the markets we serve and in the general economy;  
                
    Downward pressure on commercial property and casualty premiums or employee benefits premiums; 
                
    Future regulatory actions and conditions in the states in which we conduct our business; 
                
    The occurrence of adverse economic conditions, an adverse regulatory climate, or a disaster in California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia and Washington, because a significant portion of business written by us is for customers located in these states; 
                
    Our ability to attract, retain and enhance qualified personnel; 
                
    Competition from others in or entering into the insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and service business; 
                
    The integration of our operations with those of businesses or assets we have acquired or may acquire in the future and the failure to realize the expected benefits of such integration; 
                
    Risks that could negatively affect our acquisition strategy, including continuing consolidation among insurance intermediaries and the increasing presence of private equity investors driving up valuations; 
                
    Exposure units, and premium rates set by insurance companies which have traditionally varied and are difficult to predict; 
                
    Our ability to forecast liquidity needs through at least the end of 2017; 
                
    Our ability to renew or replace expiring leases; 
                
    Outcomes of existing or future legal proceedings and governmental investigations; 
                
    Policy cancellations and renewal terms, which can be unpredictable; 
                
    Potential changes to the tax rate that would affect the value of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the impact on income available for investment or distributable to shareholders; 
                
    The inherent uncertainty in making estimates, judgments, and assumptions in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP  
                
    Our ability to effectively utilize technology in providing improved value for our customers or carrier partners as well as applying effective internal controls and efficiencies in operations; and 
                
    Other risks and uncertainties as may be detailed from time to time in our public announcements and Securities and Exchange Commission filings. 
     Assumptions as to any of the foregoing and all statements are not based on historical fact, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future results and events. Forward-looking statements that we make or that are made by others on our behalf are based on a knowledge of our business and the environment in which we operate, but because of the factors listed above, among others, actual results may differ from those in the forward-looking statements. Consequently, these cautionary statements qualify all of the forward-looking statements we make herein. We cannot assure you that the results or developments anticipated by us will be realized or, even if substantially realized, that those results or developments will result in the expected consequences for us or affect us, our business or our operations in the way we expect. We caution readers not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of their dates. We assume no obligation to update any of the forward-looking statements.

BROWN   BROWN, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (UNAUDITED) 
   
  NOTE 1  Nature of Operations 
  Brown   Brown, Inc., a Florida corporation, and its subsidiaries (collectively,  Brown   Brown  or the  Company ) is a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and services organization that markets and sells to its customers, insurance products and services, primarily in the property and casualty area. Brown   Brown s business is divided into   four   reportable segments: the Retail Segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public entity, professional and individual customers; the National Programs Segment, acting as a managing general agent ( MGA ), provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals, a range of insurance products for individuals, flood coverage, and targeted products and services designated for specific industries, trade groups, governmental entities and market niches, all of which are delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents, and Brown   Brown retail agents; the Wholesale Brokerage Segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers, as well as Brown   Brown Retail offices; and the Services Segment provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers  compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as Medicare Set-aside services, Social Security disability and Medicare benefits advocacy services, and claims adjusting services. Since May 2014, we have owned a flood insurance carrier, Wright National Flood Insurance Company ( Wright Flood ). Wright Flood s business consists of policies written pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Program of the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ), and several excess flood insurance policies, all of which are fully reinsured. 
   
  NOTE 2  Basis of Financial Reporting 
  The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP for interim financial information and with the instructions for Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. These unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements and the Notes thereto set forth in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs". The guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts, and not recorded as a separate asset. The reason for the change is to align the treatment of debt issuance costs and debt discounts so that both reduce the carrying value of the liability. In August 2015, the FASB clarified that its guidance does not apply to line-of credit arrangements. This guidance requires retrospective application and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2016, as required. As a result, the Company retrospectively applied the guidance to the 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet by reclassifying   $8.3 million   from other assets to long-term debt.  
  The Company has condensed the presentation of non-cash stock based compensation into the employee compensation and benefits line. The non-cash stock based compensation shown in the 2015 Consolidated Statement of Income was   $15.5 million   for the full year.  
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)": Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force) ("ASU 2016-15"), which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified and applies to all entities, including both business entities and not-for-profit entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. ASU 2016-15 will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

     Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, "Principal Versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross Versus Net)" ("ASU 2016-08") to clarify certain aspects of the principal-versus-agent guidance included in the new revenue standard ASU 2014-09 "Revenue from Contracts with Customers" ("ASU 2014-09"). The FASB issued the ASU in response to concerns identified by stakeholders, including those related to (1) determining the appropriate unit of account under the revenue standard s principal-versus-agent guidance and (2) applying the indicators of whether an entity is a principal or an agent in accordance with the revenue standard s control principle. ASU 2016-08 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. The impact of ASU 2016-08 is currently being evaluated along with ASU 2014-09.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"), which amends guidance issued in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 718, Compensation   Stock Compensation. ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ), which provides guidance for accounting for leases. Under ASU 2016-02, the Company will be required to recognize the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by leased assets. ASU 2016-02 will take effect for public companies for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating its leases against the requirements of this pronouncement, with the primary effect of adopting the new standard being the requirement to record assets and obligations for operating leases with original terms greater than twelve months. 
  In November 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as a single non-current item on the balance sheet. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual reporting period. The Company plans to adopt ASU 2015-17 in the first quarter of 2017. This is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements other than reclassifying current deferred tax assets and liabilities to non-current on the balance sheet. 
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ), which addresses management s responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and for interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect to early adopt this guidance, and it believes the adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-09, which provides guidance for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets, and supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition,  and most industry-specific guidance. The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018. At that time, the Company may adopt the new standard under the full retrospective approach or the modified retrospective approach. The Company is currently evaluating its revenue streams against the requirements of this pronouncement.

NOTE 3  Net Income Per Share 
  Basic EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares (including participating securities) issued and outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares issued and outstanding plus equivalent shares, assuming the exercise of stock options. The dilutive effect of stock options is computed by application of the treasury-stock method. The following is a reconciliation between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding:   

NOTE 4  Business Combinations 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , Brown   Brown acquired the assets and assumed certain liabilities of   five   insurance intermediaries and all of the stock of   one   insurance intermediaries. Additionally, miscellaneous adjustments were recorded to the purchase price allocation of certain prior acquisitions completed within the last twelve months as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805     Business Combinations   ( ASC 805 ). Such adjustments are presented in the "Other" category within the following two tables. All of these businesses were acquired primarily to expand Brown   Brown s core business and to attract and hire high-quality individuals. The recorded purchase price for all acquisitions consummated after January 1, 2009 included an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. Subsequent changes in the fair value of earn-out obligations will be recorded in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income when incurred. 
  The fair value of earn-out obligations is based on the present value of the expected future payments to be made to the sellers of the acquired businesses in accordance with the provisions outlined in the respective purchase agreements. In determining fair value, the acquired business s future performance is estimated using financial projections developed by management for the acquired business and reflects market participant assumptions regarding revenue growth and/or profitability. The expected future payments are estimated on the basis of the earn-out formula and performance targets specified in each purchase agreement compared to the associated financial projections. These payments are then discounted to present value using a risk-adjusted rate that takes into consideration the likelihood that the forecasted earn-out payments will be made. 
  Based on the acquisition date and the complexity of the underlying valuation work, certain amounts included in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements may be provisional and thus subject to further adjustments within the permitted measurement period, as defined in ASC 805. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , several adjustments were made within the permitted measurement period that resulted in a decrease in the aggregate purchase price of the affected acquisitions of   $917,497   relating to the assumption of certain liabilities. These measurement period adjustments have been reflected as current period adjustments in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   in accordance with the guidance in ASU 2015-16 "Business Combinations".  The measurement period adjustments impacted goodwill, with no effect on earnings or cash in the current period.   
  Cash paid for acquisitions was $  115.3 million   and $  109.9 million   in the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. We completed   six   acquisitions (excluding book of business purchases) in the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016  . We completed   nine   acquisitions (excluding book of business purchases) in the   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2015  .

     Table of Contents  

The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation made as of the date of each acquisition for current year acquisitions and adjustments made during the measurement period for prior year acquisitions. The purchase price allocation for Social Security Advocates for the Disabled ("SSAD") and Morstan General Agency, Inc. ("Morstan") are provisional as they are based on initial valuations. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations for SSAD and Morstan that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assets and liabilities related to income taxes and residual goodwill. During the measurement periods, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of that date. With the Company's adoption of ASU No. 2015-16 in the first fiscal quarter of 2016, these adjustments will be made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date.  

The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the aggregate assets and liabilities acquired as of the date of each acquisition.     

The weighted average useful lives for the acquired amortizable intangible assets are as follows: purchased customer accounts,   15 years  ; and non-compete agreements,   5 years  . 
  Goodwill of   $85.7 million  , which is net of any opening balance sheet adjustments within the allowable measurement period, was allocated to the Retail, National Programs, Wholesale Brokerage and Service Segments in the amounts of   $11.9 million  ,   $(1.0) thousand  ,   $51.5 million   and   $22.4 million  , respectively. Of the total goodwill of   $85.7 million  ,   $60.5 million   is currently deductible for income tax purposes and   $21.4 million   is non-deductible. The remaining   $3.8 million   relates to the recorded earn-out payables and will not be deductible until it is earned and paid.

For the acquisitions completed during 2016, the results of operations since the acquisition dates have been combined with those of the Company. The total revenues from the acquisitions completed through   September 30, 2016  , included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were   $12.6 million   and   $21.5 million  , respectively. The income before income taxes, including the intercompany cost of capital charge, from the acquisitions completed through   September 30, 2016  , included in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were   $1.0 million   and   $2.4 million  . If the acquisitions had occurred as of the beginning of the respective periods, the Company s results of operations would be as shown in the following table. These unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of the actual results of operations that would have occurred had the acquisitions actually been made at the beginning of the respective periods. 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the fair values of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables were re-evaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3) as defined in ASC 820-  Fair Value Measurement  . The resulting additions, payments, and net changes, as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earn-out payables, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were as follows: 

Of the   $61.5   million estimated acquisition earn-out payables as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $23.0   million was recorded as accounts payable and   $38.5   million was recorded as other non-current liabilities. Included within the additions to estimated acquisition earn-out payables are any adjustments to opening balance sheet items within the allowable measurement period, which may therefore differ from previously reported amounts.

On December 22, 2006, the Company entered into a Master Shelf and Note Purchase Agreement (the  Master Agreement ) with a national insurance company (the  Purchaser ). The initial issuance of notes under the Master Agreement occurred on December 22, 2006, through the issuance of   $25.0 million   in Series C Senior Notes due December 22, 2016, with a fixed interest rate of   5.660%   per year. On February 1, 2008,   $25.0 million   in Series D Senior Notes due January 15, 2015, with a fixed interest rate of   5.370%   per year, were issued. On September 15, 2011, and pursuant to a Confirmation of Acceptance (the  Confirmation ), dated January 21, 2011, in connection with the Master Agreement,   $100.0 million   in Series E Senior Notes were issued and are due September 15, 2018, with a fixed interest rate of   4.500%   per year. The Series E Senior Notes were issued for the sole purpose of retiring existing senior notes. On January 15, 2015 the Series D Notes were redeemed at maturity using cash proceeds to pay off the principal of   $25.0 million   plus any remaining accrued interest. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was an outstanding debt balance issued under the provisions of the Master Agreement of   $125.0 million  . 
  On July 1, 2013, in conjunction with the acquisition of Beecher Carlson Holdings, Inc., the Company entered into a revolving loan agreement (the  Wells Fargo Agreement ) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. that provided for a   $50.0 million   revolving line of credit (the  Wells Fargo Revolver ). The maturity date for the Wells Fargo Revolver is   December 31, 2016  , at which time all outstanding principal and unpaid interest will be due. On April 16, 2014, in connection with the signing of the Credit Facility (as defined below) an amendment to the agreement was established to reduce the total revolving loan commitment from   $50.0 million   to   $25.0 million  . The Wells Fargo Revolver may be increased by up to   $50.0 million   (bringing the total amount available to   $75.0 million  ). The calculation of interest and fees for the Wells Fargo Agreement is generally based on the Company s funded debt-to-EBITDA ratio. Interest is charged at a rate equal to   1.000%   to   1.400%   above LIBOR or   1.000%   below the Base Rate, each as more fully described in the Wells Fargo Agreement. Fees include an up-front fee, an availability fee of   0.175%   to   0.250%  , and a letter of credit margin fee of   1.000%   to   1.400%  . The obligations under the Wells Fargo Revolver are unsecured and the Wells Fargo Agreement includes various covenants, limitations and events of default that are customary for similar facilities for similar borrowers. On March 14, 2016, the Wells Fargo Revolver was terminated before its maturity date as mentioned above with no fees incurred.  There were   no   borrowings against the Wells Fargo Revolver as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.  
  On April 17, 2014, the Company entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent and certain other banks as co-syndication agents and co-documentation agents (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement in the amount of   $1,350.0 million   provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Credit Facility ) in the initial amount of   $800.0 million   and unsecured term loans in the initial amount of   $550.0 million  , either or both of which may, subject to lenders  discretion, potentially be increased by up to   $500.0 million  . The Credit Facility was funded on May 20, 2014 in conjunction with the closing of the Wright acquisition, with the   $550.0 million   term loan being funded as well as a drawdown of   $375.0 million   on the revolving loan facility. Use of these proceeds was to retire existing term loan debt and to facilitate the closing of the Wright acquisition as well as other acquisitions. The Credit Facility terminates on May 20, 2019, but either or both of the revolving Credit Facility and the term loans may be extended for   two   additional   one  -year periods at the Company s request and at the discretion of the respective lenders. Interest and facility fees in respect to the Credit Facility are based on the better of the Company s net debt leverage ratio or a non-credit enhanced senior unsecured long-term debt rating. Based on the Company s net debt leverage ratio, the rates of interest charged on the term loan are   1.000%   to   1.750%  , and the revolving loan is   0.850%   to   1.500%   above the adjusted LIBOR rate for outstanding amounts drawn. There are fees included in the facility which include a facility fee based on the revolving credit commitments of the lenders (whether used or unused) at a rate of   0.150%   to   0.250%   and letter of credit fees based on the amounts of outstanding secured or unsecured letters of credit. The Credit Facility includes various covenants, limitations and events of default customary for similar facilities for similarly rated borrowers. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, there was an outstanding debt balance issued under the provisions of the Credit Facility in total of   $495.0 million   and   $529.4 million   respectively, with   no   borrowings outstanding relative to the revolving loan. Per the terms of the agreement, a scheduled principal payment of   $13.8 million   is due on December 31, 2016. 
          On September 18, 2014, the Company issued   $500.0 million   of   4.200%   unsecured senior notes due in   2024  . The senior notes were given investment grade ratings of BBB-/Baa3 with a stable outlook. The notes are subject to certain covenant restrictions and regulations which are customary for credit rated obligations. At the time of funding, the proceeds were offered at a discount of the original note amount which also excluded an underwriting fee discount. The net proceeds received from the issuance were used to repay the outstanding balance of   $475.0 million   on the revolving Credit Facility and for other general corporate purposes. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, there was an outstanding debt balance of   $500.0 million   exclusive of the associated discount balance. 
  The Master Agreement and the Credit Agreement all require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios and comply with certain other covenants. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
  The 30-day Adjusted LIBOR Rate as of   September 30, 2016   was   0.563%  .

NOTE 8  Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information and Non-Cash Financing and Investing Activities 
  Our Restricted Cash balance is composed of funds held in separate premium trust accounts as required by state law or, in some cases, pursuant to agreements with our carrier partners. In the second quarter of 2015, certain balances that had previously been reported as held in restricted premium trust accounts were reclassified as non-restricted as they were not restricted by state law or by contractual agreement with a carrier. The resulting impact of this change is a reduction during the second quarter of 2015 of approximately $41.0 million in the balance reported on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as Restricted Cash and Investments and a corresponding increase in the balance reported as Cash and Cash Equivalents. While these balances are not restricted, they do represent premium payments from customers to be paid to insurance carriers and this change should not be viewed as a source of operating cash. 

Brown   Brown s significant non-cash investing and financing activities are summarized as follows: 

NOTE 9  Legal and Regulatory Proceedings 
  The Company is involved in numerous pending or threatened proceedings by or against Brown   Brown, Inc. or one or more of its subsidiaries that arise in the ordinary course of business. The damages that may be claimed against the Company in these various proceedings are in some cases substantial, including in certain instances claims for punitive or extraordinary damages. Some of these claims and lawsuits have been resolved, others are in the process of being resolved and others are still in the investigation or discovery phase. The Company will continue to respond appropriately to these claims and lawsuits and to vigorously protect its interests. 
  We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could adversely impact the Company s operating results, cash flows and overall liquidity. The Company maintains third-party insurance policies to provide coverage for certain legal claims, in an effort to mitigate its overall exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. However, as (i) one or more of the Company s insurance carriers could take the position that portions of these claims are not covered by the Company s insurance, (ii) to the extent that payments are made to resolve claims and lawsuits, applicable insurance policy limits are eroded and (iii) the claims and lawsuits relating to these matters are continuing to develop, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by unfavorable resolutions of these matters. Based on the AM Best Company ratings of these third-party insurers, management does not believe there is a substantial risk of an insurer s material non-performance related to any current insured claims. 
  On the basis of current information, the availability of insurance and legal advice, in management s opinion, the Company is not currently involved in any legal proceedings which, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, operations and/or cash flows. 
   
  NOTE 10  Segment Information 
  Brown   Brown s business is divided into   four   reportable segments: (1) the Retail Segment, which provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public and quasi-public entities, and to professional and individual customers; (2) the National Programs Segment, which acts as a MGA, provides professional liability and related package products for certain professionals, a range of insurance products for individuals, flood coverage, and targeted products and services designated for specific industries, trade groups, governmental entities and market niches, all of which are delivered through nationwide networks of independent agents, and Brown   Brown retail agents; (3) the Wholesale Brokerage Segment, which markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers, as well as Brown   Brown retail agents; and (4) the Services Segment, which provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers

  Brown   Brown conducts all of its operations within the United States of America, except for a wholesale brokerage operation based in London, England, and retail operations in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. These operations earned   $3.8 million   and   $3.2 million   of total revenues for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These operations earned   $10.3 million   and   $9.3 million   of total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Long-lived assets held outside of the United States as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were not material. 
  The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1 of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The Company evaluates the performance of its segments based upon revenues and income before income taxes. Inter-segment revenues are eliminated. 
  Summarized financial information concerning the Company s reportable segments is shown in the following table. The  Other  column includes any income and expenses not allocated to reportable segments, corporate-related items, including the inter-company interest expense charge to the reporting segment, and the elimination of inter-segment activities.

NOTE 11  Investments 
   At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s amortized cost and fair values of fixed maturity securities are summarized as follows:      

  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   $26.9 million   in fixed income securities composed of U.S. Treasury securities, securities issued by U.S. Government agencies and Municipalities, and   $3.2 million   issued by corporations with investment grade ratings. Of that total,   $3.8 million   is classified as short-term investments on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as maturities are less than one-year. Additionally, the Company holds   $9.5 million   in short-term investments which are related to time deposits held with various financial institutions. 
  For securities in a loss position, the following table shows the investments  gross unrealized loss and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The unrealized losses were caused by interest rate increases. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   10   securities in an unrealized loss position. The corporate securities are highly rated securities with no indicators of potential impairment. Based on the ability and intent of the Company to hold these investments until recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the bonds were not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
  At   December 31, 2015  , the Company s amortized cost and fair values of fixed maturity securities are summarized as follows:

The following table shows the investments  gross unrealized loss and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of   December 31, 2015  : 

The unrealized losses in the Company's investments in U.S. Treasury Securities and obligations of U.S. Government agencies and bonds from corporate issuers were caused by interest rate increases. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   35   securities in an unrealized loss position. The contractual cash flows of the U.S. Treasury Securities and obligations of the U.S. Government agencies investments are either guaranteed by the U.S. Government or an agency of the U.S. Government. Accordingly, it is expected that the securities would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the Company s investment. The corporate securities are highly rated securities with no indicators of potential impairment. Based on the ability and intent of the Company to hold these investments until recovery of fair value, which may be maturity, the bonds were not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   December 31, 2015  . 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the fixed maturity securities at   September 30, 2016   by contractual maturity are set forth below: 

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of the fixed maturity securities at   December 31, 2015   by contractual maturity are set forth below: 

The expected maturities in the foregoing table may differ from the contractual maturities because certain borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without penalty. 
  Proceeds from the sales and maturity of the Company s investment in fixed maturity securities were   $4.7 million  . This along with maturing time deposits and the utilization of funds from a money-market investment account of $8.2 million yielded total cash proceeds from the sale of investments of $16.7 million in the period of   January 1, 2016   to   September 30, 2016  . These proceeds were used to purchase additional fixed maturity securities. The gains and losses realized on those sales for the period from January 1, 2016 to   September 30, 2016   were   insignificant  . Additionally, there was a sale of the short-duration fixed income fund which resulted in cash proceeds of $1.7 million, as the fund was liquidated in the third quarter of 2016. Gains on this sale were also insignificant. 
  Realized gains and losses are reported on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income, with the cost of securities sold determined on a specific identification basis. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , investments with a fair value of approximately   $4.0 million   were on deposit with state insurance departments to satisfy regulatory requirements.

The effects of reinsurance on premiums written and earned are as follows: 

All premiums written by Wright Flood under the National Flood Insurance Program are   100%   ceded to FEMA, for which Wright Flood received a   30.9%   expense allowance from January 1, 2016 through   September 30, 2016  .

  As of   September 30, 2016   the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet contained reinsurance recoverable of   $332.0 million   and prepaid reinsurance premiums of   $334.0 million  . There was   no   net activity in the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense during the period January 1, 2016 through   September 30, 2016  , as Wright Flood's direct premiums written were   100%   ceded to   two   reinsurers. The balance of the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expense, excluding related reinsurance recoverable, as of   September 30, 2016   was   $332.0 million  .  
   
  NOTE 13  Statutory Financial Data

  ITEM 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
  The following discussion updates the MD A contained in the Company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and the two discussions should be read together. 
   
  GENERAL 
  Company Overview     Third Quarter   of   2016    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes to those Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, please see  Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures  below, regarding important information on non-GAAP financial measures contained in our discussion and analysis. 
  We are a diversified insurance agency, wholesale brokerage, insurance programs and services organization headquartered in Daytona Beach, Florida. As an insurance intermediary, our principal sources of revenue are commissions paid by insurance companies and, to a lesser extent, fees paid directly by customers. Commission revenues generally represent a percentage of the premium paid by an insured and are affected by fluctuations in both premium rate levels charged by insurance companies and the insureds  underlying  insurable exposure units,  which are units that insurance companies use to measure or express insurance exposed to risk (such as property values, or sales and payroll levels) to determine what premium to charge the insured. Insurance companies establish these premium rates based upon many factors, including loss experience, risk profile, and reinsurance rates paid by such insurance companies, none of which we control.  
  The volume of business from new and existing customers, fluctuations in insurable exposure units, changes in premium rate levels, and changes in general economic and competitive conditions all affect our revenues. For example, level rates of inflation or a general decline in economic activity could limit increases in the values of insurable exposure units. Conversely, the increasing costs of litigation settlements and awards have caused some customers to seek higher levels of insurance coverage. Historically, our revenues have typically grown as a result of our focus on net new business growth and acquisitions. We foster a strong, decentralized sales and service culture with the goal of consistent, sustained growth over the long-term.   
   The term  core commissions and fees  excludes profit-sharing contingent commissions and guaranteed supplemental commissions, and therefore represents the revenues earned directly from specific insurance policies sold, and specific fee-based services rendered. The term  core organic commissions and fees  is our core commissions and fees less (i) the core commissions and fees earned for the first twelve months by newly-acquired operations and (ii) divested business (core commissions and fees generated from offices, books of business or niches sold or terminated during the comparable period).  Core organic commissions and fees , a non-GAAP measure, are reported in this manner in order to express the current year s core commissions and fees on a comparable basis with the prior year s core commissions and fees. The resulting net change reflects the aggregate changes attributable to (i) net new and lost accounts, (ii) net changes in our clients  exposure units, and (iii) net changes in insurance premium rates or the commission rate paid to us by our carrier partners.  
  We also earn  profit-sharing contingent commissions,  which are profit-sharing commissions based primarily on underwriting results, but which may also reflect considerations for volume, growth and/or retention. These commissions are primarily received in the first and second quarters of each year, based on the aforementioned considerations for the prior year(s). Over the last three years, profit-sharing contingent commissions have averaged approximately 4.0% of the previous year s total commissions and fees revenue. Profit-sharing contingent commissions are included in our total commissions and fees in the Consolidated Statement of Income in the year received. For the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , profit-sharing contingent commissions were down $3.8 million as compared to the same period of the prior year. 
  Certain insurance companies offer guaranteed fixed-base agreements, referred to as  Guaranteed Supplemental Commissions  ( GSCs ) in lieu of profit-sharing contingent commissions. Since GSCs are not subject to the uncertainty of loss ratios, they are accrued throughout the year based on actual premiums written. For the twelve-month period ending   December 31, 2015  , we had earned $10.0 million of GSCs, of which $7.6 million remained accrued at December 31, 2015, the balance of which is typically collected over the first and second quarter. For the three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we earned and accrued $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively, and for the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we earned and accrued $8.9 million and $8.1 million, respectively, from GSCs.

     Table of Contents  

Combined, our profit-sharing contingent commissions and GSCs for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $3.4 million   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily in our Wholesale Brokerage Segment. 
  Fee revenues relate to fees negotiated in lieu of commissions, which are recognized as services are rendered. Fee revenues have historically been generated primarily by: (1) our Services Segment, which provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers  compensation and all-lines liability arenas, as well as Medicare Set-aside services, Social Security disability and Medicare benefits advocacy services, and claims adjusting services, and (2) our National Programs and Wholesale Brokerage Segments, which earn fees primarily for the issuance of insurance policies on behalf of insurance companies, and to a lesser extent (3) our Retail Segment in our large-account customer base. These services are provided over a period of time, typically one year. Fee revenues, on a consolidated basis, as a percentage of our total commissions and fees, represented 30.6% in   2015  , 30.6% in   2014   and 26.6% in   2013  . 
  For the   three and nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated internal revenue growth rate was   4.3%   and   2.8%  , respectively. Additionally, each of our four segments recorded positive internal revenue growth for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . In the event that the gradual increases in insurable exposure units that occurred in the past few years continues through 2016 and premium rate changes are similar with 2015, we believe we will continue to see positive quarterly internal revenue growth rates in 2016. 
  Historically, investment income has consisted primarily of interest earnings on operating cash as well as on premiums and advance premiums collected and held in a fiduciary capacity before being remitted to insurance companies. Our policy is to invest available funds in high-quality, short-term fixed income investment securities. Investment income also includes gains and losses realized from the sale of investments. Other income primarily reflects legal settlements and other miscellaneous income and for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $0.3 million   as compared to the same period of the prior year, primarily reflecting that prior to 2016 we reported gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets as Other income. 
  Income before income taxes for the three-month period ended   September 30, 2016     increased   from the   third   quarter of   2015   by   $4.1 million  , primarily as a result of acquisitions completed in the past twelve months and profits from net new business partially offset by the change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
  Information Regarding Non-GAAP Measures 
  In the discussion and analysis of our results of operations, in addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we provide information regarding core commissions and fees, core organic commissions and fees, and our internal growth rate, which is the growth rate of our core organic commissions and fees. These measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to the GAAP information provided in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Tabular reconciliations of this supplemental non-GAAP financial information to our most comparable GAAP information are contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. We present such non-GAAP supplemental financial information, as we believe such information provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of our operating performance from period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis. This supplemental financial information should be considered in addition to, not in lieu of, our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Acquisitions 
  Part of our continuing business strategy is to attract high-quality insurance intermediaries to join our operations. From 1993 through the   third   quarter of   2016  , we acquired   478   insurance intermediary operations, excluding acquired books of business (customer accounts). 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  We have had no changes to our Critical Accounting Policies. We believe that of our significant accounting and reporting policies, the more critical policies include our accounting for revenue recognition, business combinations and purchase price allocations, intangible asset impairments and reserves for litigation. In particular, the accounting for these areas requires significant use of judgment by management. Different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. Refer to Note 1 in the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission for details regarding our critical and significant accounting policies.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE   THREE AND NINE   MONTHS ENDED   SEPTEMBER 30,     2016   AND   2015    
  The following discussion and analysis regarding results of operations and liquidity and capital resources should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. 
  Financial information relating to our Condensed Consolidated Financial results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows:

  Commissions and Fees 
  Commissions and fees, including profit-sharing contingent commissions and GSCs, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $29.8 million   to   $461.7 million  , or   6.9%   over the same period in   2015  . Core commissions and fees revenue for the   third   quarter of   2016     increased     $33.2 million  , of which approximately   $17.3 million   represented core commissions and fees from agencies acquired since   2015   that had no comparable revenues in the same period of   2015  . After accounting for divested business of   $2.0 million  , the remaining net increase of   $17.9 million   represented net new business, which reflects a growth rate of   4.3%   for core organic commissions and fees. Profit-sharing contingent commissions and GSCs for the   third   quarter of   2016     decreased   by   $3.4 million  , or   23.3%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The net   decrease   of   $3.4 million   in the   third   quarter was mainly driven by a decrease in profit-sharing contingent commissions in the Wholesale Brokerage Segment as a result of carrier experience. 
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   commissions and fees, including profit-sharing contingent commissions and GSCs,   increased     $76.8 million   to   $1,329.6 million  , or   6.1%   over the same period in   2015  . Core commissions and fees revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $75.0 million  , of which approximately   $47.5 million   represented core commissions and fees from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of   2015  . After accounting for divested business of   $5.9 million  , the remaining

     Table of Contents  

net increase of   $33.4 million   represented net new business, which reflects an internal growth rate of   2.8%   for core organic commissions and fees. Profit-sharing contingent commissions and GSCs for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $1.8 million  , or   3.3%  , compared to the same period in   2015  . The net   increase   of   $1.8 million   in the first   nine months   of   2016   was mainly driven by an increase in profit-sharing contingent commissions in the National Programs and Retail Segments, which was partially offset by a decrease in the Wholesale Brokerage Segment. 
  Investment Income 
  Investment income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     remained flat   over the same period in   2015  .  Investment income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.4 million  , or   62.4%  , over the same period in   2015  . This increase was related to higher average invested cash balances and additional interest income driven by cash management activities to earn a higher yield.  
  Other Income, net 
  Other income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $0.4 million  , compared with   $0.1 million   in the same period in   2015  . Other income consists primarily of legal settlements and other miscellaneous income. The   $0.3 million   increase for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   from the comparable period in   2015   was primarily a result of a change in accounting treatment for the loss on fixed asset sales.  
  Other income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $2.2 million  , compared with   $2.3 million   in the same period in   2015  . The   $0.1 million     decrease   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from the comparable period in   2015   was primarily due to a $1.0 million benefit received from Company-owned life insurance, offset by a legal settlement realized in the prior year. 
  Employee Compensation and Benefits 
  Employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to   51.4%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , from   50.0%   for the   three months ended September 30,     2015  . Employee compensation and benefits for the   third   quarter of   2016     increased  , approximately   9.9%  , or   $21.5 million  , over the same period in   2015  . This net increase included   $2.7 million   of compensation costs related to stand-alone acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of   2015  . Therefore, employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same three-month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   increased by   $18.8 million   or 8.7%. The employee compensation and benefits expense net increases for these offices were primarily related to (i) an increase in staff salaries attributable to salary inflation and higher volumes in portions of our business; (ii) increased producer commissions due to increased revenue; and (iii) cost associated with our deferred compensation plan which are largely offset by unrealized gains reported in other operating expenses. 
  Employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total revenues increased to   52.0%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   51.4%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Employee compensation and benefits for the first nine months of   2016     increased  , by approximately   7.3%  , or   $47.4 million  , over the same period in   2015  . This increase included   $17.3 million   of compensation costs related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of   2015  . Therefore, employee compensation and benefits expense attributable to those offices that existed in the same   nine  -month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   increased by   $30.1 million   or 4.7%. The employee compensation and benefits expense increases for these offices were primarily related to (i) an increase in staff salaries attributable to salary inflation and higher volumes in portions of our business; (ii) increased producer commissions due to increased revenue; and (iii) a decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation which partially offset the overall increase. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
  As a percentage of total revenues, other operating expenses represented   14.6%   in the   third   quarter of   2016  , versus   15.3%   reported in the   third   quarter of   2015  . Other operating expenses for the   third   quarter of   2016     increased     $1.3 million  , or   2.0%  , over the same period of   2015  , of which   $0.6 million   was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of   2015  . The other operating expenses for those offices that existed in both three-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively,   increased   by   $0.7 million  , which was primarily attributable to (i) increased expenses associated with information technology services and consulting; (ii) a decrease in life insurance expense related to the deferred compensation plan; and (iii) partially offset by the benefits from our strategic purchasing program. 
  Other operating expenses represented   14.8%   of total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , versus   15.3%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Other operating expenses for the first nine months of   2016     increased     $5.7 million  , or   3.0%  , over the same period of   2015  , of which   $6.1 million   was related to acquisitions that had no comparable costs in the same period of   2015  . The other operating expenses for those offices that existed in both of the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively,   decreased   by   $0.4 million  , which was primarily attributable to information technology services, consulting expenses and office rent offset by a decrease in life insurance expense related to the deferred compensation plan and benefits from our strategic purchasing program and premium tax refunds received in National Programs.

Gain on Disposal 
  Gain on disposal for the   third   quarter of   2016     decreased     $0.4 million   from the   third   quarter of   2015  . Gain on disposal for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.9 million   over the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The change in the gain on disposal for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was due to activity associated with book of business sales. Although we are not in the business of selling customer accounts, we periodically sell an office or a book of business (one or more customer accounts) because we believe doing so is in the Company s best interest.  
  Amortization 
  Amortization expense for the   third   quarter of   2016     decreased     $0.4 million  , or   1.6%  , over the   third   quarter of   2015  . Amortization expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $0.4 million  , or   0.6%  , over the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . These decreases reflect certain intangibles becoming fully amortized, partially offset with amortization of new intangibles from recently acquired businesses. 
  Depreciation 
  Depreciation expense for the   third   quarter of   2016     remained flat   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . Depreciation expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.2 million  , or   1.5%  , over the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . These changes were due primarily to the addition of fixed assets resulting from acquisitions completed since the first three quarters of 2015, net of assets which became fully depreciated. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense for the   third   quarter of   2016     remained flat   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . Interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.2 million  , or   0.7%  , over the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase was due to a rise in the floating interest rate of our Credit Facility term loan, partially offset by the scheduled amortized principal payments on the Credit Facility term loan which has reduced the Company's average debt balance.  
  Change in Estimated Acquisition Earn-Out Payables 
  Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 805-  Business Combinations   is the authoritative guidance requiring an acquiring entity to recognize 100% of the fair value of acquired assets, including goodwill, and assumed liabilities (with only limited exceptions) upon initially obtaining control of an acquired entity. Additionally, the fair value of contingent consideration arrangements (such as earn-out purchase price arrangements) at the acquisition date must be included in the purchase price consideration. As a result, the recorded purchase prices for all acquisitions consummated after January 1, 2009 include an estimation of the fair value of liabilities associated with any potential earn-out provisions. Subsequent changes in these earn-out obligations are required to be recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Income when incurred or reasonably estimated. Estimations of potential earn-out obligations are typically based upon future earnings of the acquired operations or entities, usually for periods ranging from one to three years. 
  The net charge or credit to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income for the period is the combination of the net change in the estimated acquisition earn-out payables balance, and the interest expense imputed on the outstanding balance of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the fair values of the estimated acquisition earn-out payables were re-evaluated and measured at fair value on a recurring basis using unobservable inputs (Level 3) as defined in ASC 820-  Fair Value Measurement  . The resulting net changes, as well as the interest expense accretion on the estimated acquisition earn-out payables, for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows:

     Table of Contents  

For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the fair value of estimated earn-out payables was re-evaluated and increased by   $2.9 million   and decreased by   $0.4 million  , respectively, which resulted in charges and credits to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the fair value of estimated earn-out payables was re-evaluated and increased by   $4.7 million   and decreased by   $0.03 million  , respectively, which resulted in charges and credits to the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Income. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the estimated acquisition earn-out payables equaled   $61.5 million  , of which   $23.0 million   was recorded as accounts payable and   $38.5 million   was recorded as other non-current liability. 
  Income Taxes 
  The effective tax rate on income from operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   38.8%   and   40.2%  , respectively. The effective tax rate on income from operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   39.2%   and   39.7%   respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate is driven by several permanent tax differences along with the apportionment of taxable income in the states where we operate. 
   
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  As discussed in Note 10 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, we operate four reportable segments: Retail, National Programs, Wholesale Brokerage, and Services. On a segmented basis, increases in amortization, depreciation and interest expenses generally result from completed acquisitions within a given segment in a particular year. Likewise, other income in each segment reflects net gains primarily from legal settlements and miscellaneous income. As such, in evaluating the operational efficiency of a segment, management emphasizes the net internal growth rate of core commissions and fees revenue, the ratio of total employee compensation and benefits to total revenues, and the ratio of other operating expenses to total revenues. 
  The internal growth rates for our core organic commissions and fees for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , by segment, are as follows: 

The reconciliation of the above internal growth schedule to the total commissions and fees included in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , and   2015  , is as follows:

Retail Segment 
  The Retail Segment provides a broad range of insurance products and services to commercial, public and quasi-public, professional and individual insured customers. Approximately   88%   of the Retail Segment s commissions and fees revenue is commission-based. Because most of our other operating expenses are not correlated to changes in commissions on insurance premiums, a significant portion of any fluctuation in the commissions we receive, net of related producer compensation, will result in a similar fluctuation in our income before income taxes, unless we make incremental investments or modifications to the costs in the organization. 
  Financial information relating to our Retail Segment for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

NMF = Not a meaningful figure 
     The Retail Segment s total revenue during the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     5.7%  , or   $12.4 million  , over the same period in   2015  , to   $228.6 million  . The   $11.5 million     increase   in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following: (i) approximately   $6.2 million   related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2015; (ii)   $5.9 million   related to net new business; and (iii) an offsetting decrease of $0.6 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in   2015   and   2016  . Profit-sharing contingent commissions and GSCs for the   third   quarter of   2016     increased     22.6%  , or   $0.9 million  , from the same period in   2015  , to   $4.7 million   due to better performance realized by our insurance carrier partners. The Retail Segment s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was   2.8%   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and was driven by revenue from net new business written during the preceding twelve months, which was impacted by some exposure unit growth and modest increases in commercial auto rates, and was partially offset by continued reductions in property insurance premium rates, particularly in catastrophe prone areas. The internal growth rate was also partially driven by timing items related to revenue that was not recognized in previous quarters.

Income before income taxes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     7.4%  , or   $3.1 million  , over the same period in   2015  , to   $44.9 million  . The primary factors affecting this increase were: (i) the net increase in revenue as described above, in addition to increased retail margins in contingents and GSCs, offset by, (ii) total compensation which   increased   by   $6.3 million   or   5.4%  , due primarily to new teammates related to acquisitions completed over the past twelve months, salary inflation, and additional teammates to support revenue growth; (iii) operating expenses which   increased   by   $1.4 million   or   4.0%  , due primarily to information technology services fees, professional fees relating to value added services in support of revenue generation, and rent expense partially offset by the benefits of our strategic purchasing program; (iv) a change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables that increased by $3.2 million to $3.5 million; and (v) a $0.4 million change  in the benefit of gains on disposals to $0.3 million associated with book sales within certain profit centers. 
  The Retail Segment s total revenue during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     5.8%  , or   $38.1 million  , over the same period in   2015  , to   $695.4 million  . The   $36.4 million     increase   in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following: (i) approximately   $27.1 million   related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2015; (ii)   $11.1 million   related to net new business; and (iii) an offsetting decrease of $1.8 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in   2015   and   2016  . Profit-sharing contingent commissions and GSCs for the first nine months of   2016     increased     12.3%  , or   $3.5 million  , from the same period in   2015  , to   $31.9 million  . The Retail Segment s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was   1.8%   for the first nine months of   2016   and was driven by revenue from net new business written during the preceding twelve months, some exposure unit growth, and modest increases in commercial auto rates, which was partially offset by continued reductions in property insurance premium rates, particularly in catastrophe prone areas. 
  Income before income taxes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     5.3%  , or   $7.2 million  , over the same period in   2015  , to   $144.5 million  . The primary factors affecting this increase were: (i) the net increase in revenue as described above; (ii) total compensation   increased   by   $23.7 million   or   6.9%  , due primarily to new teammates related to acquisitions completed over the past twelve months, salary inflation, and additional teammates to support revenue growth; (iii) operating expenses which   increased   by   $6.1 million   or   5.8%  , due primarily to information technology services fees, professional fees relating to value added services in support of revenue generation, and rent expense partially offset by the benefits or our strategic purchasing program; (iv) a change in estimated acquisition earn-out payables that increased $5.3 million to $6.6 million; partially offset by (v) a $1.8 million change in the benefit of gains on disposals to $3.1 million associated with book sales within certain profit centers.

National Programs Segment 
  The National Programs Segment manages over 50 programs supported by approximately 40 well-capitalized carrier partners. In most cases, the insurance carriers that support the programs have delegated underwriting and, in many instances, claims-handling authority to our programs operations. These programs are generally distributed through a nationwide network of independent agents and Brown   Brown retail agents, and offer targeted products and services designed for specific industries, trade groups, professions, public entities and market niches. The National Programs Segment operations can be grouped into five broad categories: Professional Programs, Arrowhead Insurance Programs, Commercial Programs, Public Entity-Related Programs and the National Flood Program. The National Programs Segment s revenue is primarily commission-based. 
  Financial information relating to our National Programs Segment for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

NMF = Not a meaningful figure 
  The National Program Segment's revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     5.7%  , or   $6.7 million  , from the same period in   2015  , to   $123.6 million  . The   $7.3 million   net   increase   in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by: (i)   $7.9 million   related to net new business and (ii) a decrease of $0.6 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in the   third   quarter of 2015 from businesses since divested. Profit-sharing contingent commissions and GSCs were   $2.5 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , which was   a decrease   of   $0.7 million   from the   third   quarter of   2015  , primarily related to one of our coastal property programs shifting premium to other carriers within the program to better manage market conditions. 
  The National Programs Segment s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was   7.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . This internal growth rate was mainly due to increased flood claims revenues and revenues from our lender placed coverage program. Growth in this segment was partially offset by certain programs that have been affected by lower premium rates, primarily in our coastal property programs.

Income before income taxes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     27.8%  , or   $7.0 million  , from the same period in   2015  , to   $32.3 million  . The increase was driven by the net revenue growth noted above, and continued expense management initiatives as we grow and scale our programs along with a $2.6 million decrease in the intercompany interest expense charge for acquisitions.  We charge our segments an intercompany interest charge associated with the cost of capital for each business they acquire.  This intercompany interest charge is reduced each year according to a fixed amortization schedule. 
  National Programs revenue for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     4.4%  , or   $13.9 million  , from the same period in   2015  , to   $333.5 million  . The   $12.1 million     increase   in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by: (i)   $11.6 million   related to net new business, (ii) approximately   $1.7 million   related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2015, and (iii) a decrease of $1.2 million related to commissions and fees revenue from business divested in   2015   and   2016  . Profit-sharing contingent commissions and GSCs were   $12.2 million   for the first nine months of   2016  , which was   an increase   of   $1.4 million   from the same period in   2015  . 
  The National Programs Segment s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was   3.8%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . This internal growth rate was mainly due to increased flood claims revenues and revenues from our lender placed coverage program. Growth in this segment was partially offset by certain programs that have been affected by lower premium rates, primarily in our costal property programs.   
  Income before income taxes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     40.8%  , or   $19.8 million  , from the same period in   2015  , to   68.4 million  . The increase was driven by the net revenue growth noted above, expense management initiatives as we grow and scale our programs, $5.8 million in credits related to premium taxes along with a $7.4 million decrease in the intercompany interest expense charge for acquisitions.  We charge our segments an intercompany interest charge associated with the cost of capital for each business they acquire.  This intercompany interest charge is reduced each year according to a fixed amortization schedule.

Wholesale Brokerage Segment 
  The Wholesale Brokerage Segment markets and sells excess and surplus commercial and personal lines insurance, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Like the Retail and National Programs Segments, the Wholesale Brokerage Segment s revenues are primarily commission-based. 
  Financial information relating to our Wholesale Brokerage Segment for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

NMF = Not a meaningful figure 
  The Wholesale Brokerage Segment s total revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     14.4%  , or   $8.8 million  , from the same period in   2015  , to   $70.2 million  . The   $12.4 million   net   increase   in core commissions and fees revenue was driven primarily by the following: (i)   $8.8 million   related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2015; and (ii)   $3.6 million   related to net new business. Contingent commissions and GSCs for the   third   quarter of   2016     decreased     $3.6 million   compared to the   third   quarter of 2015, to   $3.9 million  . This decrease in contingents was driven by an increase in loss ratios with certain carriers. The Wholesale Brokerage Segment s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was   6.7%   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , and was driven by net new business and modest increases in exposure units, partially offset by contraction in insurance premium rates for catastrophe prone properties. 
  Income before income taxes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     6.3%  , or   $1.4 million  , over the same period in   2015  , to   $20.9 million  , primarily due to the following: (i) the net increase in revenue as described above, offset by; (ii) an increase in employee compensation and benefits of $6.8  million, of which $4.7 million was related to acquisitions that had no comparable compensation and benefits in the same period of 2015, with the remainder related to additional teammates to support increased transaction volumes; (iii) a decrease in profit from lower contingent commissions and GSCs; (iv) a $1.7 million increase in operating expenses, of which $1.5 million was related to acquisitions that had no comparable expenses in the same period of 2015 and (v) higher intercompany interest charge related to acquisitions completed in the previous year.

The   $19.5 million   net   increase   in core commissions and fees revenue was driven primarily by the following: (i)   $7.4 million   related to net new business; and (ii)   $12.1 million   related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2015. Contingent commissions and GSCs for the first nine months of   2016     decreased     $3.2 million   compared to the same period of 2015, to   $11.5 million  . This decrease in contingents was driven by an increase in loss ratios with certain carriers. The Wholesale Brokerage Segment s internal growth rate for core organic commissions and fees revenue was   4.8%   for the first nine months of   2016  , and was driven by net new business and modest increases in exposure units, partially offset by significant contraction in insurance premium rates for catastrophe prone properties.

Services Segment 
  The Services Segment provides insurance-related services, including third-party claims administration and comprehensive medical utilization management services in both the workers  compensation and all-lines liability arenas. The Services Segment also provides Medicare Set-aside account services, Social Security disability and Medicare benefits advocacy services, and claims adjusting services. 
  Unlike the other segments, nearly all of the Services Segment s revenue is generated from fees, which are not significantly affected by fluctuations in general insurance premiums. 
  Financial information relating to our Services Segment for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

NMF = Not a meaningful figure 
  The Services Segment s total revenues for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased     4.2%  , or   $1.6 million  , over the same period in   2015  , to   $39.6 million  . The   $1.5 million     increase   in core commissions and fees revenue was driven primarily by the following: (i)   $2.3 million   related to the core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2015; and (ii)   $0.6 million   related to net new business; (iii) partially offset by a decrease of $1.4 million related to commissions and fees revenue recorded in the   third   quarter of 2015 from businesses since divested. The Services Segment s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was   1.6%   for the   third   quarter of   2016  . This growth was driven primarily by an increase in weather-related claims. 
  Income before income taxes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     0.8%  , or   $0.1 million  , over the same period in   2015  , to   $6.0 million   due to a combination of internal revenue growth as noted above offset by higher variable costs for certain of our businesses. 
  The Services Segment s total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     6.1%  , or   $6.8 million  , over the same period in   2015  , to   $117.9 million  . The   $6.6 million     increase   in core commissions and fees revenue was driven by the following: (i) approximately   $6.6 million   related to core commissions and fees revenue from acquisitions that had no comparable revenues in the same period of 2015; (ii)   $3.3 million   related to net new business; and (iii) that was partially offset by a decrease of $3.3 million related to commissions and

fees revenue from business divested in   2015   and   2016  . The Services Segment s internal growth rate for core commissions and fees revenue was   3.1%   for the first nine months of   2016  . This growth was driven primarily by an increase in weather related claims, our Social Security Advocacy businesses and partially offset by some decline in our Medicare Set-aside businesses as there were lower referrals. 
  Income before income taxes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     11.6%  , or   $1.9 million  , over the same period in   2015  , to   $17.9 million   due to a combination of internal revenue growth noted above and the continued efficient operating of our businesses.

  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  The Company strives to maintain a conservative balance sheet with regard to debt and liquidity. Our capital requirements to operate as an insurance intermediary are low and we have been able to grow and invest in our business principally through cash that has been generated from operations. We have the ability to access the use of our revolving Credit Facility, which provides up to $800.0 million in available cash, and we believe that we have access to additional funds, if needed, through the capital markets to obtain further debt financing under the current market conditions. The Company believes that its existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investment portfolio and funds generated from operations, together with the funds available under the Credit Facility, will be sufficient to satisfy our normal liquidity needs, including principal payments on our long-term debt, for at least the next twelve months. 
  Contractual Cash Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our contractual cash obligations were as follows: 

(1) 
    Includes the current portion of other long-term liabilities. 
              (2) 
    Includes $61.5 million of current and non-current estimated earn-out payables. 
     Debt 
  Total debt at   September 30, 2016   was $1,112.2 million, which was a decrease of $32.5 million compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease includes the repayment of $34.3 million in principal, net of the amortization of discounted debt related to our 4.200% Notes due 2024 and debt issuance cost amortization of $1.2 million plus the addition of $0.5 million in a short-term note payable related to the recent acquisition of Social Security Advocates for the Disabled, LLC.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company satisfied the fifth installment of scheduled quarterly principal payments on the Credit Facility term loan. The Company has satisfied $55.0 million in total principal payments through September 30, 2016 since the inception of the note. Scheduled quarterly principal payments are expected to be made until maturity. The balance of the Credit Facility term loan is $495.0 million as of September 30, 2016. Of the total amount, $55.0 million is classified as current portion of long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as the date of maturity is less than one year. 
  During 2015, the $25.0 million of 5.660% notes due December 2016 were classified as current portion of long-term debt in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as the date of maturity is less than one year. It is management's intention to repay this debt from operating cash. 
  On March 14, 2016, the Company terminated the Wells Fargo Revolver $25.0 million facility without incurring any fees. The facility was to mature on December 31, 2016. The Company terminated the Wells Fargo Revolver as it maintains flexibility with the Credit Facility revolver capacity and current capital and credit resources available.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  Neither we nor our subsidiaries have ever incurred off-balance sheet obligations through the use of, or investment in, off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments or structured finance or special purpose entities organized as corporations, partnerships or limited liability companies or trusts. 
  For further discussion of our cash management and risk management policies, see  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  
   
  ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity prices. We are exposed to market risk through our investments, revolving credit line, term loan agreements and international operations. 
  Our invested assets are held primarily as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, available-for-sale marketable debt securities, non-marketable debt securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. treasury securities, and professionally managed short-duration fixed income funds. Some of these investments are subject to interest rate risk. The fair values of our invested assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , approximated their respective carrying values due to their short-term duration and therefore, such market risk is not considered to be material. 
  We do not actively invest or trade in equity securities. In addition, we generally dispose of any significant equity securities received in conjunction with an acquisition shortly after the acquisition date. 
  As of September 30, 2016, we had $495.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our term loan, which bears interest on a floating basis tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and is therefore subject to changes in the associated interest expense. The effect of an immediate hypothetical 10% change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  We are subject to exchange rate risk primarily in our U.K. based wholesale brokerage business that has a cost base principally denominated in British pounds and a revenue base in several other currencies, but principally in U.S. dollars. Based on our foreign currency rate exposure as of   September 30, 2016  , an immediate 10% hypothetical change of foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
   
  ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We carried out an evaluation (the  Evaluation ) required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act ( Disclosure Controls ) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on the Evaluation, our CEO and CFO concluded that the design and operation of our Disclosure Controls were effective. 
  Changes in Internal Controls 
  There has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the Evaluation that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  Inherent Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
  Our management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our Disclosure Controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. 
  
   35 

     Table of Contents  

The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. 
  CEO and CFO Certifications 
  Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 are the Certifications of the CEO and the CFO, respectively. The Certifications are supplied in accordance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the  Section 302 Certifications ). This Item 4 of Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains the information concerning the evaluation referred to in the Section 302 Certifications and this information should be read in conjunction with the Section 302 Certifications for a more complete understanding of the topics presented. 
   
  PART II 
   
  ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings 
  In Item 3 of Part I of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , certain information concerning litigation claims arising in the ordinary course of business was disclosed. Such information was current as of the date of filing. During the Company s fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , no new legal proceedings, or material developments with respect to existing legal proceedings, occurred which require disclosure in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   
  ITEM 1A. Risk Factors 
  There were no material changes in the risk factors previously disclosed in Item 1A,  Risk Factors  included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  The following table provides information about our repurchase of shares of our common stock during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  : 

(1) 
    We purchased 56,998 shares during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program, all of which represent shares surrendered by our teammates in the exercise of stock options under our equity compensation plans or to cover required tax withholdings on the vesting of shares in our equity compensation plans. 
              (2) 
    As announced on July 21, 2014, our Board of Directors approved the purchase of up to $200.0 million of the Company s outstanding common stock of which $150.0 million have been purchased with the last settlement on August 11, 2015.  On July 20, 2015, the Company s Board of Directors authorized the purchasing of up to an additional $400.0 million of the Company's outstanding common stock. On November 11, 2015, the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase program with an investment bank to purchase an aggregate $75.0 million of the Company s common stock, all of which has been settled with this latest settlement on January 6, 2016 in which the Company received 363,209 shares. After this completion, the Company has outstanding approval to purchase up to $375.0 million, in the aggregate, of the Company's outstanding common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of 7,793,579 shares have been repurchased since the first quarter of 2015.

 EXHIBIT 10.3 TRANSITION AGREEMENT

exhibit103transitionagre  

FINAL EXECUTION VERSION   Page 1 of 17   TRANSITION AGREEMENT   THIS TRANSITION AGREEMENT (this  Agreement ), effective as of July 1, 2016 (the    Effective Date ), is made and entered into by and between BROWN   BROWN, INC., a Florida   corporation (together with its present and future Subsidiaries and affiliates, the  Company ), and   CHARLES H. LYDECKER, a resident of the State of Florida ( Executive ). The Company and   Executive are each a  Party  and collectively, the  Parties.    BACKGROUND   In connection with Executive s voluntary resignation from the Company in July 2016   ( Resignation ), the Company and the Executive wish to memorialize their agreement concerning   Executive s remaining period of employment with the Company, and with respect to the period following   Executive s departure from the Company. In recognition of Executive s career with the Company, and as   consideration for Executive s agreement to abide by certain post-resignation obligations as set forth in this   Agreement following Executive s departure from the Company, the Company desires to provide Executive   the consideration described in this Agreement in return for the agreements of the Executive set forth herein.   The date upon which Executive s Resignation from the Company is effective shall be described herein as   the  Resignation Date.    The Company, on behalf of itself, its shareholders and its employees, has a compelling interest in   maintaining the confidentiality of Confidential Information and/or Trade Secrets (as such terms are defined   in Section 5(a) of this Agreement), retaining its employees, and maintaining the customer relationships and   business goodwill the Company develops and acquires. By virtue of Executive s position, Executive has   been afforded extensive and intimate knowledge of the Company s strategic goals, including particularized   plans and processes developed by the Company, whether through the Executive s efforts or otherwise,   which are not known to others in the industry and which give the Company and its Subsidiaries competitive   advantage. In addition, Executive has had full access to information concerning the performance and results   of various leaders, business units, divisions, profit centers and Subsidiaries of the Company and information   related to the development and execution of strategic plans, including potential acquisitions, for the   Company and/or its Subsidiaries. Executive s role has been such that the Company s Confidential   Information and Trade Secrets have necessarily become inextricably entwined with Executive s own   knowledge and experience.   NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, agree as follows:   TERMS   1. The Executive s Resignation and Future Relationship.   (a) The Executive s employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries shall end as   of the close of business on July 1, 2016, which shall also be deemed to be the Resignation Date. Pursuant   to a Consulting Agreement in the form attached to this Agreement as Exhibit  A  (the    Consulting Agreement ), the Executive agrees that, after the Resignation Date, he will make himself   available to the Company at reasonable times and locations to fulfill his duties under the Consulting   Agreement. The level of services that the Executive provides after the Resignation Date shall in no event   exceed 20 percent of the average level of services performed by the Executive for the Company during the   36-month period immediately preceding the Resignation Date and, except as set forth in the Consulting   Agreement, shall not extend beyond twelve (12) months following the Resignation Date. Therefore, the   services performed by the Executive after the Resignation Date shall not exceed the level of services   permitted under Treasury Regulation  1.409A-1(h)(1)(ii) under which the Executive is presumed to have   had a  separation from service  (as such term is defined for purposes of Section 409A of the Internal     

/s/ CL____ Page 2 of 17 /s/ JPB___   CHL Brown   Brown, Inc.   Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code )) on the Resignation Date. The foregoing shall not under   any circumstance preclude or interfere with Executive s future employment or activities except as expressly   provided for in this Agreement.   (b) The Executive agrees that he will return to the Company on or before the   Resignation Date all property in his possession, custody or control which he obtained from the Company   or from any of their customers, vendors, current merger or acquisition candidates that Executive is aware   of, employees, contractors or consultants; including but not limited to the originals and all copies of any   documents, files, data or information (electronic or hard-copy), access cards, passwords and file-access   methods/protocols, computers/laptops/PDAs (including all software and peripherals), cell phones and   stored documents/files/information, with all documents, files and information being returned unaltered and   unencrypted.   (c) Executive and Company agree to keep strictly confidential the substance of this   Agreement, including any and all related verbal and written information regarding the Agreement. The   Parties agree that neither will discuss or divulge any such information to any person other than Executive s   or Company s own attorneys or accountants, without the prior written consent of the other, unless ordered   to do so by a court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree that, if they receive   an inquiry from any media representative about the other or Company s current or former officers, director   or employees, his employment by the Company or the end of that employment, the parties will not respond   but will immediately contact the other to inform the other of the media inquiry. Notwithstanding the   foregoing, each of the Executive and the Company acknowledge that the disclosure of this Agreement is   expected to be required by applicable law and that this Agreement is expected to be filed by the Company   with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with its reporting obligations under the   Exchange Act (as defined below).   (d) If the Executive has vested Company stock options or stock appreciation rights   that he wants to exercise, he must do so within thirty (30) days of the Resignation Date unless otherwise   provided in the applicable award agreement(s) and plan document(s). Except as otherwise provided in   Section 2(b) below, any Company stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards or   restricted stock unit awards that are not vested in Executive as of the Resignation Date will be forfeited in   accordance with the terms of the Executive s award agreements with the Company and the applicable   Company plan. The Executive understands and agrees that (a) the federal  insider trading  securities laws   continue to apply to the Executive notwithstanding his Resignation from employment with the Company,   (b) the Company s Insider Trading Policy prohibits the Executive from trading in the Company securities   while in possession of material nonpublic information concerning the Company and (c) the prohibition   against such trading continues to apply to the Executive after leaving the Company. Therefore, the   Executive agrees to abide by the Company trading windows even after leaving the Company until such   time as the insider information the Executive possessed, if any, becomes public.   (e) Executive agrees to resign any positions as an officer and director of the Company,   including any direct or indirect Company Subsidiary, effective as of the Resignation Date. Executive also   agrees to sign and deliver to the Company on the Resignation Date a formal letter of resignation in the form   attached to this Agreement as Exhibit  B.    2. The Company s Obligations to the Executive.   (a) The Company will pay or provide to the Executive the following, all subject to the   Executive s continuing satisfactory performance of his duties through the Resignation Date and the   Executive s signing and delivering the Agreement and Consulting Agreement to the Company:     

/s/ CL____ Page 3 of 17 /s/ JPB___   CHL Brown   Brown, Inc.   (i) The Executive s base salary as earned through the Resignation Date, to be   paid upon the Company s next regularly occurring payroll date following the Resignation Date;   (ii) The Executive s cash balance (if any) in the Company s Employee Stock   Purchase Plan as of the Resignation Date, according to such plan s terms and conditions;   (iii) promptly after the Resignation Date, the papers necessary for the   Executive to elect continuation of any group medical insurance coverage pursuant to the Consolidated   Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act ( COBRA ) and the terms and conditions of the Company s medical   plan; if the Executive elects continued coverage pursuant to COBRA, the Executive shall be solely   responsible for all matters relating to his continuation of coverage pursuant to federal COBRA law,   including, without limitation, the election of such coverage and the timely payment of premiums;   (iv) the opportunity to elect the timing of distribution of any existing account   balance in the Company s Employee Savings Plan, according to the terms and conditions of the Employee   Savings Plan; the Company will not make any further contribution to the Executive s account under the   Employee Savings Plan after the Resignation Date and he remains responsible for repayment of any loans   from his Employee Savings Plan account; and   (v) distribution of the Executive s existing account balance (if any) in the   Company s Deferred Compensation Plan, according to the terms and conditions of the Deferred   Compensation Plan.   (b) In addition to the cash compensation paid in accordance with Section 2(a) above,   the Company will waive, subject to approval by the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of   Directors, effective on the Resignation Date, the remaining time-based employment conditions for vesting   the following 111,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company that were granted to the Executive   under the Brown   Brown, Inc. Performance Stock Plan (the  PSP ) and the 2010 Brown   Brown, Inc.   Stock Incentive Plan (the  SIP ), as applicable (collectively, the  Restricted Stock ):   (i) The following  awarded  but unvested restricted stock awards:   (A) 13,712 shares granted on April 1, 2003 under the PSP;   (B) 8,000 shares granted on February 27, 2008 under the PSP;   (C) 9,316 shares granted on April 27, 2010 under the PSP; and   (D) 33,418 shares granted on January 18, 2011 under the SIP.   (ii) The following Performance-Triggered Stock Grants (PTSGs):   (A) 31,017 shares granted on July 1, 2013 under the SIP;   (B) 9,214 shares granted on January 22, 2014 under the SIP; and   (C) 6,323 shares granted on January 21, 2015 under the SIP.   For purposes of this Agreement, the shares of Restricted Stock, if any, with respect to which the remaining   time-based employment conditions for vesting of the Restricted Stock are waived will be referred to as the    Accelerated Restricted Stock.  Failure of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to   approve the waiver of the remaining time-based employment conditions for vesting of the 111,000 shares   in Executive, as contemplated in this subparagraph 2(b), shall render this Agreement and the Consulting     

/s/ CL____ Page 4 of 17 /s/ JPB___   CHL Brown   Brown, Inc.   Agreement null and void. The Executive will not be permitted to sell or transfer more than 50% (i.e.,   55,500 shares) of the Accelerated Restricted Stock prior to September 30, 2016, subject to the current   blackout period which expires July 21, 2016.   (c) Company acknowledges and agrees that Executive s rights to the Accelerated   Restricted Stock and the $750,000 initial payment made to Executive under the Consulting Agreement shall   not be subject to forfeiture, for any reason.   (d) The Executive acknowledges the following related to compensation paid or   granted by the Company pursuant to this Agreement:   (i) The Executive understands and agrees that the monies and benefits   described in this Section 2 and the attached Consulting Agreement are the sole financial obligations of the   Company to the Executive under this Agreement.   (ii) The Executive agrees that the payment of any monies or benefits under   this Agreement and the Consulting Agreement are subject to deductions and withholdings as required by   law and, further, that he is solely responsible for and will pay all taxes, contributions or other payments to   any taxing authority which arise from his receipt of the monies or benefits paid to him under this Agreement.   3. Mutual Release of the Company and Personnel.   (a) In exchange for the monies and benefits given by each Party to the other under this   Agreement to which the other was not otherwise entitled, the parties agree, on their own behalf and on   behalf of any other person entitled to make a claim on their behalf or through them, that each hereby freely,   finally, fully and forever releases and discharges the other from any and all claims and causes of action of   any kind or nature that the other once had or now has against the other, including without limitations any   and all claims arising out or related in any way, directly or indirectly, to the Executive s employment or   end of employment with the Company, whether such claims are now known or unknown to the parties   ( Released Claims ). Released Claims do not include (i) any claims arising from events occurring after the   Executive signs this Agreement, (ii) any claims which by law may not be released by the Executive; (iii)   any claims of the Executive for vested benefits under the Company s employee benefit plans and (iv) any   rights granted to Executive under this Agreement or the Consulting Agreement executed   contemporaneously herewith. The parties agree that it is his intent that the releases of claims being given   by him in this Agreement are intended to operate as a general release to the maximum extent permitted by   law.   (b) The Executive agrees that he does not now have pending any claims or lawsuits   against the Company, that he has not suffered an on-the-job injury for which he has not already filed a   claim. Further, the Executive waives his right to any monetary recovery should any federal, state, or local   administrative agency pursue any claims on his behalf arising out of or related to his employment with   and/or Resignation from employment with the Company.   (c) The Executive will not affirmatively seek to cause any civil/criminal investigations   or regulatory actions to be taken against the Company. In the event Executive receives a subpoena related   to the Company, Executive shall promptly notify Company and provide reasonable cooperation to   Company. The Executive represents and warrants, to the best of his knowledge and belief, that he has   served in his capacity as an officer of the Company and an officer and/or director of one or more   Subsidiaries and fulfilled all obligations thereof without knowingly violating any governing law. In the   event Executive receives a subpoena related to the Company, Executive shall promptly notify Company   and provide reasonable cooperation to Company. Nothing in this Agreement prohibits Executive from   communicating directly with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or any member of its staff,

The Company has thus obtained, and will obtain, a   valuable economic asset which has enabled, and will enable, it to develop an extensive reputation and to   establish long-term business relationships with its Client Accounts and other entities in the Insurance   Business. Executive has had access to portions of the Confidential Information and Trade Secrets owned   by the Company. If such Confidential Information and/or Trade Secrets were disclosed to or used for the   benefit of anyone other than the Company, the Company would suffer irreparable harm, loss and damage.   Accordingly, Executive acknowledges and agrees that:   (i) The Confidential Information and Trade Secrets are, and at all times   hereafter shall remain, the sole and exclusive property of the Company;   (ii) Executive shall not, at any time, make an unauthorized disclosure of   Confidential Information or Trade Secrets, and shall use reasonable diligence to guard and protect the   Confidential Information and Trade Secrets from any unauthorized disclosure;   (iii) Upon execution of this Agreement, unless the Company gives Executive   prior express permission, Executive shall not, at any time, use for Executive s own exclusive benefit, or   use for or disclose to any competitor, Client Account, insurance or reinsurance carrier, managing general     

/s/ CL____ Page 7 of 17 /s/ JPB___   CHL Brown   Brown, Inc.   agent, and/or vendor of the Company or any other person or entity, the Confidential Information and/or   Trade Secrets as set forth herein including using or disclosing any Confidential Information and/or Trade   Secrets to solicit or divert any Insurance Business in respect of any Client Account of the Company for the   benefit or account of any person or entity other than the Company;   (iv) Following the Resignation Date, Executive shall deliver to the Company,   all Information and property obtained or possessed by Executive while employed by Company in the   Insurance Business, whether or not such property constitutes Confidential Information or Trade Secrets,   including Client Account information and marketing literature, and any electronic data stored on a   computer. Executive shall not destroy or delete any material, including but not limited to any electronic   data stored on a computer, before returning such material or property to the Company or its Subsidiaries;   and   (v) Following the Resignation Date, Executive shall not reverse engineer or   derive independently any Trade Secret or Confidential Information of the Company or its Subsidiaries, nor   shall Executive use in any way Executive s knowledge of any facts pertaining to the Company s Client   Accounts, expiration dates, or the terms and conditions of the Company s or its Subsidiaries  business   dealings with its Client Accounts.   (vi) Executive understands that it is the Company s intention to maintain the   confidentiality of their Confidential Information and Trade Secrets. Executive acknowledges that it is not   practical, and shall not be necessary, to mark such information as  confidential,  nor to transfer it within   the Company by confidential envelope or communication, in order to preserve the confidential nature of   the information. To the contrary, Executive understands and agrees that all such information shall be   deemed Confidential Information and/or Trade Secrets and Executive shall treat all such information as   such.   (vii) Executive understands that the Company and its Subsidiaries have and will   receive from time to time confidential or proprietary information from third parties ( Third Party   Information ) subject to a duty on the Company s and its Subsidiaries  part to maintain the confidentiality   of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes. During Executive s employment and   after the Resignation Date, and without in any way limiting the provisions of this Section 5(a), Executive   will hold Third Party Information in the strictest confidence and will not disclose to anyone (other than the   personnel, consultants and professional advisors of the Company or its Subsidiaries who need to know such   information in connection with their work for the Company or its Subsidiaries) or use, except in connection   with Executive s work for the Company or its Subsidiaries, any Third Party Information unless expressly   authorized in writing by the Board of Directors, the President, and/or the Chief Executive Officer of the   Company.   (c) Non-Solicitation Covenant. For a period of two (2) years following the   Resignation Date (the  Restricted Period ), Executive shall not solicit, in any capacity whatsoever, other   than on behalf of the Company pursuant to the Consulting Agreement, any Insurance Business from or in   respect of any Client Account of the Company that the Executive had direct involvement in or Confidential   Information regarding the solicitation of such Client Account in the twenty-four (24) month period prior to   the date of termination of the Executive s employment with the Company. Executive acknowledges that   unilaterally informing Client Accounts that Executive is leaving the Company shall be deemed prohibited   solicitation under this Agreement. The Parties agree to issue a joint statement regarding Executive s   separation from the Company. Should the Parties fail to agree on the text of a proposed statement, each   Party will designate a neutral representative to draft the terms to attempt to resolve the same.   (d) Non-Interference Covenant. During the Restricted Period, Executive agrees not to   intentionally interfere with the business relationship between the Company and any Client Account that     

/s/ CL____ Page 8 of 17 /s/ JPB___   CHL Brown   Brown, Inc.   Executive had direct involvement in or Confidential Information regarding the solicitation of said Client   Account in the twenty-four (24) month period prior to the date of termination of the Executive s   employment with the Company or any entity with which the Company has maintained a business   relationship in furtherance of its operations in the Insurance Business.   (e) No Raiding Covenant. During the Restricted Period, Executive will not solicit for   employment any employee or independent contractor of the Company, and further agrees that the Executive   will not seek to induce any such person to terminate employment or engagement with the Company for any   reason, including to work for Executive or any competitor of Company. This clause is not intended to   prohibit any other employee of Company from soliciting or accepting employment with an entity with   which Executive is also employed, so long as Executive does not induce termination of employment with   the Company, nor participate in the solicitation of the other employee of Company for employment by   Executive s subsequent employer.   (f) Non-Compete Covenant. For a period of twelve (12) months following the   Resignation Date, in order to protect Confidential Information and the Company s customer relationships   and business goodwill, Executive shall not engage in, or be or become the owner of an equity interest in,   or otherwise consult with, be employed by, or participate in the business of, any of the entities identified in   Schedule 1 hereto.   (g) Preliminary Activities. The Executive agrees that until the last three months of   any time period during which he is precluded from taking any act pursuant to this Section 5, he shall also   not, in any capacity whatsoever, engage in planning, preparation, communications with third parties in   furtherance of potentially later engaging in activities that he is otherwise then precluded from taking   pursuant to this Section 5.   (h) Other Business Activities. Executive is permitted to seek or explore other   employment, partnerships, ownership, management, or other business opportunities with other persons,   companies or entities, so long as it is not expressly excluded by this Agreement.   (i) Related Matters.   (i) Executive acknowledges and agrees that: (A) the Company has recognized   Executive s merit and has promoted, elevated and enhanced Executive to the executive leadership of the   Company; (B) the Company has permitted and encouraged Executive s interaction and the development of   relationships with persons and entities in the Insurance Business and third party stock analysts, Company   shareholders and Company directors; (C) the Company has long-term relationships with its Client Accounts   and other third parties and that those relationships were in many instances developed at considerable   expense and difficulty to the Company over several years of close and continuing involvement and that the   Company is acquiring at considerable expense the benefits and goodwill associated with such relationships;   (D) Executive has carefully considered, and agrees that the provisions of this Section 5 are fair, reasonable,   and not unduly restrictive on Executive, and do not preclude Executive from earning a livelihood or   unreasonably impose limitations on Executive s ability to earn a living; (E) the potential harm to the   Company and its Subsidiaries of the non-enforcement of any provision of this Section 5 outweighs any   potential harm to Executive of its enforcement by injunction or otherwise; and (F) Executive has had an   opportunity to obtain legal advice before agreeing to these terms.   (ii) Executive agrees that if the Company discovers a good faith and   reasonable objective evidence that a violation of this Section 5 has occurred or is imminent, the Company   shall have the right to communicate the terms of this Section 5 to any prospective or current employer of   Executive. In the event that either party has a good faith belief that the other party hereto has violated the     

/s/ CL____ Page 9 of 17 /s/ JPB___   CHL Brown   Brown, Inc.   terms of this agreement, each hereby agrees that to provide advance written notice to the other party s   designee, as set forth herein, specifically stating the grounds therefor.   (iii) In the event of a breach or threatened breach of the provisions of this   Section 5, the Company shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief as well as any other applicable remedies   at law or in equity. Executive understands and agrees that without such protection, the Company s business   would be irreparably harmed.   (iv) It is the intention of the Parties that the terms and provisions of this   Agreement be enforceable to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. To that end, the Parties   agree that if a court should declare any of the covenants in this Section 5 unenforceable, the court shall be   authorized to modify or  blue pencil  the covenants to the extent necessary to cure any legal impediment   to enforcement.   (v) This Agreement does not relieve the Executive of other legal   responsibilities and liabilities that Executive has to the Company under applicable state and federal statutes   and common law. Instead, Executive acknowledges that this Agreement only creates additional rights and   responsibilities for protecting the Company s interests.   6. Mutual Non-Disparagement Covenant. The Parties agree that they will not, directly or   indirectly, disparage the other including, the Company s current or former officers, directors or employees   orally, in writing or in any other manner (such as through the use of emails, blogs, photographs, social   media (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), etc.) or any other electronic or web-based media). Further, the Parties   agree that they will not make disparaging statements or comments in any form, manner or medium about   the other including Company s current or former officers, directors or employees or about his employment   by or end of employment with the Company. Disparaging statements or comments shall be those that meet   the common law meaning of defamation per se under Florida law. The Parties acknowledge that it would   be impossible to monitor or enforce this covenant as to Company s entire employee base of over 7,800   employees. In order to preserve the spirit and intent of the covenant, the Parties agree that this covenant   shall apply solely to the present and future composition of the Company s Leadership Council. In the event   that either Party has a good faith belief that the other Party has violated the terms of this covenant, each   hereby agrees to provide advance written notice to the other Party s designee, as set forth under Section 8,   specifically stating the grounds therefor. Each Party agrees to an in-person meeting, with or without a   mediator, to give the other Party a reasonable opportunity to cure said claimed breach, as a condition   precedent to any action or right(s) against the other Party. If said alleged breach cannot be cured, then both   Parties shall consider said pre-suit meeting as a settlement conference and protected by Section 90.48, Fla.   Stat., and by the Florida Mediation Privilege set forth in Chapter 44, Fla. Stat. This Section 6 shall not be   interpreted either Party from giving truthful testimony under legal process or compulsion, subject to   notification provisions of this Agreement.   7. Waivers, Modifications and Amendments. No waiver or modification or amendment of   this Agreement or of any covenant, condition, or limitation herein shall be valid unless in writing and duly   executed by the Party to be charged therewith.   8.

Notices shall be addressed by certified mail and emailed as indicated below, or   to such other addressee or to such other address as may be designated by either Party:   If to the Company: Brown   Brown, Inc.   220 S.

The   Company s assignees, transferees, or successors are expressly authorized to enforce the Company s rights   and privileges hereunder, including the restrictive covenants set forth in Section 5.

THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT,   BY SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, ANY LAWSUIT RELATING TO EXECUTIVE S   EMPLOYMENT, OR ANY SEPARATION, WILL BE HEARD BY A JUDGE, RATHER THAN A   JURY.   13. Miscellaneous.   (a) Term. The term of this Agreement shall be for a period of twenty-four (24) months,   unless otherwise provided herein.   (b) Waiver. The waiver by Executive, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other   hand, of a breach of any provision of the Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any   subsequent breach by the other Party.   (c) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including all of the Exhibits hereto which are   hereby incorporated herein, and the Consulting Agreement between the parties executed   contemporaneously herewith, constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior employment   agreements or other agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties, with respect   to the subject matter hereof. Any prior agreement between the Parties or their respective Subsidiaries with   respect to the subject matter hereof (other than the Consulting Agreement) shall be of no further force and   effect, and to the extent of any such prior agreements, this Agreement shall be deemed a novation, good   and sufficient consideration for which is acknowledged by both Parties.   (d) No Strict Construction; Descriptive Headings; Interpretation. The language used   in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent,   and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party. The descriptive headings of this   Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a section of this Agreement. The use of   the word  including  in this Agreement shall be by way of example rather than by limitation. Any reference   to the  discretion  of a Party shall mean the sole judgment or discretion of such Party.   (e) Executive s Cooperation. Following the Resignation Date, Executive shall   reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to any matters requiring a vote of   shareholders and with respect to any disputes with third parties, internal investigation, or administrative,   regulatory, or judicial proceeding, and with other matters as reasonably requested by the Company or its   Subsidiaries (including Executive being available to the Company upon reasonable notice for interviews   and factual investigations, appearing at the Company s request to give testimony without requiring service   of a subpoena or other legal process, volunteering to the Company all pertinent information and turning   over to the Company all relevant documents that are or may come into Executive s possession, all at times   and on schedules that are reasonably consistent with Executive s other activities and commitments). If   Executive is subpoenaed or is required to testify or provide a deposition or discovery about the Company   or its current or former officers, directors or employees, his employment by the Company or the end of that   employment, he agrees to contact the Company s General Counsel about the subpoena/demand as promptly   as is reasonably possible. Further, Executive agrees to meet and cooperate with the Company s attorneys   in preparation for such testimony (and, of course, he will at all times testify truthfully). If the Company   requires Executive s cooperation in accordance with this Section 13(e) after the Resignation Date,   Company shall reimburse reasonable expenses incurred by Executive in providing such services as agreed     

/s/ CL____ Page 12 of 17 /s/ JPB___   CHL Brown   Brown, Inc.   in advance, which shall not exceed the actual cost or loss of income sustained by Executive plus any   reasonable travel and lodging costs actually incurred, upon submission of receipts.   (f) Business Days. If any time period for giving notice or taking action hereunder   expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday observed in the State of Florida, the time period shall be   automatically extended to the next business day.   (g) Tax Withholding; Indemnification and Reimbursement of Payments on Behalf of   Executive. Company and its Subsidiaries shall be entitled to deduct or withhold from any amounts owing   from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Executive (including withholding shares of other equity   securities in the case of issuances of equity by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) any federal, state,   local, or foreign withholding taxes, excise taxes, or employment taxes ( Taxes ) imposed with respect to   Executive s compensation or other payments from Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including wages,   bonuses, distributions, the receipt or exercise of equity options, and/or the receipt or vesting of restricted   equity. If any such deductions or withholdings are not made, Executive shall indemnify, defend, and hold   harmless Company and its Subsidiaries for any amounts paid with respect to any such Taxes, together with   any interest, penalties, and related expenses thereto. For avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this Section   13(g),  Taxes  shall exclude Company s or any of its Subsidiaries  portion of any payroll taxes.   (h) If one or more Section(s) of this Agreement are ruled invalid or unenforceable,   such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Agreement, which shall   remain in full force and effect.   (i) Unless required by law, regulation, applicable stock exchange listing requirements   or by a court of competent jurisdiction, it is agreed that this document shall remain confidential until such   time as it is filed, and will not be used for any purpose other than enforcing its specific terms in any   proceeding between the parties hereto, and it is further agreed that any portions of the document not required   to be publicly disclosed shall remain confidential.   (j) Code Section 409A. This Agreement and the monies and benefits provided   hereunder are intended to qualify for an exemption from Code Section 409A, where applicable, provided,   however, that if this Agreement and the monies and benefits provided hereunder are not so exempt, they   are intended to comply with Code Section 409A to the extent applicable thereto. Notwithstanding any   provision of this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall be interpreted and construed consistent   with this intent, provided that the Company shall not be required to assume any increased economic burden   in connection therewith. Although the Company intends to administer this Agreement so that it will comply   with the requirements of Code Section 409A, the Company does not represent or warrant that this   Agreement will comply with Code Section 409A or any other provision of federal, state, or local law.   Neither the Company nor its directors, officers, employees or advisers shall be liable to the Executive (or   any other individual claiming a benefit through the Executive) for any tax, interest, or penalties the   Executive may owe as a result of monies or benefits paid under this Agreement, and the Company shall   have no obligation to indemnify or otherwise protect the Executive from the obligation to pay any taxes   pursuant to Code Section 409A. With respect to the payments provided by Section 2(a)(v) of this   Agreement, the Executive s employment shall be treated as terminated if the termination meets the   definition of  separation from service  as set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h)(l).   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if (a) the Executive is a  specified   employee  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(i), and (b) any payment provided   by this Agreement does not qualify for exemption from Code Section 409A under the short-term deferral   exception to deferred compensation of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) or otherwise, then, to   the extent required for compliance with Code Section 409A, any payments that are not exempt from Code   Section 409A shall be made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, but in no event earlier than   the first to occur of (i) the first day of the seventh month following the Executive s termination of     

/s/ CL____ Page 13 of 17 /s/ JPB___   CHL Brown   Brown, Inc.   employment, or (ii) the Executive s death. Any payments delayed pursuant to the prior sentence shall be   made in a lump sum on the first day of the seventh month following the date of termination of Executive s   employment, and the Company will pay the payments, if any, on and after the first day of the seventh month   following the date of termination of Executive s employment at the time(s) and in the form(s) provided by   the applicable section(s) of this Agreement.   (k) Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which   together shall comprise one and the same instrument.
