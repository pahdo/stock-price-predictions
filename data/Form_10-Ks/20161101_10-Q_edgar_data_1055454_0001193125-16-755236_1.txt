  NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION     The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form  10-Q  and Rule  10-01  of Regulation  S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for
complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which are normal and recurring in nature unless otherwise noted) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The balance sheet at December 26,
2015 has been derived from School Specialty, Inc. s ( School Specialty  or the  Company ) audited financial statements for the transition period ended December 26, 2015. For further information, refer to the
consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Transition Report on Form  10-K  for the thirty-five weeks ended December 26, 2015.  
 During the period January 28, 2013 through June 11, 2013, School Specialty, Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries operated as debtors-in-possession
under bankruptcy court jurisdiction (see Note 3). As discussed in Note 5   Fresh Start Accounting, as of June 11, 2013 (the  Effective Date ), the Company adopted fresh start accounting in accordance with ASC 852. The adoption of
fresh start accounting resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes.    The Company changed its fiscal year end from the
last Saturday in April to the last Saturday in December. The Company has reported its financial results for the period of April 26, 2015 to December 26, 2015 (the  short year 2015 ) on a Transition Report on Form 10-K. As used in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,  fiscal 2015  and  fiscal 2014  refer to the Company s twelve-months ended April 25, 2015 and April 26, 2014, respectively. The December 28, 2014 to March 28, 2015
period will be referred to as  first quarter 2015 , the period from March 29, 2015 to June 27, 2015 will be referred to as  second quarter 2015  and the period from June 28, 2015 to September 26, 2015 will be
referred to as  third quarter 2015  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Collectively, the first, second and third quarters 2015 will be referred to as the  first nine months of 2015 .  
  NOTE 2   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS     In August
2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows.   ASU No. 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in
the manner certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently in the
process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation.   ASU No. 2016-09 is intended to simplify various aspects related to the manner in which share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. This
guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases.  ASU No. 2016-02 requires
lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from leases on the balance sheet. The new guidance requires that all leases create an asset and a liability for the lessee in accordance with FASB Concepts Statement No. 6, Elements of
Financial Statements. This guidance will be effective for periods beginning on January 1, 2019. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
   In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes.  ASU
No. 2015-17 simplifies the presentation of deferred taxes. The new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet, as opposed to being presented as current or non-current. This
guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.   
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (In thousands, except per share amounts)       
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  
ASU No. 2014-09 provides guidance for revenue recognition. The standard s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to
which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In doing so, companies will need to use more judgment and make more estimates than under today s guidance. These may include identifying performance obligations
in the contract, estimating the amount of variable consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. This guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of this ASU on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern.  ASU 2014-15 defines
management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective in the annual period ending
after December 15, 2016. The adoption of this update is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
  NOTE 3   CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE     In the
first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest   Imputation of Interest.  ASU No. 2015-03 requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a
direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. As a result of the adoption of this new accounting standard, Company has reclassified its unamortized debt issuance costs related to its Term Loan (see
Note 13   Debt) as a direct deduction to the carrying value of its debt. The impact of this accounting principle change on the previously issued financial statements is as follows:  
   
   Pursuant to ASU No. 2015-15  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with
Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  debt issuance costs associated with revolving credit facilities are not affected by ASU No. 2015-03. As such, debt issuance costs related to the Company s ABL facility are classified as long-term assets
within the  Development costs and other  line of the Condensed Balance Sheet, which is consistent with prior period reporting.    The change in
accounting principle had no impact on the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income or Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  
  NOTE 4   BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS     On January 28,
2013 (the  Petition Date ), School Specialty and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the  Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) in the
United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the  Bankruptcy Court ).  
      6  

SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.   
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (In thousands, except per share amounts)       
  On May 23, 2013, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Debtors  Second Amended Joint
Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the  Reorganization Plan ), and a corrected copy of such order was entered by the Bankruptcy Court on June 3, 2013. The Reorganization Plan became effective on
June 11, 2013. Pursuant to the Reorganization Plan, on the Effective Date, the Company s existing credit agreements, outstanding convertible subordinated debentures, equity plans and certain other agreements were cancelled. In
addition, all outstanding equity interests of the Company that were issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Date were cancelled on the Effective Date. Also on the Effective Date, in accordance with and as authorized by the Reorganization Plan,
the Company reincorporated in Delaware and issued a total of 1,000,004 shares of Common Stock of the reorganized Company to holders of certain allowed claims against the Debtors in exchange for such claims.  
 For further details on the bankruptcy proceedings, see Note 3 of the Transition Report on Form 10-K for the thirty-five weeks ended December 26, 2015.
    NOTE 5   FRESH START ACCOUNTING     On the
Effective Date, the Company adopted fresh start accounting and reporting in accordance with FASB ASC 852. The adoption of fresh start accounting resulted in the Company becoming a new entity for financial reporting purposes. Fresh start reporting
generally requires resetting the historical net book value of assets and liabilities to fair value as of the Effective Date by allocating the entity s enterprise value as set forth in the Reorganization Plan to its assets and liabilities
pursuant to accounting guidance related to business combinations. Accordingly, the financial statements on or prior to the Effective Date are not comparable with the financial statements for periods after such date. Any references to
 Successor  or  Successor Company  show the financial position and results of operations of the reorganized Company subsequent to the bankruptcy emergence on June 11, 2013. References to  Predecessor  or
 Predecessor Company  refer to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to the bankruptcy emergence.    For further
details on fresh start accounting, see Note 4 of the Transition Report on Form 10-K for the thirty-five weeks ended December 26, 2015.     NOTE 6
  INCOME TAXES     The Company files income tax returns with the U.S., various U.S. states, and foreign jurisdictions. The most significant tax
return the Company files is with the U.S. The Company s tax returns are no longer subject to examination by the U.S. for fiscal years before 2014. The Company has various state tax audits and appeals in process at any given time. It is not
anticipated that any adjustments resulting from tax examinations or appeals would result in a material change to the Company s financial position or results of operations.  
 In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that either all, or some portion, of the
deferred tax assets will not be realized. The realization is dependent upon the future generation of taxable income, reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies, and expiration of tax attribute carryovers. As a result, the Company
had concluded that the realization of a majority of the deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not threshold, and recorded a tax valuation allowance. As of December 26, 2015, the Company continued to maintain a valuation
allowance against substantially all of its net deferred tax assets as it has not generated taxable income during a twelve-month tax year since the emergence from bankruptcy. The Company is expecting to generate taxable income in fiscal 2016
resulting in the partial reversal of the valuation allowances, primarily through the utilization of net operating losses and the recognition of deferred tax assets associated with the disposal of its investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. As of
September 24, 2016, the Company had an immaterial amount of unremitted earnings from foreign investments.    For interim quarterly reporting purposes,
the Company records income tax expense or benefit based on its forecasted annual effective tax rate. As the company typically reports losses in the first half of the fiscal year, the Company will record tax benefit and refundable income tax for
those periods. During the second half of the fiscal year, the Company typically generates income and, accordingly, expects to record a tax provision for such period which may offset some or all of the tax benefit and refundable income tax recorded
in the first half of the year.

SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.   
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
  (In thousands, except per share amounts)       
  The balance of the Company s liability for unrecognized income tax benefits, net of federal tax
benefits, at September 24, 2016, December 26, 2015 and September 26, 2015, was $95, $482, and $517, respectively, all of which would have an impact on the effective tax rate if recognized. The Company does not expect any material
changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. The Company classifies accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as income tax expense in its condensed consolidated statements of
operations. The amounts of accrued interest and penalties included in the liability for uncertain tax positions are not material.     NOTE 7  
STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY     Changes in condensed consolidated stockholders  equity during the nine month periods ended September 24, 2016 and
September 26, 2015, were as follows:      
   In June 2014, the Company revised its fresh-start estimate for the amount of deferred cash payment obligations (see Note 13
  Debt). The change in estimate is related to an increased number of unsecured trade creditors which elected to provide the Company customary trade terms which entitled those creditors to a 45% recovery of their unsecured claim rather than a
20% recovery. This change in estimate resulted in a decrease of $2,992 to the Successor Company s equity and a corresponding increase in long-term debt. This change was incorrectly recorded in the financial statements as $1,565 in June 2014. In
January 2015, the recorded amount was corrected to $2,992. Management has concluded that the misstatements of interim financial statements in the first nine months of 2015 were not material.

  Earnings Per Share     The following information presents the
Company s computations of basic earnings per share ( basic EPS ) and diluted earnings per share ( diluted EPS ) for the periods presented in the condensed consolidated statements of operations:  
   
   The Company had 71 and 72 stock options outstanding for the three and nine month periods ended September 24, 2016, which
were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because they were anti-dilutive. The Company had 73 stock options outstanding for the three and nine month periods ended September 26, 2015, which were not included in the computation of
diluted EPS because they were anti-dilutive.    The Company granted 28 Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs ) on March 23, 2016. As such, the daily
weighed average RSUs outstanding were 28 and 19 for the three and nine month periods ended September 24, 2016, respectively, and zero for the three and nine month periods ended September 26, 2015. The outstanding RSUs were not included in
the computation of diluted EPS because they were anti-dilutive.

   NOTE 9   SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE   
  Employee Stock Plans     Since fiscal 2014, the Company has
had one share-based employee compensation plan: the School Specialty, Inc. 2014 Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ). The 2014 Plan was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 24, 2014 and approved on September 4, 2014 by the
Company s stockholders. On April 24, 2014, School Specialty, Inc. s CEO was awarded 33 stock options under the 2014 Plan. Other members of management were awarded 65 stock options during fiscal 2015, 25 of which were cancelled in
fiscal 2015 subsequent to the award due to terminations of employment. September 4, 2014, the date on which the stockholders approved the 2014 Plan, was considered the grant date, or measurement date, for those awards issued prior to this date.
As such, those awards made prior to September 4, 2014 were not considered outstanding and no expense associated with those awards was recognized prior to that date. There were 68 stock options awarded prior to the measurement date.  
 The 33 stock options that were awarded to the Company s CEO vest as to one-fourth of the options on the first four anniversaries of the date of the
award. The options that were awarded to other members of management vest as to one-half of the options on the second anniversary of the date of the award and as to one-fourth of the options on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the award
date.    A summary of option transactions for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 is as follows:  
   
   On March 23, 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company granted an aggregate of 28 RSUs
under the Company s 2014 Plan to members of the Company s senior management. The restricted stock units are performance-based. A certain percentage of the RSUs will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, with such percentage
based on the 15 day Volume Weighted Average Price ( VWAP ) of the Company s common stock prior to the vesting date. The percentage of RSUs that will vest shall be determined as follows:

SCHOOL SPECIALTY, INC.

  (In thousands, except per share amounts)       
  Any RSUs that vest will be settled in shares of Company common stock.  
 The following table presents the share-based compensation expense recognized for the three and nine month periods ended September 24, 2016 and
September 26, 2015:      
     
   The stock-based compensation expense is reflected in selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expenses in
the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations.    The total unrecognized share-based compensation expense as of September 24, 2016
and September 26, 2015 was as follows:      
   On May 28, 2014, the Board granted 6 stock appreciation rights ( SARs ) to each of the non-employee members of
the Board under the 2014 Plan. On July 31, 2015, the Board granted 6 SARs to each of the two new non-employee members of the Board. Each SAR has a grant date value of $130 and will be settled in cash upon exercise. As such, the SARs are
accounted for as liability awards. Since the Company s stock trading price was less than each SAR s exercise price as of the three and nine month periods ended September 24, 2016, no expense was recorded for the SARs. The SARs will
vest as to one-half of the SARs on the second anniversary of the date of grant and as to one-fourth of the SARs on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant. Total SARs that remain outstanding as of September 24, 2016 are
22.

   NOTE 10   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS   
 The following tables present details of the Company s intangible assets, including the estimated useful lives, excluding goodwill:  
   
   The gross values were determined by the valuation which was performed as part of the fresh start accounting. In addition to
the intangible assets above, the Company recorded $21,588 of goodwill. In second quarter 2015, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $2,713 related to the Content intangible asset, which reduced the net book value of the intangible asset to
zero as of the end of second quarter 2015. This impairment was related to the Company s decision to reduce future investments in digital content and digital delivery for its Agenda product category. No impairment was recorded for the nine
months ended September 24, 2016.    Intangible asset amortization expenses were included in SG A expense. Intangible asset amortization expense for
the three months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, was $901 and $902, respectively. Intangible asset amortization expense for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, was $2,702 and $2,997,
respectively.

   NOTE 13   DEBT   
 Long-term debt consisted of the following:      
    ABL Facility     On
June 11, 2013, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement (the  Asset-Based Credit Agreement ) by and among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Agent, SunTrust Bank, as Syndication Agent, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner  
Smith Incorporated and SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., as Joint Lead Arrangers and Bookrunners, and the Lenders that are party to the Asset-Based Credit Agreement (the  Asset-Based Lenders ).  
 Under the Asset-Based Credit Agreement, the Asset-Based Lenders agreed to provide a revolving senior secured asset-based credit facility (the  ABL
Facility ) in an aggregate principal amount of $175,000. As of August 7, 2015, the aggregate commitments were permanently reduced, at the election of the Company, by $50,000, from $175,000 to $125,000.  
 Outstanding amounts under the ABL Facility will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at the Company s election: (1) a base rate (equal to the
greatest of ( a ) the prime lending rate, ( b ) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, and ( c ) the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 1.00% per annum) (the  Base Rate ) plus an applicable margin (equal to a specified
margin based on the interest rate elected by the Company, the fixed charge coverage ratio under the ABL Facility and the applicable point in the life of the ABL Facility) (the  Applicable Margin ), or (2) a LIBOR rate plus the
Applicable Margin (the  LIBOR Rate ). Interest on loans under the ABL Facility bearing interest based upon the Base Rate will be due monthly in arrears, and interest on loans bearing interest based upon the LIBOR Rate will be due on the
last day of each relevant interest period or, if sooner, on the respective dates that fall every three months after the beginning of such interest period.  
 In November 2014, the Company amended the ABL Facility. The main purpose for the amendment was to provide the Company additional flexibility in its execution
of certain restructuring actions by increasing the cap on the amount that may be added back under the definition of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ( EBITDA ) for non-recurring, unusual or extraordinary
charges, business optimization expenses or other restructuring charges or reserves and cash expenses relating to earn outs or similar obligations.    In
September 2015, the Company amended the ABL Facility. The main purposes for the amendment were to reduce the Applicable Margin for base rate and LIBOR loans, reduce the unused line fee rate and extend the scheduled maturity date. As amended, the
maturity date is extended to September 16, 2020, which shall automatically become March 12, 2019 unless the Company s term loan facility has been repaid, refinanced, redeemed, exchanged or amended prior to such date, in the case of
any refinancing or amendment, to a date that is at least 90 days after the scheduled maturity date. In addition, the amendment provided for the withdrawal of Sun Trust Bank as a lender and the assumption of its commitments by the remaining lenders.
As a result of this amendment, the Company recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $877, which represented the non-cash charge associated with the acceleration of a portion of the remaining unamortized debt issuance costs.

  The effective interest rate under the ABL Facility for the three months ended September 24, 2016 was
3.73%, which includes interest on borrowings of $360, amortization of loan origination fees of $195 and commitment fees on unborrowed funds of $51. The effective interest rate under the ABL Facility for the nine months ended September 24, 2016
was 5.24%, which includes interest on borrowings of $594, amortization of loan origination fees of $584 and commitment fees on unborrowed funds of $244. As of September 24, 2016, the outstanding balance on the ABL Facility was $50,637.  
 The Company may prepay advances under the ABL Facility in whole or in part at any time without penalty or premium. The Company will be required to make
specified prepayments upon the occurrence of certain events, including: (1) the amount outstanding on the ABL Facility exceeding the Borrowing Base (as determined in accordance with the terms of the ABL Facility), and (2) the
Company s receipt of net cash proceeds of any sale or disposition of assets that are first priority collateral for the ABL Facility.    Pursuant to a
Guaranty and Collateral Agreement dated as of June 11, 2013 (the  ABL Security Agreement ), the ABL Facility is secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all assets of the Company and the guarantor subsidiaries.
Under an intercreditor agreement between the Asset-Based Lenders and the Term Loan Lenders, as defined and described below, the Asset-Based Lenders have a first priority security interest in substantially all working capital assets of the Company
and the guarantor subsidiaries, and a second priority security interest in all other assets, subordinate only to the first priority security interest of the Term Loan Lenders in such other assets.  
 The Asset-Based Credit Agreement contains customary events of default and financial, affirmative and negative covenants, including but not limited to a
springing financial covenant relating to the Company s fixed charge coverage ratio and restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, asset dispositions and dividends and other restricted payments.  
  Term Loan     Also on June 11, 2013, the Company
entered into a Credit Agreement (the  Term Loan Credit Agreement ) among the Company, Credit Suisse AG, as Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, and the Lenders defined in the Term Loan Credit Agreement (the  Term Loan
Lenders ). In November, 2014, the Company amended the Term Loan Credit Agreement. The main purpose for the amendment was to provide the Company additional flexibility in its execution of certain restructuring actions by increasing the cap on
the amount that may be added back under the definition of consolidated EBITDA for non-recurring, unusual or extraordinary charges, business optimization expenses or other restructuring charges or reserves and cash expenses relating to earn outs or
similar obligations.    Under the Term Loan Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Lenders agreed to make a term loan (the  Term Loan ) to the Company in
aggregate principal amount of $145,000, including an original issue discount of $2,900. The outstanding principal amount of the Term Loan will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable LIBOR rate (with a 1% floor) plus 8.50%, or the
base rate plus a margin of 7.50%. Interest on loans under the Term Loan Credit Agreement bearing interest based upon the base rate will be due quarterly in arrears, and interest on loans bearing interest based upon the LIBOR Rate will be due on the
last day of each relevant interest period or, if sooner, on the respective dates that fall every three months after the beginning of such interest period.  
 The effective interest rate under the term loan credit facility for the three months ended September 24, 2016 was 10.92%, which includes interest on
borrowings of $3,014, amortization of loan origination fees of $328 and original issue discount amortization of $121. The effective interest rate under the term loan credit facility for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 was 10.85%, which
includes interest on borrowings of $9,312, amortization of loan origination fees of $966 and original issue discount amortization of $356. On September 21, 2015, the Company elected to make a $10,000 prepayment on the Term Loan. As a result of
the prepayment, the Company incurred a $200 early prepayment fee. As of September 24, 2016, the outstanding balance on the Term Loan Credit Agreement was $122,226, net of the remaining unamortized original issue discount of $1,503. The original
issue discount is being amortized as additional interest expense on a straight-line basis over the life of the Term Loan.

  The Term Loan matures on June 11, 2019. The Term Loan Credit Agreement requires prepayments at specified
levels upon the Company s receipt of net proceeds from certain events, including: (1) certain dispositions of property, divisions, business units or business lines; and (2) other issuances of debt other than Permitted Debt (as defined
in the Term Loan Credit Agreement). The Term Loan Credit Agreement also requires prepayments at specified levels from the Company s excess cash flow. The Company is also permitted to voluntarily prepay the Term Loan in whole or in part. Any
prepayments are to be made at par, plus an early payment fee calculated in accordance with the terms of the Term Loan Credit Agreement, as amended, if prepaid prior to October 31, 2016. The Company used $8,053 of proceeds from the third quarter
fiscal 2016 sale of its interest in an unconsolidated affiliate to repay a portion of the Term Loan. This repayment did not trigger an early prepayment fee.  
 Pursuant to a Guarantee and Collateral Agreement dated as of June 11, 2013 (the  Term Loan Security Agreement ), the Term Loan is secured by a
first priority security interest in substantially all assets of the Company and the guarantor subsidiaries. Under an intercreditor agreement between the Asset-Based Lenders and the Term Loan Lenders, the Term Loan Lenders have a second priority
security interest in substantially all working capital assets of the Company and the subsidiary guarantors, subordinate only to the first priority security interest of the Asset-Based Lenders in such assets, and a first priority security interest in
all other assets.    The Term Loan Credit Agreement contains customary events of default and financial, affirmative and negative covenants, including but
not limited to quarterly financial covenants, relating to the Company s (1) minimum interest coverage ratio and (2) maximum net total leverage ratio and restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, asset dispositions and
dividends and other restricted payments.    The Term Loan required the Company to enter into an interest rate hedge, within 90 days of the Effective Date
and for a minimum of three years, in an amount equal to at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Loan. The purpose of the interest rate hedge was to effectively subject a portion of the Term Loan to a fixed or
maximum interest rate. As such, the Company entered into an interest rate swap agreement on August 27, 2013 that effectively fixed the interest payments on a portion of the Company s variable-rate debt. The swap, which terminated on
September 11, 2016, effectively fixed the LIBOR-based interest rate on the debt in the amount of the notional amount of the swap at 9.985%. During the three months ended September 24, 2016, the fair value of the derivative increased
by $95 and a gain of $95 was recognized. During the three months ended September 26, 2015, the fair value of the derivative increased by $50 and a gain of $50 was recognized. During the nine months ended September 24, 2016, the fair value
of the derivative increased by $271 and a gain of $271 was recognized. During the nine months ended September 26, 2015, the fair value of the derivative increased by $41 and a gain of $41 was recognized. The gain or loss related to the
derivative was recorded in  Change in fair value of interest rate swap  on the condensed consolidated statement of operations.    The Company did
not enter into a subsequent interest rate swap after the termination of the above-mentioned interest rate swap.    The Company has estimated that the fair
value of its Term Loan (valued under Level 3) as of September 24, 2016 approximated the carrying value of $122,226.     Deferred Cash Payment
Obligations     In connection with the Reorganization Plan, general unsecured creditors are entitled to receive a deferred cash payment obligation of 20%
of the allowed claim in full settlement of the allowed unsecured claims. Such payment accrues quarterly paid-in-kind interest of 5% per annum beginning on the Effective Date. Trade unsecured creditors had the ability to make a trade election to
provide agreed upon customary trade terms. If the election was made, those unsecured trade creditors received a deferred cash payment obligation of 45% of the allowed claim in full settlement of those claims. As of the Effective Date, the deferred
payment obligations under the trade elections began to accrue quarterly paid-in-kind interest of 10% per annum. All deferred cash payment obligations, along with interest paid-in-kind, are payable in December 2019.

   NOTE 15   RESTRUCTURING   
 In the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the Company recorded restructuring costs associated with the closure or
disposal of distribution centers, lease termination costs and severance related to personnel reductions. The following is a reconciliation of accrued restructuring costs for the three and nine months ended September 24, 2016 and
September 26, 2015:      
   The $93 and $642 charged for the three months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015 and the $642 and
$2,624 for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, were included in facility exit costs and restructuring in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
  NOTE 16   SEGMENT INFORMATION     The Company
determines its operating segments based on the information utilized by the chief operating decision maker, the Company s Chief Executive Officer, to allocate resources and assess performance. Based on this information, the Company has
determined that it operates in two operating segments, Distribution and Curriculum, which also constitute its reportable segments. The Company operates principally in the United States, with limited operations in Canada. The Distribution segment
offers products primarily to the pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade ( preK-12 ) education market that include basic classroom supplies and office products, instructional teaching materials, indoor and outdoor furniture and equipment,
physical education equipment, classroom technology, and planning and organizational products. The Curriculum segment is a publisher and distributor of proprietary and non-proprietary core, supplemental and intervention curriculum in the categories
of science, math, reading and intervention in the preK-12 education market. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Summary of Significant Accounting Policies as included in the Company s Transition Report on
Form 10-K for the short year ended December 26, 2015.    The Company measures profitability of its operating segments at a gross profit level. This
measure of profitability for the segments is a change from prior periods which reported operating income or loss at the segment level. Since the majority of SG A costs are managed centrally and allocation methodologies of these costs to the
operating segments are arbitrary, the Company s chief operating decision maker does not review segment profitability using operating profit, only gross profit. Accordingly, the segment information reports gross profit at the segment level. All
prior periods were recast to conform to this new measure of segment profitability.

ITEM 2. 
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation         Quarterly
Overview     School Specialty is a leading distributor of supplies, furniture, technology products, supplemental learning products ( instructional
solutions ) and curriculum solutions, primarily to the education marketplace. The Company provides educators with its own innovative and proprietary products and services, from basic school supplies to 21 st  century classroom designs to Science, Reading, Language and Math teaching materials, as well as planning and development tools. Through its nationwide distribution network, School Specialty also
provides its customers with access to a broad spectrum of trusted, third-party brands across its business segments. This assortment strategy enables the Company to offer a broad range of products primarily serving the preK-12 education market at the
state, district and school levels. The Company is expanding its presence outside the education market into channels such as partnerships with e-tailers and healthcare facilities.  
 The Company changed its fiscal year end from the last Saturday in April to the last Saturday in December. The Company has reported its financial results for
the period of April 26, 2015 to December 26, 2015 (the  short year 2015 ) on a Transition Report on Form 10-K. As used in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,  fiscal 2015  and  fiscal 2014  refer to the
Company s twelve-months ended April 25, 2015 and April 26, 2014, respectively. The December 28, 2014 to March 28, 2015 period will be referred to as  first quarter 2015  and the period from March 29, 2015 to
June 27, 2015 will be referred to as  second quarter 2015  and the period from June 28, 2015 to September 26, 2015 will be referred to as  third quarter 2015  in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Collectively,
the first, second and third quarters 2015 will be referred to as the  first nine months of 2015 .    Our goal is to grow profitably as a leading
provider of supplies, products, services and curriculum to the education market. After five consecutive years of revenue declines, our revenues grew 2.4% in calendar 2015 versus calendar 2014. Revenue growth continued in the first nine months
of fiscal 2016 with revenues increasing 1.7% compared to the first nine months of 2015. We believe we can continue to drive revenue growth in future years and balanced revenue growth across substantially all product categories is a core objective
for the Company. We expect to achieve this goal over the long-term through an organic growth strategy based on leveraging our strong brand names and distribution capabilities and transforming the Company s sales and marketing to better leverage
our deep category and market expertise. Our growth strategy focuses on both new customer acquisition and the retention and further penetration of existing customers while exploring new markets or revenue streams.  
 In addition to driving profitable growth, our organization is focused on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our operating infrastructure and
distribution network. Initiatives over the past several quarters have resulted in a lower cost structure while also improving service levels to customers. As a result, our SG A expenses declined in both dollars and as a percent of revenue in
2015. This trend continued in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 (down $6.0 million, or 160 basis points). Our operating profit margins improved from 3.9% of revenue for the nine months ended September 26, 2015 to 6.8% for the nine months
ended September 24, 2016. The cost efficiencies realized have allowed us to continue to invest in areas that will drive revenue growth or improve the effectiveness of our operations.  
 Our business and consequently our working capital needs are highly seasonal, with peak sales levels occurring from June through September. During this period,
we receive, ship and bill the majority of our business so that schools and teachers receive their products by the start of each school year. Our inventory levels increase in April through June in anticipation of the peak shipping season. The
majority of shipments are made between June and September and the majority of cash receipts are collected from September through December. We typically ship more than 50% of our revenue and earn more than 100% of our annual net income from June
through September and operate at a net loss from October through May.

Results of Operations   
   Three Months Ended September 24, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 26, 2015    
  Revenues     Revenue of $301.6 million for the three months
ended September 24, 2016 increased by $2.2 million, or 0.7%, as compared to the three months ended September 26, 2015.    Distribution segment
revenues of $256.7 million for the three months ended September 24, 2016 decreased by 1.1%, or $2.8 million compared to the three months ended September 26, 2015. As expected, revenues in the Agenda category decreased by $2.6 million in
the current year s third quarter as we believe schools have de-emphasized paper-based planners and shifted purchases to lower-priced planners with less customized content. Revenues in our Supplies product category increased $1.3 million, or
1.1%, in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015. An important contributor to our performance in the third quarter was the expanding relationship with our e-tail partners, as well as stability within our primary preK-12
education market. The revenues from the remaining product categories were relatively flat in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015. While third quarter revenues in our Furniture category were essentially flat with
the prior year s third quarter, strong order trends continued. These strong order trends have resulted in an increased open order position at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2016 as compared to the end of the third quarter of 2015; as
such, we expect growth in Furniture revenues in the fourth quarter.    Curriculum segment revenues of $44.9 million for the three months ended
September 24, 2016 increased by 12.5%, or $5.0 million, from the three months ended September 26, 2015. This increase was primarily related to the Science category as widespread acceptance of FOSS products, which are aligned with Next
Generation Science Standards, continued in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The Reading category experienced a modest decline in the third quarter of $0.3 million, or 2.8%.  
  Gross Profit     Gross profit for the three months ended
September 24, 2016 was $111.6 million, as compared to $112.7 million for the three months ended September 26, 2015. Gross margin for the three months ended September 24, 2016 was 37.0%, as compared to 37.7% for the three months ended
September 26, 2015.    Distribution segment gross margin was 33.8% for the three months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to 34.8% for the
three months ended September 26, 2015. The decrease in gross margin for the quarter was primarily related to an increase in basic Supplies orders placed through strategic purchasing co-operative agreements. These agreements typically price
basic supplies at lower gross margins. A change in mix within the segment reduced gross margin by approximately 10 basis points.    Curriculum segment gross
margin was 55.5% for the three months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to 56.2% for the three months ended September 26, 2015. Decreased product development amortization year-over-year resulted in approximately160 basis points of
improvement in gross margin. A change in product mix, primarily driven by decreased Reading revenues, contributed the gross margin decline in the Curriculum segment.  
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses     SG A
includes selling expenses, the most significant of which are wages and commissions; operations expenses, which includes customer service, warehouse and out-bound freight costs; catalog costs; general administrative overhead, which includes
information systems, accounting, legal and human resources; and depreciation and intangible asset amortization expense.    SG A decreased $1.2 million
from $65.7 million for the three months ended September 26, 2015 to $64.5 million for the three months ended September 24, 2016. As a percent of revenue, SG A decreased from 21.9% for the three months ended September 26, 2015 to
21.4% for the three months ended September 24, 2016.    Depreciation and amortization expense in SG A was down approximately $1.4 million in the
third quarter of fiscal 2016, as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Compensation and benefit costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 were down approximately $0.4 million as compared to the third quarter of 2015. These reductions to SG A
were partially offset by $0.6 million of additional performance-based incentive compensation expense in the current year s third quarter as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Marketing expense, which includes catalog amortization, was up
$0.7 million during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015.  
      21  

We recognized a net foreign currency loss in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 of $0.1 million due to the Canadian dollar weakening versus the U.S. dollar in the period; this compares to a net
foreign currency loss of $0.4 million in the third quarter of 2015.     Facility exit costs and restructuring   
 During the three month period ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, the Company recorded $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively, of
facility exit costs and restructuring charges, all of which related to severance.     Interest Expense   
 Interest expense decreased from $5.1 million for the three months ended September 26, 2015 to $4.8 million for the three months ended September 24,
2016. This decrease was related to the reduction in cash interest expense of $0.5 million due primarily to a $19.5 million lower average outstanding debt balance in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the third quarter of 2015. Approximately
$12.2 million of the reduction in the average outstanding debt balance was related to the Company s term loan debt. A $0.1 million reduction in unused ABL line fees also contributed to the decrease in cash interest expense. Non-cash interest
and amortization of debt fees was flat at $1.0 million for the three months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015.     Loss on Early
Extinguishment of Debt     In the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $0.9 million related to the acceleration of the
remaining unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the second amendment of its ABL facility. No such charge was incurred in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.  
  Gain on Sale of Unconsolidated Affiliate     In the third
quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company sold its 35% ownership interest in Carson Dellosa LLC for $9.8 million. The Company recorded a gain on the sale of $9.1 million.  
  Change in Fair Value of Interest Rate Swap     The Company
had an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the interest payments on a portion of the Company s variable-rate debt. The swap, which expired on September 11, 2016, effectively fixed the LIBOR-based interest rate on the
portion of the debt equivalent to the notional amount of the swap at 9.985%. The notional amount of the swap was $72.5 million. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the fair value of the swap increased by $0.1 million and, accordingly, a non-cash
gain of $0.1 million was recorded.     Provision for Income Taxes   
 The provision for income taxes was $8.8 million for the three months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to a provision for income taxes of $1.9 million
for the three months ended September 26, 2015. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 of 17.2% was lower than the statutory tax rate due to the partial reversal of valuation allowances related to the Company s deferred
tax assets.      Nine Months Ended September 24, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 26, 2015    
  Revenues     Revenue of $541.2 million for the nine months
ended September 24, 2016 increased by $9.2 million, or 1.7%, as compared to the nine months ended September 26, 2015.    Distribution segment
revenues of $453.7 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 decreased by $0.6 million or 0.1% from the nine months ended September 26, 2015. Revenues from our two largest product categories, Supplies and Furniture, increased by
$2.6 million and $6.1 million, respectively, partially offsetting declines of $4.0 million and $4.2 million in our Agendas and AV Tech categories, respectively. The increased revenues in our  
      22  

Furniture category was related to increased spending on new school construction and refurbishment projects, strong growth in our private label furniture lines, the introduction of new products
and more effective sales and marketing efforts. Furniture order trends have continued to show strong growth while Supplies category order trends continue to show low single digit growth rates as compared to prior year. Revenues in the AV Tech
category are down due to a decrease in demand for the Company s listening devices; in the prior year, the product category benefited from several large orders driven by common core assessments. The Agendas category has continued to decline as
we believe schools have de-emphasized paper-based planners and shifted purchases to lower-priced planners with less customized content. While current year order trends for planners have been consistent with internal expectations, we expect the rate
of decline for Agenda products to lessen as we more effectively address the market.    Curriculum segment revenues of $87.5 million for the nine months
ended September 24, 2016 increased by 12.6%, or $9.8 million, from the nine months ended September 26, 2015. This increase was related to the Science category as revenue for the Reading category was relatively flat year-over-year. Strong
acceptance of the FOSS curriculum, which is aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards, continued throughout the first nine months of fiscal 2016 and contributed to the revenue increase. Product enhancements in the Reading category, combined
with structural changes to our Reading sales organization, are helping to stabilize the year-over-year revenue performance in the first nine months of fiscal 2016.  
  Gross Profit     Gross profit for the nine months ended
September 24, 2016 was $202.6 million, as compared to $197.2 million for the nine months ended September 26, 2015. In the nine months ended September 24, 2016, increased revenues contributed $3.6 million of additional gross profit and
lower product development amortization expense contributed $5.0 million of the increase. Gross margin for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 was 37.4%, as compared to 37.0% for the nine months ended September 26, 2015.  
 Distribution segment gross margin was 34.4% for the nine months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to 35.2% for the nine months ended
September 26, 2015. Reduced product development amortization in nine months ended September 24, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 26, 2015 provided 30 basis points of gross margin improvement. A change in product mix
within the segment, combined with a shift in mix towards vendor-direct shipments versus stock shipment, reduced gross margin in the segment by approximately 70 basis points. The remaining decrease in gross margin was related primarily to a
combination of increased basic Supplies orders placed through strategic purchasing co-operative agreements and lower margins on certain furniture projects in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015. Prior
year Furniture gross margins benefited from a higher level of favorable cost variances recognized in the period.    Curriculum segment gross margin was
53.4% for the nine months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to 48.1% for the nine months ended September 26, 2015. Approximately 540 basis points of this increase was related to a decrease in product development amortization of $3.7
million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015.     Selling, General and Administrative Expenses   
 SG A decreased $6.0 million from $171.0 million for the nine months ended September 26, 2015 to $165.0 million for the nine months ended
September 24, 2016. As a percent of revenue, SG A decreased from 32.1% for the nine months ended September 26, 2015 to 30.5% for the nine months ended September 24, 2016.  
 The Company incurred $4.6 million of expenses associated with cost reduction and process improvement initiatives in the nine months ended September 26,
2015, as compared to $2.1 million in the nine months ended September 24, 2016. Compensation and benefit costs, excluding performance-based compensation, decreased $2.1 million due to lower staffing levels in the first nine months of fiscal 2016
as compared to the first nine months of 2015. Performance-based incentive compensation expense was approximately $3.0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 as compared to $1.3 million in the first nine months of 2015. Variable commission
expense in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was up $0.6 million as compared to the first nine months of 2015 due to the increased revenues. We recognized a net foreign currency gain in the first nine months of 2016 of $0.7 million due to the
Canadian dollar strengthening versus the U.S. dollar in the period; this compares to a net foreign currency loss of $0.8 million in the nine months ended September 26, 2015.  
      23  

Depreciation and amortization expense in SG A was down approximately $3.2 million in the nine months ended
September 24, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 26, 2015 due partially to the prior year write-off of the intangible asset associated with Agenda content.  
  Facility exit costs and restructuring     During the nine
month period ended September 24, 2016, the Company recorded $0.6 million of facility exit costs and restructuring charges, which were all related to severance. During the nine months ended September 26, 2015, the Company recorded $2.5
million of facility exit costs and restructuring charges, of which $2.0 million related to severance.     Impairment Charges   
 The Company recorded an impairment charge of $2.7 million in the first nine months of 2015 related to the amortizable asset associated with the agenda product
category s digital content and digital delivery development efforts. The Company is focused on the print-based agenda products and does not currently plan to continue to invest in the digital agenda product offerings.  
  Interest Expense     Interest expense decreased from $14.4
million for the nine months ended September 26, 2015 to $13.3 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016. The decrease in interest expense was related to reduced cash interest expense of $1.2 million associated primarily with a
$20.6 million lower average outstanding debt balances in the first nine months of the current year. Approximately $13.0 million of the reduction in the average outstanding debt balance was related to the Company s term loan debt. A $0.2 million
reduction in unused ABL line fees also contributed to the decrease in cash interest expense. This decrease was partially offset by $0.1 million of additional non-cash interest expense and amortization of debt fees during the nine months ended
September 24, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 26, 2015.     Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt   
 In the third quarter of 2015, the Company recorded a non-cash charge of $0.9 million related to the acceleration of the remaining unamortized debt issuance
costs associated with the second amendment of its ABL facility. No such charge has been incurred in fiscal 2016 to date.     Gain on Sale of
Unconsolidated Affiliate     In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the Company sold its 35% ownership interest in Carson Dellosa LLC for $9.8 million. The
Company recorded a gain on the sale of $9.1 million.     Change in Fair Value of Interest Rate Swap   
 During the first nine months of fiscal 2016, the fair value of the interest rate swap increased by $0.3 million and, accordingly, a non-cash gain of $0.3
million was recorded. For the nine months ended September 26, 2015, the fair value of the swap increased by less than $0.1 million. As the interest rate swap expired in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, no additional income or loss will be
realized during the remainder of fiscal 2016.     Provision for Income Taxes   
 The provision for income taxes was $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to a provision for income taxes of $2.5 million
for the nine months ended September 26, 2015.    The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 and the nine months ended
September 26, 2015 was 13.6% and 17.9%, respectively. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 reflects the tax benefit related to the partial reversal of valuation allowances associated with certain of the
Company s  
      24  

deferred tax assets. The Company s current estimate of taxable income for fiscal 2016 would allow for the full utilization of both its federal tax net operating loss and its deferred tax
asset associated with the unconsolidated affiliate. The tax provision recorded in the nine months ended September 24, 2016, along with the associated accrued income taxes reflected in the current liabilities of the Consolidated Balance Sheets,
are expected to be substantially offset by tax benefits recognized against the net loss expected to be generated over the remainder of 2016. The tax expense for the nine months ended September 26, 2015 primarily related to foreign taxes and
alternative minimum tax.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 At September 24, 2016, the Company had net working capital of $146.4 million, an increase of $8.1 million as compared to the nine months ended
September 26, 2015. The Company s capitalization at September 24, 2016 was $299.0 million and consisted of total debt of $187.3 million and stockholders  equity of $111.6 million.  
 Net cash used in operating activities was $45.4 million and $54.6 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015,
respectively. The decrease in cash used by operating activities was related to a year-over-year increase in the net income for 2016 and lower average net working capital levels in the first nine months of 2016 versus the first nine months of 2015.
While net income increased by $25.5 million in the nine months ended September 24, 2016, as compared to the nine months ended September 26, 2015, $21.9 million of the increase was attributable to a reduction in non-cash items, most notably
depreciation, amortization, gain on sale and impairment charge. A year-over-year increase in accounts payable of $10.8 million is primarily related to timing.  
 Net cash used in investing activities was $1.8 million and $9.6 million for the nine months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015,
respectively. The year-over-year variance is primarily attributable to $9.8 million of proceeds received from the sale of our investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. For full year fiscal 2016, the Company expects cash used in investing activities
related to property, plant, equipment, and product development to range from $16.0 million to $17.0 million as compared to a full year actual amount of $14.1 million in calendar 2015. The anticipated full year increase is related to the
implementation of a new phone system, which will provide necessary functionality and feature enhancements to our call centers and other key business application tools to improve operating effectiveness. The implementation of the new phone system
began during the nine months ended September 24, 2016.    Net cash provided by financing activities was $40.8 million and $65.2 million for the nine
months ended September 24, 2016 and September 26, 2015, respectively. In both periods, the net cash from financing activities represents combined net borrowings from the ABL Facility, partially offset by paydowns of our Term Loan
facilities. These net borrowings were used to fund the Company s cash used in operations and investing activities. Outstanding borrowings on the ABL Facility were $50.6 million as of September 24, 2016, while the excess availability on
that date for the ABL Facility was $70.1 million. We expect the outstanding ABL borrowings of $50.6 million to be repaid with positive operating cash flows over the remainder of 2016. The Company s remaining gross Term Loan balance as of
September 24, 2016 was $122.2 million.    The Company s ABL Facility and Term Loan contain customary events of default and financial, affirmative
and negative covenants. The Company was in compliance with all such covenants during the three and nine month periods ended September 24, 2016. Based on current projections, the Company believes it will maintain compliance with these covenants
throughout the next twelve months.    We believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings available from our existing credit facility will be
sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for operations, including anticipated capital expenditures and our contractual obligations for the next twelve months.  
  Fluctuations in Quarterly Results of Operations     Our
business is subject to seasonal influences. Our historical revenues and profitability have been dramatically higher in the periods from June through September, primarily due to increased shipments to customers coinciding with the start of each
school year. Quarterly results also may be materially affected by variations in our costs for the products sold, the mix of products sold and general economic conditions. Therefore, results for any quarter are not indicative of the results that we
may achieve for any subsequent fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year.  
      25  

Inflation   
 Inflation, particularly in areas such as wages, healthcare and energy costs, has had and is expected to have an effect on our results of operations and our
internal and external sources of liquidity.     Forward-Looking Statements
