Note 1. Ownership, Nature of Business, and Significant Accounting Policies making edits 

Nature of business:    Community Choice Financial Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries,  CCFI  or  the Company ) was formed on April 6, 2011, under the laws of the State of Ohio. As of September 30, 2016, the Company owned and operated 511 retail locations in 12 states and was licensed to deliver similar financial services over the internet in 32 states. Through its network of retail locations and over the internet, the Company provides customers a variety of financial products and services, including secured and unsecured, short and medium term consumer loans, check cashing, prepaid debit cards, and other services that address the specific needs of its individual customers. 

A summary of the Company s significant accounting policies follows: 

Basis of presentation:    The accompanying interim unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10 Q and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information. They do not include all information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Although management believes that the disclosures are adequate to prevent the information from being misleading, the interim unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10 K filed with the Securities   Exchange Commission on March 30, 2016. All adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair statement of the Company s financial condition, have been included. The results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

Basis of consolidation:    The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of CCFI. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Reclassifications:    Certain amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2015, have been reclassified to conform to classifications presented in the consolidated financial statements for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016, without affecting the previously reported net income or stockholders  equity.  

Business segments:    FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 280 Segment Reporting requires that a public enterprise report a measure of segment profit or loss, certain specific revenue and expense items, segment assets, information about the way operating segments were determined and other items. The Company reports operating segments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 280. Operating segments are components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in determining how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Company operates in two segments: Retail financial services and Internet financial services. 

Revenue recognition:    Transactions include loans, credit service fees, check cashing, bill payment, money transfer, money order sales, and other miscellaneous products and services. The full amount of the check cashing fee is recognized as revenue at the time of the transaction. Fees and direct costs incurred for the origination of loans are deferred and amortized over the loan period using the interest method. The Company acts in an agency capacity regarding bill payment services, money transfers, card products, and money orders offered and sold at its branches. The Company records the net amount retained as revenue because the supplier is the primary obligor in the arrangement, the amount earned by the Company is fixed, and the supplier is determined to have the ultimate credit risk. Revenue on loans determined to be troubled debt restructurings are recognized at the impaired loans  original interest rates until the impaired loans are charged off or paid by the customer. Credit service organization ( CSO ) fees are recognized over the arranged credit service period.

Finance receivables:    Finance receivables consist of short term and medium term consumer loans. 

Short-term consumer loans can be unsecured or secured with a maturity up to   ninety   days. Unsecured short-term loan products typically range in principal from $100 to $1,000, with a maturity between fourteen and thirty days, and include a written agreement to defer the presentment of the customer s personal check or preauthorized debit for the aggregate amount of the advance plus fees. This form of lending is based on applicable laws and regulations, which vary by state. State statutes vary from charging fees of 15% to 20%, to charging interest at 25% per annum plus origination fees. The customers repay the cash advance by making cash payments or allowing a check or preauthorized debit to be presented. Secured consumer loans with a maturity of ninety days or less are included in this category and represented 16.5% and 17.7% of short-term consumer loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Medium-term consumer loans can be unsecured or secured with a maturity greater than ninety days and up to thirty-six months. Unsecured medium-term products typically range from $100 to $5,000, and are evidenced by a promissory note with a maturity between three and thirty-six months. These consumer loans vary in structure depending upon the applicable laws and regulations where they are offered. The medium-term consumer loans are payable in installments or provide for a line of credit with periodic payments. Secured consumer loans with a maturity greater than ninety days are included in this category and represented 11.4% and 13.7% of medium-term consumer loans at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Allowance for loan losses:    Provisions for loan losses are charged to income in amounts sufficient to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses and an adequate accrual for losses related to guaranteed loans processed for third-party lenders. The factors used in assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, the accrual for losses related to guaranteed loans made by third-party lenders and the resulting provision for loan losses include an evaluation by product by market based on historical loan loss experience and delinquency of certain medium-term consumer loans. The Company evaluates various qualitative factors that may or may not affect the computed initial estimate of the allowance for loan losses, by using internal valuation inputs including historical loan loss experience, delinquency, overall portfolio quality, and current economic conditions. 

For short term unsecured consumer loans, the Company s policy is to charge off loans when they become past due. The Company s policy dictates that, where a customer has provided a check or ACH authorization for presentment upon the maturity of a loan, if the customer has not paid off the loan by the due date, the Company will deposit the customer s check or draft the customer s bank account for the amount due. If the check or draft is returned as unpaid, all accrued fees and outstanding principal are charged-off as uncollectible. For short term secured loans, the Company s policy requires that balances be charged off when accounts are thirty days past due. 

For medium term secured and unsecured consumer loans which have a term of one year or less, the Company s policy requires that balances be charged off when accounts are sixty days past due. For medium term secured and unsecured consumer loans which have an initial maturity of greater than one year, the Company s policy requires that balances be charged off when accounts are ninety-one days past due.  

In certain markets, the Company reduced interest rates and favorably changed payment terms for medium-term consumer loans to assist borrowers in avoiding default and to mitigate risk of loss. These reduced interest rates and changed payment terms were limited to loans that the Company believed the customer had the ability to pay in the foreseeable future. These loans were accounted for as troubled debt restructurings and represent the only loans considered impaired due to the nature of the Company s charge-off policy.  

Recoveries of amounts previously charged off are recorded to the allowance for loan losses or the accrual for third party losses in the period in which they are received. 

Change in accounting principle:   As of January 1, 2016, the Company adopted new guidance related to the presentation of deferred debt issuance costs on its balance sheet. Under  the new guidance, deferred debt issuance costs are reported as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt. Previously, deferred debt issuance costs were presented as a noncurrent asset. The new presentation requirements have been applied retrospectively and amounts

Table of Contents  

reported in the December 2015 consolidated balance sheet have been adjusted to apply the new guidance.  The change in accounting principle resulted in a reduction of noncurrent assets of $6,828, an increase in current assets of $13, a reduction of current liabilities of $3, and a reduction of noncurrent liabilities of $6,812 in the December 31, 2015 balance sheet.  

Fair value of financial instruments:    Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value are grouped in three levels. The levels prioritize the inputs used to measure the fair value of the assets or liabilities. These levels are: 

Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.     

Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for assets and liabilities, either directly or indirectly. These inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are less attractive.     

Level 3 Unobservable inputs for assets and liabilities reflecting the reporting entity s own assumptions.     

The Company follows the provisions of ASC 820 10, which applies to all assets and liabilities that are being measured and reported on a fair value basis. ASC 820 10 requires a disclosure that establishes a framework for measuring fair value within GAAP and expands the disclosure about fair value measurements. This standard enables a reader of consolidated financial statements to assess the inputs used to develop those measurements by establishing a hierarchy for ranking the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values. The standard requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the three categories. 

In determining the appropriate levels, the Company performed a detailed analysis of the assets and liabilities that are subject to ASC 820-10. At each reporting period, all assets and liabilities for which the fair value measurement is based on significant unobservable inputs are classified as Level 3. The Company s financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, finance receivables, short-term investments, and lines of credit. For all such instruments, other than senior secured notes, notes payable, and stock repurchase obligation at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements approximate their fair values. Finance receivables are short term in nature and are originated at prevailing market rates and lines of credit bear interest at current market rates. The fair value of finance receivables at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 approximates carrying value and is measured using internal valuation inputs including historical loan loss experience, delinquency, overall portfolio quality, and current economic conditions.   

The fair value of the Company s 10.75% senior secured notes due 2019 (the  2019 notes ) and the 12.75% senior secured notes due 2020 (the  2020 notes ) were determined based on market yield on trades of the 2019 notes at the end of the recent reporting period.

The fair value of related party Florida seller notes payable was determined based on applicable market yields of similar debt and the fair value of the stock repurchase obligation was determined based on a probability adjusted Black Scholes option valuation model. 

Treasury Stock:    Treasury stock is reported at cost and consists of one million common shares at September 30, 2016. There were no shares held in treasury at December 31, 2015. 

Subsequent events:    The Company has evaluated its subsequent events (events occurring after September 30, 2016) through the issuance date of November 10, 2016.

The provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016, also includes losses from returned items from check cashing of $1,665.

The provision for medium-term consumer loans of $13,162 is net of debt sales of $361 for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company evaluates all short-term and medium-term consumer loans collectively for impairment, except for medium-term loans that have been modified and classified as troubled debt restructurings, which are individually evaluated for impairment. In certain markets, the Company reduced interest rates and favorably changed payment terms for medium-term consumer loans to assist borrowers in avoiding default and to mitigate risk of loss.

The aging of receivables at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, are as follows: 

Note 3. Related Party Transactions and Balances 

Certain senior members of management have an interest in a vendor from which the Company purchases telecommunications services. Hardware and services were provided to the Company by the vendor at a reduced rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were  $991 and $335, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $2,737 and $708, respectively. If the Company were to source the service from another vendor, the overall cost of the services may increase. 

The Company has a consulting agreement with a related party for information technology consulting services. Consulting services provided to the Company for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $128 and $94 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $394 and $241, respectively. 

There were no additional significant new, or changes to existing, related party transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Note 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets 

The Company performed goodwill impairment tests for the Retail services segment as required when a portion of a segment is sold.  

The Company sold its interests in Florida II in February 2016 as described in Note 10. The test resulted in no impairment of goodwill. 

On July 1, 2016, the Company entered in to a swap transaction through which it divested interests in Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and Utah, as described in Note 10.  In June 2016, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published its notice of proposed rule-making on payday, vehicle title and certain high-cost installment loans which will restrict the Company s ability to lend to consumers. At this time, we are unable to predict what the final version of these rules will be or their impact on our business. The Company provided a version of a new projection model which was based on the potential effects of these rules as the Company understands the impact at this time. The methodology for determining the fair value was a combination of quoted market prices, prices of comparable businesses, discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques. These items are considered level 3 inputs for determing fair value. 

The test concluded that the Retail financial services reporting unit had an impairment of $28.9 million as of July 1, 2016. 

Intangible amortization expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 was $123 and $377, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $540 and $1,488, respectively.

The revolving credit facility is scheduled to mature on March 30, 2018.  The interest rate is one-month LIBOR plus 18%, and there is a pre-payment penalty if the revolving principal balance falls below 80% of the aggregate commitment on or before December 31, 2017.

Note 10. Acquisition and Disposition of Businesses 

On February 1, 2016, Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCFI, completed the sale of the membership interests of Florida II to Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida III, LLC ( Buyer ).  Florida II most recently operated 43 stores in the South Florida market and was part of the Company s Retail financial service operating segment.  Florida II was an unrestricted subsidiary under the Company s outstanding senior secured debt instruments. 

The consideration for the sale of Florida II included the following: 

1,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company held by Check Cashing USA Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of the Buyer, were assigned to the Company and recorded as treasury stock of $50. In addition, stock repurchase rights associated with the shares were cancelled, resulting in the elimination of a stock repurchase obligation of $3,130.     

The Company was released from liability for two promissory notes totaling $10,112 that were incurred in connection with the Company s original acquisition of Florida II (the  related party Florida seller notes ).     

In connection with the sale, the Company has also provided the Buyer with a short-term $6,000 line of credit, substantially all of which was drawn by the Buyer as part of, or concurrent with, the sale.  As a result of uncertainties

Table of Contents  

associated with repayment of the line of credit, the Company also recognized a $3,000 loan loss reserve that has been included in the loss on sale of Florida II. 

The Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $1,569 on the sale of Florida II, including the goodwill of $5,691 allocated to the Florida II transaction based on relative fair value. The difference between the pre-tax loss of $1,569 and tax loss of $24,062 on the sale of Florida II reflects the difference in GAAP and tax treatment of goodwill associated with an individual acquisition. 

On May 18, 2016, Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida, Inc. ( BCC Florida ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCFI, re-acquired five south Florida retail locations, previously owned by Florida II, from the subsequent purchaser of Florida II. BCC Florida agreed to accept the assets of the five retail locations in exchange for satisfying the Buyer s remaining obligation of the line of credit from the sale of Florida II, which had a balance of $4,821.  The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $296 which is included with corporate expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. 

On July 1, 2016, the Company s indirect subsidiaries, Checksmart Financial Company, Cash Central of Mississippi, LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Alabama, LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Arizona, Inc., and Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., entered into a swap transaction (the  Transaction ) with QC Holdings, Inc., and QC Financial Services, Inc. (collectively  QC ).  As part of the Transaction, CCFI subsidiaries acquired QC Financial Services of California, Inc., which operates sixty retail locations, and thirty-eight retail locations in Ohio, Mississippi, Arizona and Alabama from QC. These new stores were accounted for as an acquisition.  Also as part of the Transaction, the Company transferred to QC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Illinois LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Kansas LLC, Buckeye Title Loans of Kansas LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Missouri LLC, Buckeye Title Loans of Missouri LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Utah, Inc., and Buckeye Title Loans of Utah LLC, and the thirty-three retail locations operated by these entities. 

Other than the transfer of the equity interests and assets, the transaction did not provide for the payment or receipt of any other consideration by the CCFI subsidiaries or by QC, other than customary post-closing adjustments.  In entering into the transaction, the Company and QC each concluded that the fair value of the equity interests and other assets received by QC are substantially equal to the net value of the equity interests and other assets received by the Company.   

The following table summarizes the estimated fair value of the assets acquired at the date of acquisition.

Note 11. Stock Based Compensation 

Stock-based compensation costs for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 were $12 and $115, respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015 were $1,281 and $487, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, unrecognized stock-based compensation costs to be recognized over future periods approximated $32 and $942, respectively. At September 30, 2016, the remaining unrecognized compensation expense was $32 for certain awards that vest over the requisite service period. The remaining compensation expense of $32 is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.09 years. The total income tax benefit recognized in the income statement for the stock-based compensation arrangements was $512 and $195 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

There were no significant stock option, restricted stock unit, or stock appreciation rights during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Note 12. Business Segments 

The Company has elected to organize and report on its operations as two operating segments: Retail financial services and Internet financial services. 

The following tables present summarized financial information for the Company s segments: 

(a) 

Represents income and expenses not associated directly with operations that are not allocated between reportable segments. Therefore, the Company has elected to disclose the gain on debt extinguishment and other corporate expenses as unallocated.     

There were no intersegment revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Intersegment revenues of $1,569 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, have been eliminated. 

Note 13. Income Taxes 

The Company files a consolidated federal income tax return. The Company files consolidated or separate state income tax returns as permitted by the individual states in which it operates. The differences between our effective rate and  the U.S. statutory rate is primarily due to non-deductible expenses, state taxes and changes in valuation allowance. The Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $-0- at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $28,294 and a net deferred tax liability of $8,885. At December 31, 2015, the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $46,441 and a net deferred tax asset of $5,165. A valuation allowance of $37,178 and $41,276 was recognized at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that was more likely than not expected to be realized. In evaluating whether a valuation allowance was needed for the deferred tax assets, the Company considered the ability to carry net operating losses back to prior periods, reversing taxable temporary differences, and estimates of future taxable income. There have been no credits or net operating losses that have expired. The projections were evaluated in light of past operating results and considered the risks associated with future taxable income related to macroeconomic conditions in the markets in which the Company operates, regulatory developments and cost containment. The Company will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in future periods and will adjust the allowance as necessary if it determines that it is not more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets are expected to be realized. 

The Company settled the examination of its 2013 and 2014 federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) during the third quarter of 2016. The $191 decrease in unrecognized tax benefits during the third quarter is a result of concluding the exam. The Company does not believe an increase in its unrecognized tax benefits is necessary as a result of the IRS audit results. 

Note 14. Transactions with Variable Interest Entities 

The Company has limited agency agreements with unaffiliated third-party lenders. The agreements govern the terms by which the Company refers customers to that lender, on a non-exclusive basis, for a possible extension of credit, processes loan applications and commits to reimburse the lender for any loans or related fees that were not collected

from such customers. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the outstanding amount of active consumer loans guaranteed by the Company, which represents the Company s maximum exposure, was $39,117 and $40,552, respectively. This obligation is recorded as a current liability on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. The accrual for third party lender losses related to these obligations totaled $2,864 and $2,610 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company has determined that the lenders are VIEs but that the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs. Therefore, the Company has not consolidated either lender. 

The Company provided a $6,000 temporary line of credit to the Buyer of Florida II as part of the consideration. The line of credit is a form of subordinated financial support that represents a variable interest in Florida II. The Company did not have the power to direct of the activities that most significantly impact the performance of Florida II, therefore, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Florida II and did not consolidate Florida II.  The remaining obligation was satisfied in May 2016 as part of the transaction described in Note 10. 

Note 15. Supplemental Guarantor Information 

The 2019 notes and the 2020 notes contain various covenants that, subject to certain exceptions defined in the indentures governing the notes (the  Indentures ), limit the Company s ability to, among other things, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, pay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase capital stock, incur or assume liens or additional debt, and consolidate or merge with or into another entity or sell substantially all of its assets. The Company has optional redemption features on the 2019 notes and the 2020 notes prior to their maturity which, depending on the date of the redemption, would require premiums to be paid in addition to all principal and interest due. 

The 2019 notes and 2020 notes are guaranteed by all of the Company s guarantor subsidiaries existing as of April 29, 2011 (the date the Company issued the 2019 notes) and any subsequent guarantor subsidiaries that guarantee the Company s indebtedness or the indebtedness of any other subsidiary guarantor (the  Subsidiary Guarantors ), in accordance with the Indentures. The Company is a holding company and has no independent assets or operations of its own. The guarantees under the 2019 notes and 2020 notes are full, unconditional, and joint and several. There are no restrictions on the ability of the Company or any of the Subsidiary Guarantors to obtain funds from its restricted subsidiaries by dividend or loan, except for net worth requirements of certain states in which the Company operates and certain requirements relating to the Company s Alabama subsidiary, Insight Capital, LLC, as a result of its separate revolving credit facility (the  Alabama Revolving Credit Agreement ). Certain Subsidiary Guarantors are required to maintain net worth ranging from $10 to $2,000. The total net worth requirements of these Subsidiary Guarantors is $6.67 million. The Indentures contain certain affirmative and negative covenants applicable to the Company and its Subsidiary Guarantors, including restrictions on their ability to incur additional indebtedness, consummate certain asset sales, make investments in certain entities that create liens on their assets, enter into certain affiliate transactions and make certain restricted payments, including restrictions on the Company s ability to pay dividends on, or repurchase, its common stock. 

As long as the $7,000 Alabama Revolving Credit Agreement remains outstanding, the guarantee provided by Insight Capital, LLC is secured on a second-priority basis by the shared Alabama collateral held by such subsidiary. As a result, any obligations under the Alabama Revolving Credit Agreement must first be satisfied before the Alabama subsidiary can make any payments with respect to the 2019 notes and 2020 notes. 

Note 16. Supplemental Condensed Consolidating Guarantor and Non  Guarantor Financial Information 

The following presents the condensed consolidating guarantor financial information as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, for the subsidiaries of the Company that serve as guarantors of the 2019 notes and the 2020 notes, and for the subsidiaries that do not serve as a guarantor. The non-guarantor subsidiaries are Florida II, CCFI Funding LLC, CCFI Funding II LLC, Direct Financial Solutions of UK Limited and its subsidiary Cash Central UK Limited, Direct Financial Solutions of Canada, Inc and its subsidiaries DFS-CSSC Financial Services LLC, DFS-CC Financial Services (Calgary) LLC and DFS-CC Financial Services (Toronto) LLC, and Direct Financial Solutions of Australia Pty Ltd and its subsidiary Cash Central of Australia Pty Ltd. Each of the Company s guarantor subsidiaries are 100% owned by the Company or its subsidiaries, and all guarantees are full, unconditional, and joint and several. 

23 

Table of Contents  

Of the entities under  Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries  in the tables below, Florida II, CCFI Funding, and CCFI Funding II are  Unrestricted Subsidiaries  as defined in the Indentures. Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida II, LLC was acquired on July 31, 2012, and was sold on February 1, 2016, CCFI Funding was created on December 20, 2013, and CCFI Funding II was established on September 19, 2014. Refer to the  Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries  columns in the following condensed consolidating schedules. Florida II is not included in the September 30, 2016 Balance Sheet as the entity was sold on February 1, 2016, and is included in the Statement of Operations for only the month ended January 31, 2016. The remainder of the entities included under  non-Guarantor Subsidiaries  in the tables below are  Restricted Subsidiaries  as defined in the Indentures governing the 2019 notes and the 2020 notes and, for the periods specified, did not have material assets, liabilities, revenue or expenses. 

The supplemental guarantor information required by GAAP distinguishes between non-guarantor and guarantor financial information based on the legal entities and the guarantor requirements contained in the Indentures governing the 2019 notes, 2020 notes, and the Company s revolving credit agreement. ASC 350-20, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, however, requires that goodwill be allocated to reporting units irrespective of which legal entity the goodwill is associated with.  When a portion of a reporting unit is sold, goodwill is allocated to the business disposed of based on the relative fair values of the business sold and the retained portion of the reporting unit. The sale of Florida II, during the first quarter of 2016, resulted in a reduction of goodwill of $5,691 for the Company s Retail services segment, with the remaining goodwill of approximately $25,344 allocated to Florida II s guarantor parent. The book loss on the sale of Florida II is $1,569 whereas the tax loss on the sale of Florida II is $24,062. For tax purposes, all of the goodwill associated with the original Florida II acquisition is written off, which reflects the difference in the book and tax treatment of goodwill associated with an individual acquisition.

Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations 

Acquisition and Disposition of Businesses 

On February 1, 2016, Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida Inc. ( BCC Florida ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, completed the sale of the membership interests of Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida II LLC ( Florida II ) to Buckeye Check Cashing of Florida III, LLC ( Buyer ). Florida II operated 43 stores in the south Florida market at the transaction date and was part of the Company s Retail financial service operating segment. Florida II was an unrestricted subsidiary under the Company s outstanding senior secured debt instruments. 

In connection with the sale, the Company had provided the Buyer with a short-term $6.0 million line of credit, substantially all of which was drawn by the Buyer as part of, or concurrent with, the sale. As a result of uncertainties associated with repayment of the line of credit, the Company also recognized a $3.0 million loan loss reserve that has been included in the loss on sale of Florida II. As described below, the line of credit is no longer available as of May 2016. 

On May 18, 2016, BCC Florida, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CCFI, acquired five south Florida retail locations, previously owned by Florida II, from the subsequent purchaser of Florida II. BCC Florida agreed to accept the assets of the five retail locations in exchange for satisfying the Buyer s remaining obligation of the line of credit, net of loan loss reserve, from the sale of Florida II.  The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $0.3 million during the second quarter of 2016 which is included as corporate expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. 

On July 1, 2016, Community Choice Financial Inc. s indirect subsidiaries, Checksmart Financial Company, Cash Central of Mississippi, LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Alabama, LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Arizona, Inc., and Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc., entered into a swap transaction (the  transaction ) with QC Holdings, Inc., and QC Financial Services, Inc. (collectively  QC ).  As part of the transaction, the Company s subsidiaries acquired QC Financial Services of California, Inc., which operates sixty retail locations, and thirty-eight retail locations in Ohio, Mississippi, Arizona and Alabama from QC. These new stores will be accounted for as an acquisition.  Also as part of the transaction, the Company transferred to QC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Illinois LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Kansas LLC, Buckeye Title Loans of Kansas LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Missouri LLC, Buckeye Title Loans of Missouri LLC, Buckeye Check Cashing of Utah, Inc., and Buckeye Title Loans of Utah LLC, and the thirty-three retail locations operated by these entities. 

Other than the transfer of the equity interests and assets, the transaction did not provide for the payment or receipt of any other consideration by the Company s subsidiaries or by QC, other than customary post-closing adjustments.  In entering into the transaction, the Company s subsidiaries and QC each concluded that the net value of the equity interests and other assets received by QC are substantially equal to the net value of the equity interests and other assets received by the Company s subsidiaries.   

Retail Platform 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company acquired one hundred and three retail locations, closed forty-one retail locations, and sold seventy-six retail locations.

The following table provides the geographic composition of our physical locations as of December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2016: 

In addition, the Company is licensed to provide internet financial services in the following states: Alabama, Alaska, California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. In the third quarter of 2015, the Company ceased all international operations in order to focus on its domestic operations. 

Changes in Legislation 

In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law. Among other things, this act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and granted it the authority to regulate companies that provide consumer financial services. The CFPB has examined both our retail and internet operations. We do not expect the findings from these exams to result in a material change to our business practices. We expect to be periodically examined in the future by the CFPB as well as other regulatory agencies. On June 2, 2016, the CFPB released its proposed rules addressing payday,

vehicle title and certain high-cost installment loans.  The CFPB accepted comments on the proposed rules through October 7, 2016.  The CFPB proposal anticipates that the final rules will become effective fifteen months after publication in the Federal Register.  When publication will occur in the Federal Register will be determined by the number and substance of the comments that the CFPB received on the proposed rules, but we expect that the final rules will be effective in late 2018 or in early 2019. At this time, we are unable to predict what the final version of these rules will be or their impact on our business. 

Product Characteristics and Mix 

As the Company expands its product offerings to meet our customers  needs, the characteristics of our overall loan portfolio shift to reflect the terms of these new products. Our various lending products have different terms. The shift to a CSO program in certain markets has reduced our portfolios and may result in changes to the accrual for third party lender losses. We believe that our prepaid debit card direct deposit offering has reduced our check cashing fees, however, the availability of direct deposit to the Insight prepaid card as an alternative to check cashing extends the customer relationship and increases our revenues associated with the Insight prepaid card. 

Expenses 

Our operating expenses relate primarily to the operation of our retail locations and internet presence, including salaries and benefits, retail location occupancy costs, call center costs, internet advertising, loan loss provisions, and depreciation of assets. We also incur corporate and other expenses on a company-wide basis, including interest expense and other financing costs related to our indebtedness, advertising, insurance, salaries, benefits, occupancy costs, professional expenses and management fees paid to our majority stockholders. 

We view our compliance, collections and information technology groups as core competencies. We have invested in each of these areas and believe we will benefit from increased economies of scale and satisfy the increased regulatory scrutiny of the CFPB. 

Strategic Initiatives 

On June 2, 2016, the CFPB released its proposed rules addressing payday, vehicle title and certain high-cost installment loans, which the Company expects to be final in late 2018 or in early 2019. In anticipation of these rules, the Company enacted several strategic initiatives focused on consolidating underperforming locations, rationalizing headcount, expenses, and portfolios. The QC transaction, while resulting in a net increase in store count, reduced our retail footprint to enable our ongoing consolidation initiatives. The objectives of these strategic initiatives along with ongoing investments in compliance, risk, and information technology is to position the Company for maximum value post the effective date of the proposed rules. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, our management makes certain estimates and assumptions to determine the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in the process of preparing our financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on the best information available to management at the time the estimates or assumptions are made. The most significant estimates made by our management include allowance for loan losses, goodwill, stock based compensation, and our determination for recording the amount of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, because these estimates and assumptions could change materially as a result of conditions both within and beyond management s control. 

Management believes that among our significant accounting policies, the following involve a higher degree of judgment:

Finance Receivables, Net 

Finance receivables consist of short-term and medium-term consumer loans. 

Short-term consumer loans can be unsecured or secured with a maturity up to ninety days. Unsecured short-term products typically range in size from $100 to $1,000, with a maturity between fourteen and thirty days, and an agreement to defer the presentment of the customer s personal check or preauthorized debit for the aggregate amount of the advance plus fees. This form of lending is based on applicable laws and regulations which vary by state. Statutes vary from charging fees of 15% to 20%, to charging interest at 25% per annum plus origination fees. The customers repay the cash advances by making cash payments or allowing the check or preauthorized debit to be presented. Secured short-term products typically range from $750 to $5,000, and are asset-based consumer loans whereby the customer obtains cash and grants a security interest in the collateral that may become a lien against that collateral. Secured consumer loans represented 17.7% and 16.5% of short-term consumer loans at December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2016, respectively. 

Medium-term consumer loans can be unsecured or secured with a maturity of three months up to thirty-six months. Unsecured medium-term products typically range from $100 to $5,000. These consumer loans vary in structure depending upon the regulatory environment where they are offered. The consumer loans are due in installments or provide for a line of credit with periodic monthly payments. Secured medium-term products typically range from $750 to $5,000, and are asset-based consumer loans whereby the customer obtains cash and grants a security interest in the collateral that may become a lien against that collateral. Secured consumer loans represented 13.7% and 11.4% of medium-term consumer loans at December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2016, respectively. 

In some instances, the Company maintains debt-purchasing arrangements with third-party lenders. The Company accrues for these obligations through management s estimation of anticipated purchases based on expected losses in the third-party lender s portfolio. This obligation is recorded as a current liability on our balance sheet. 

Total finance receivables, net of unearned advance fees and allowance for loan losses on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2016, were $128.5 million and $99.3 million, respectively. The allowance for loan losses as of December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2016, were $23.9 million and $16.9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2016, the allowance for loan losses was 15.7% and 14.6%, respectively, of total finance receivables, net of unearned advance fees, reflecting a higher mix of medium-term loans, which have higher allowances for loan losses. 

Finance receivables, net as of December 31, 2015, and September 30, 2016, are as follows (in thousands):

The total changes to the allowance for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016, were as follows (in thousands): 

The provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and 2016 includes losses from returned items from check cashing of $2.5 million and $1.7 million, respectively, and third party lender losses of $10.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The provision for loan losses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and 2016 includes losses from returned items from check cashing of $7.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively, and third party lender losses of $28.2 million and $19.6 million, respectively. 

Goodwill 

Management evaluates all long-lived assets for impairment annually as of December 31, or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate an asset might be impaired, including goodwill and equity method investments. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets at the date of the acquisition and the excess of purchase price over identified net assets acquired. 

One of the methods that management employs in the review of such assets uses estimates of future cash flows. If the carrying value is considered impaired, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value. For equity method investments, an impairment charge is recorded if the decline in value is other than temporary. Management believes that its estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable. Changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair value, however, could impact the estimated value of such assets. 

The Company performed a goodwill impairment test for the Retail services segment as required when a portion of a segment is sold.  

The Company divested its interests in Florida II in February 2016, as described in Note 10. At this time, the test resulted in no impairment of goodwill. 

On July 1, 2016, the Company entered into a swap transaction and transferred its interests in Illinois, Kansas, Missouri, and Utah as described in Note 10. The test concluded that the Retail financial services reporting unit was impaired by $28.9 million as of July 1, 2016 as described in Note 4.   

Income Taxes 

We record income taxes as applicable under generally accepted accounting standards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the deferred tax asset if it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset will not be realized. 

As of December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a partial valuation allowance on its existing deferred tax assets as it was more likely than not that approximately $5.2 million of net deferred tax assets would be realized in 2016. Based on pre-tax income of $20.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the reversal of temporary

items, the Company had support to realize approximately $5.2 million of net deferred tax assets. In addition, due to transactions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has additional book basis goodwill in excess of tax basis goodwill. As a result, the Company recorded $14.1 million of deferred tax expense and has $8.9 million of deferred tax liabilities as of September 30, 2016.  

The Company settled the examination of its 2013 and 2014 federal income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) during the third quarter of 2016.  The Company does not believe an increase in its unrecognized tax benefits is necessary as a result of the IRS audit results. 

Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries 

As described in more detail under Note 16 to the unaudited financial statements during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had six non-guarantor subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2016, of the entities classified as  Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries , Florida II, CCFI Funding, and CCFI Funding II are  Unrestricted Subsidiaries  as defined in the indentures governing the 2019 notes and 2020 notes.  Florida II was acquired on July 31, 2012, and sold on February 1, 2016, CCFI Funding was created on December 20, 2013, and CCFI Funding II was established on September 19, 2014. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, these unrestricted subsidiaries had total assets of $62.9 million and $89.4 million and total liabilities of $55.7 million and $67.0 million, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, they had total revenues of $45.4 million and $72.4 million, total operating expenses of $26.7 million and $44.4 million, and income before income taxes of $9.3 million and $15.3 million, respectively. 

Florida II is not included in the September 30, 2016, Balance Sheet as the entity was sold on February 1, 2016, and is included in the Statement of Operations for only the month ended January 31, 2016.  

The remainder of the entities included under  non-Guarantor Subsidiaries  are  Restricted Subsidiaries  as defined in the indentures governing the 2019 notes and the 2020 notes and did not have material assets, liabilities, revenue or expenses during the period presented.

Revenue 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016, total revenue decreased by $35.8 million, or 26.0%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a heightened focus on portfolio performance including more restrictive underwriting standards, the consolidation of retail stores,  the sale of Florida II, and the entities divested in the QC transaction. 

Revenue from short-term consumer loan fees and interest for the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased $8.7 million, or 18.6%, compared to the same period in 2015.

Revenue from medium-term consumer loans for the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased $16.4 million, or 41.5%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a heightened focus on portfolio performance and the entities divested in the QC transaction, which resulted in fewer retail locations offering this product. 

Revenue from credit service fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased $6.1 million, or 21.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. Credit service fee revenue decreased as the result of a strategic emphasis on portfolio performance and rationalization. 

Revenue from check cashing fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016, decreased $3.8 million, or 24.4%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to the sale of Florida II and the entities divested in the QC transaction.

Retail financial services represented 76.5%, or $235.5 million, of consolidated revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was a decrease of $66.1 million, or 21.9%, over the prior period, primarily due to heightened underwriting standards, the consolidation of underperforming retail locations in the second half of 2015, and the sale of Florida II.

Internet Financial Services 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total revenues contributed by our Internet financial services segment was $72.2 million, a decrease of $30.5 million, or 29.7%, over the prior year comparable period.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

We have historically funded our liquidity needs through cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and subsidiary notes. We believe that cash flow from operations and available cash, together with availability of existing and future credit facilities, will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. Beyond the immediate future, funding capital expenditures, working capital and debt requirements will depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to many economic, commercial, regulatory, financial and other factors that are beyond our control. In addition, these factors may require us to pursue alternative sources of capital such as asset-specific financing, incurrence of additional indebtedness, or asset sales. 

Nine Month Cash Flow Analysis 

The table below summarizes our cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and 2016. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $103.3 million compared to $153.9 million during the prior year comparable period, a decrease of $50.6 million. Cash flows from operating activities decreased primarily due to the decline in net income, net of the non-cash impact of provisioning and gain on debt extinguishment. 

Cash Flows from Investing Activities.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $70.3 million. The primary uses of cash were loan originations of $62.5 million and $7.5 million in capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $152.7 million, primarily attributable to loan originations and capital expenditures. 

Cash Flows from Financing Activities.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $18.4 million. The primary use of cash was $38.8 million in repurchases of the Company s outstanding senior secured notes, partially offset by $14.3 million in proceeds from subsidiary notes and $6.8 million on lines of credit. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $25.3 million, primarily due to draws on the Company s revolving credit facility.

The Indentures governing our senior secured notes contain certain covenants and events of default that are customary with respect to non-investment grade debt securities, including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions or repurchase our capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, create liens and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies. The agreement governing our $31.7 million revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends on or make other distributions or repurchase our capital stock, make certain investments, enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, create liens and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies, in each case to the same extent as the indentures governing our notes. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with these covenants. 

The revolving credit facility previously due April 2015 was amended in March 2015 to be restructured as a $31.7 million revolving credit facility with an accordion feature that allows us to request an increase in the revolving credit facility of up to $40.0 million in total availability, so long as no event of default exists. The revolving credit facility is a two-year facility that was scheduled to mature on March 27, 2017. The interest rate was one-month LIBOR plus 14% with a 15% floor. The 1-month LIBOR rate was 0.52% and 0.24% at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively, and the prime rate was 3.50% and 3.25% at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. The revolving credit facility includes an undrawn line fee of 3.0% of the unused commitments. 

On October 27, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment and extension of its existing revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility, which was fully drawn at the closing of the amendment, is now structured as a $30.0 million revolving credit facility with an accordion feature that, so long as no default exists, allows the Company to request an increase in the revolving credit facility of up to $40.0 million in total availability. The revolving credit facility is a scheduled to mature on March 30, 2018.  The interest rate is one-month LIBOR plus 18%, and there is a pre-payment penalty if the revolving principal balance falls below 85% of the aggregate commitment on or before December 31, 2017.  The covenants and borrowing base have not been amended. 

The Alabama revolving credit facility was renewed in February 2016 with a maturity of July 2017. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repurchased $103.9 million of our senior secured notes resulting in a $65.1 million gain on debt extinguishment. We may continue to repurchase our outstanding debt, including in the open market through privately negotiated transactions, by exercising redemption rights or otherwise and any such repurchases may be material. 

Capital Expenditures 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company spent $16.3 million on capital expenditures to fund new store growth. During the comparable period in 2016, the Company had ceased opening new stores and focused on maintaining existing stores and, therefore, capital expenditures declined to $7.5 million. 

Seasonality 

Our business is seasonal based on the liquidity and cash flow needs of our customers. Customers cash tax refund checks primarily in the first calendar quarter of each year which is traditionally our strongest check cashing quarter. We typically see our loan portfolio decline in the first quarter as a result of the consumer liquidity created through income tax refunds. Following the first quarter, we typically see our loan portfolio expand through the remainder of the year with the third and fourth quarters showing the strongest loan demand due to the holiday season. 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 

On December 20, 2013 and September 19, 2014, we created non-guarantor subsidiaries in order to fund growth in our internet portfolios. The non-guarantor subsidiary funding came from $35.0 million and $7.4 million subsidiary notes, which were used to purchase loans from guarantor subsidiaries. The $35.0 million subsidiary note was amended to

Table of Contents  

$40.0 million and extended to January 2018 on June 1, 2016, and the $7.4 million subsidiary note was amended to $8.1 million on April 20, 2016. 

On July 19, 2014, a guarantor subsidiary of ours entered in to a $1.4 million term note with a non-related entity for the acquisition of a share of an airplane. We recorded our $1.1 million share of the joint note, but both parties are joint and severally liable. The joint note had an outstanding balance of $1.3 million at September 30, 2016 and our share of the note was $1.0 million. 

On May 24, 2016, a guarantor subsidiary of the Company entered in to a $1.2 million term note for a fractional share of an airplane. 

Impact of Inflation 

Our results of operations are not materially impacted by fluctuations in inflation. 

Balance Sheet Variations 

Cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable, accrued liabilities, money orders payable and revolving advances vary because of seasonal and day-to-day requirements resulting primarily from maintaining cash for cashing checks and making loans, and the receipt and remittance of cash from the sale of prepaid debit cards, wire transfers, money orders and the processing of bill payments. 

Loan Portfolio 

As of September 30, 2016, we offered loans in 35 states.  We have established a loan loss allowance in respect of our loans receivable at a level that our management believes to be adequate to absorb known or probable losses from loans made by us and accruals for losses in respect of loans made by third parties. Our policy for determining the loan loss allowance is based on historical experience, as well as our management s review and analysis of the payment and collection of the loans within prior periods. All loans and services, regardless of type, are made in accordance with state regulations, and, therefore, the terms of the loans and services may vary from state to state. Loan fees and interest are earned on loans. Products which allow for an upfront fee are recognized over the loan term. Other products  interest is earned over the term of the loan. 

As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, our total finance receivables net of unearned advance fees were approximately $116.2 million and $152.4 million, respectively. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

In certain markets, we arrange for consumers to obtain consumer loan products from one of several independent third-party lenders whereby we act as a facilitator. For consumer loan products originated by third-party lenders under these programs, each lender is responsible for providing the criteria by which the consumer s application is underwritten and, if approved, determining the amount of the consumer loan. We are responsible for assessing whether or not we will guarantee such loans. When a consumer executes an agreement with us under these programs, we agree, for a fee payable to us by the consumer, to provide certain services to the consumer, one of which is to guarantee the consumer s obligation to repay the loan received by the consumer from the third-party lender if the consumer fails to do so. The guarantee represents an obligation to purchase specific loans that go into default. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the outstanding amount of active consumer loans guaranteed by us was $39.1 million and $40.6 million, respectively. The accrual for third party loan losses, which represents the estimated fair value of the liability for estimated losses on consumer loans guaranteed by us, was $2.9 million and $2.6 million as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.   

As of September 30, 2016, we have no material market risk sensitive instruments entered into for trading or other purposes, as defined by GAAP.

Table of Contents  

Interest rate risk 

The cash and cash equivalents reflected on our balance sheet represent largely uninvested cash in our branches and cash-in-transit. The amount of interest income we earn on these funds will decline with a decline in interest rates. However, due to the short-term nature of short-term investment grade securities and money market accounts, an immediate decline in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had $335.7 million of indebtedness, of which, $33.95 million outstanding under our revolving credit facilities is subject to variable interest rates based on Prime and LIBOR rates. In addition, we have an additional $4.1 million of undrawn availability under the lines of credit which are subject to variable interest rates. 

ITEM 4.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the  Exchange Act,  that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. The Company s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016. 

Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION   

ITEM 1.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.   

We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal, administrative, regulatory and government proceedings, claims and inquiries arising in the normal course of business. While the results of these proceedings, claims and inquiries cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Further, legal proceedings have and may in the future be instituted against us that purport to be class actions or multiparty litigation. In most of these instances, we believe that these actions are subject to arbitration agreements and that the plaintiffs are compelled to arbitrate with us on an individual basis. In the event that a lawsuit purports to be a class action, the amount of damages for which we might be responsible is uncertain. In addition, any such amount would depend upon proof of the allegations and on the number of persons who constitute the class of affected persons. 

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.   

With the exception of risk that may arise from our concentration in certain markets since the swap transaction discussed in Note 10, which is addressed in this section 1A, there has been no material changes with respect to the risk factors disclosed under the  Item 1A Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

A significant portion of our revenue is generated in California and a limited number of other states.  

As of December 31, 2015, approximately 10.6% of our total gross finance receivables were held in Alabama, 9.1% were held in Arizona, 36.4% were held in California, 5.2% were held in Florida, and 9.4% were held in Virginia. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 11.9% of our total gross finance receivables were held in Alabama, 9.5% were held in Arizona, 44.4% were held in California, 3.0% were held in Florida, and 8.8% were held in Virginia. With the completion of the swap transaction with QC, we have increased our retail presence in California by 8.0%. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of loans guaranteed by us was $40.6 million, of which 84.1% were related to Ohio business. As a result, if any of the events noted in the  Item 1A. Risk Factors  section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 were to occur that impact our stores in these states, including changes in the regulatory environment, or if the economic conditions in any of these states were to worsen, any such event could significantly reduce our revenue and cash flow and materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition or could make the continuance of our current business impractical, unprofitable or impossible.

A Claims Notice must describe the Liability Claim in reasonable detail and must indicate the amount, calculated in good faith and to the extent feasible, of the Loss that has been or may be suffered by the Indemnified Party.  No delay in or failure to give a Claims Notice by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this   Section 9.9(a)   will adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies that the Indemnified Party has under this Agreement or alter or relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligation to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent that such delay or failure has not materially prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.     

(b) 
			 The Indemnifying Party has the right, exercisable by written notice to the Indemnified Party within fifteen (15) days after receipt of a Claims Notice from an Indemnified Party of the commencement or assertion of any Liability Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this   Article IX  , to assume and conduct the defense of such Liability Claim in accordance with the limits set forth in this Agreement with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, provided that the (i) defense of such Liability Claim by the Indemnifying Party will not, in the reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party, have a Material Adverse Effect on the Indemnified Party; (ii) Liability Claim solely seeks (and continues to seek) monetary damages; (iii) Liability Claim does not include criminal charges; and (iv)   Indemnifying Party expressly acknowledges in writing its responsibility for all Losses relating to such Liability Claim subject to indemnification by the Indemnifying Party under   Section 9.2   or   Section 9.3  ,    as applicable (it being understood that the foregoing written acknowledgement may contain a reservation of the Indemnifying Party s right to dispute the entitlement to indemnification until such Liability Claim is proven to constitute Losses)   (the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) are, collectively, the    Litigation Conditions   ).  If the Indemnifying Party does not assume the defense of a Liability Claim in accordance with this   Section 9.9(b)   within 15 days after receipt of a Claims Notice from the Indemnified Party of the commencement or assertion of any Liability Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this   Article IX  , the Indemnified Party may continue to defend the Liability Claim.  If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Liability Claim as provided in this   Section 9.9(b)  , the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of the Liability Claim;   provided  ,    however  , that if any of the Litigation Conditions ceases to be met, the Indemnified Party may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable costs or expenses paid or incurred thereafter in connection with such defense to the extent constituting Losses.  The Indemnifying Party or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be, has the right to participate in (but not control), at its own expense, the defense of any Liability Claim that the other is defending as provided in this Agreement.  The Indemnifying     

54 

Party, if it has assumed the defense of any Liability Claim as provided in this Agreement, may, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any such Liability Claim;   provided  ,    however  , that the Indemnifying Party may not consent to any such settlement or judgment to the extent that any such settlement or judgment (I) does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or the plaintiff to the Indemnified Party of a complete and irrevocable release from all liability in respect of such Liability Claim, (II) grants any injunctive or equitable relief or (III) may reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on the affected business of the Indemnified Party.  The Indemnified Party has the right to settle any Liability Claim, the defense of which has not been assumed by the Indemnifying Party, upon prior notice to the Indemnifying Party and, upon request of the Indemnifying Party, after discussion of such settlement with the Indemnifying Party, unless the defense of such Litigation Claim by the Indemnifying Party was not permitted due to the existence of the Litigation Conditions described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the definition thereof, in which case the Indemnified Party shall be required to obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), prior to settling any such Liability Claim notwithstanding that the Indemnifying Party had not assumed the defense thereof. 

(c) 
			 Notwithstanding the provisions of   Section 10.10  , each Party consents to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any court in which a Proceeding is brought by another Person not party to this Agreement against any Indemnified Party for purposes of any claim that such Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement with respect to the Proceeding or the matters alleged therein.  Each Party consents and agrees that process may be served on it with respect to such a claim anywhere in the United States of America.     

(d) 
			 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the limitations set forth in this   Article IX   shall not apply to any Losses incurred by an Indemnified Party which are due to any fraudulent acts, omissions, or misconduct committed by any Indemnifying Party.     

(e) 
			 Any Indemnified Party shall take commercially reasonable steps to mitigate its Losses as soon as reasonably practicable after such party becomes aware of any event or condition that results in or would reasonably be expected to result in any such Losses.
