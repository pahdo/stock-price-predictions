NOTE
1   NATURE OF OPERATIONS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND LIQUIDITY   

Nature
of Operations   

 MYOS RENS Technology Inc. is an emerging bionutrition
and biotherapeutics company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of products that improve muscle health
and function. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 11, 2007. On March 17, 2016, the Company
merged with its wholly-owned subsidiary and changed its name from MYOS Corporation to MYOS RENS Technology Inc. As used in these
financial statements, the terms the  Company ,  MYOS ,  our , or  we , refer to
MYOS RENS Technology Inc. and its subsidiary, unless the context indicates otherwise. On February 25, 2011, the Company entered
into an agreement to acquire the intellectual property for Fortetropin   , our proprietary active ingredient from
Peak Wellness, Inc. 

Our commercial focus
is to leverage our clinical data to develop multiple products to target the large, but currently underserved, markets focused
on muscle health. The sales channels through which we sell our products are evolving. The first product we introduced was MYO-T12,
which was sold in the sports nutrition market. MYO-T12 is a proprietary formula containing Fortetropin and other ingredients.
The formula was sold under the brand name MYO-T12 and later as MYO-X through an exclusive distribution agreement with Maximum
Human Performance ( MHP ). The exclusive distribution agreement with MHP terminated in March 2015 and the Company
does not expect any future sales to MHP. 

In February 2014,
we expanded our commercial operations into the age management market through a distribution agreement with Cenegenics Product
and Lab Services, LLC ( Cenegenics ), under which Cenegenics distributes a proprietary formulation containing Fortetropin
which it previously purchased from the Company through its age management centers and its community of physicians focused on treating
a growing population of patients focused on proactively addressing age-related health and wellness concerns. On November 28, 2014,
we entered into a settlement agreement with Cenegenics wherein we agreed to accept $1,900 by April 2016, in full satisfaction
of Cenegenics  outstanding obligations with respect to units of product produced by the Company, including units that had
not yet been shipped to Cenegenics at the time of the settlement agreement. During the second quarter of 2015, Cenegenics accepted
delivery of the remaining units that we were storing on its behalf. Given the settlement agreement s extended payment schedule,
the Company deferred the revenue and related costs and recorded the revenue and cost of sales as the payments were received in
full through April 2016. The distribution agreement with Cenegenics expires in December 2016. 

During
the second quarter of 2015 we launched R  Muscle Health TM , our own direct-to-consumer portfolio of muscle health
bars, meal replacement shakes and daily supplement powders each powered by a full 6.6 gram single serving dose of Fortetropin.
Our R  Muscle Health products are sold through our e-commerce website, remusclehealth.com, and amazon.com.  

We
continue to pursue additional distribution and branded sales opportunities. We expect to continue developing our own core branded
products in markets such as functional foods, sports and fitness nutrition and rehab and restorative health and to pursue international
sales opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure distribution arrangements on terms acceptable to
the Company, or that we will be able to generate significant sales of our current and future branded products.  

Strategic
Investment Transaction   

  On
December 17, 2015, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with RENS Technology
Inc. (the  Purchaser ), pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to invest $20.25 million in the Company (the  Financing )
in exchange for (i) an aggregate of 3,537,037 shares (the  Shares ) of the Company s common stock, par value
$0.001 per share ( Common Stock ), and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 884,259 shares of Common Stock (the
 Warrants , and together with the Shares, the  Securities ). The Purchaser agreed to purchase the Securities
in three tranches over twenty-four months. In the first tranche, which closed on March 3, 2016, the Purchaser acquired 1,500,000
Shares and a warrant to purchase 375,000 shares of Common Stock (the  First Closing Warrant ) for $5.25 million. In
the second tranche, which we had expected to close in September 2016, the Purchaser would have acquired 925,926 Shares and a warrant
to purchase 231,481 shares of Common Stock (the  Second Closing Warrant ) for $5.0 million. In the third tranche,
which we had expected to close within eighteen months of the closing of the second tranche, the Purchaser would have acquired
1,111,111 Shares and a warrant to purchase 277,778 shares of Common Stock (the  Third Closing Warrant ) for $10.0
million. Each of the Warrants would have been immediately exercisable upon issuance, would expire five years after issuance and
would have the following exercise prices: (a) $7.00 per share for the First Closing Warrant, (b) $10.80 per share for the Second
Closing Warrant and (c) $18.00 per share for the Third Closing Warrant. In addition, the Company agreed: (i) that the Purchaser
would have the right to appoint four persons to the Company s board of directors, subject to adjustment based on the Purchaser s
ownership percentage of the Company; (ii) to provide the Purchaser with a right to participate in 50% (or 100% if shares are to
be issued for less than $3.50 per share) of any future financings pursued by the Company within 12 months from the closing of
the third tranche of the Financing; and, (iii) until the closing of the third tranche, the Company would not take certain actions,
including issuing shares (except for certain permitted issuances) or appointing new officers and directors, without the Purchaser s
consent (collectively the  Purchaser s Rights ).

   September
30, 2016   

   (Unaudited;
amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)   

On August 19, 2016, the Purchaser notified the Company
that it did not intend to fulfill its obligation to fund the second tranche of the Financing, notwithstanding its confirmation
to the Company in June 2016 that it would provide such funding in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The Company
has had subsequent discussions with the Purchaser regarding its breach of the terms of the Purchase Agreement and is reviewing
all of its options, including legal options, against the Purchaser for its breach of the terms of the Purchase Agreement. 

The Purchase Agreement provides that in the event that
the Purchaser notifies the Company that it does not intend to fund the Second Closing Subscription Amount, the Purchaser is required
to take all requisite action to cause the resignation or removal of one of its designees on the Board of Directors of the Company.
Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, effective August 23, 2016, Guiying Zhao resigned as a director of the Company.
In addition, the Purchaser s Rights terminated effective August 19, 2016. 

Liquidity  

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash of $2,889
to meet current obligations and working capital of $3,621 (current assets of $4,805, less current liabilities of $1,184). We have
incurred net losses since our inception. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our net loss was $866 and $1,294,
respectively, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, our net loss was $3,589 and $3,780, respectively. In addition,
net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,030 and $1,971, respectively.
At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $27,034 and $23,445, respectively. At September 30,
2016, we had outstanding borrowings of $575 under a convertible note (See NOTE 6   Debt   Convertible Note). 

As of the filing date of this Form 10-Q, the Company s
management believes that there is not sufficient capital resources from operations and existing financing arrangements in order
to meet operating expenses for the next twelve months. The Company will need to seek additional funding through public or private
financing or through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners as the Company expects that it will continue to incur
losses for the immediate future. The Company s management believes the Company s ability to finance future cash needs
from its operations depends on its ability to sustain and grow revenue of the new strategic rebranding as well as the Company s
ability to access capital markets when necessary to accomplish the Company s strategic objectives. However, there can be
no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts, or if they are, that such efforts will be adequate to meet
the Company s short-term capital requirements. These facts raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to
continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation   

  The
accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited consolidated financial
statements, and the unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial
statements have been condensed or omitted herein. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented
herein reflect all normal adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation of the statement
of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The Company is responsible for the
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. The results of any interim period are not
necessarily indicative of the results for the full year.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

  The
accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of MYOS RENS Technology Inc.
and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Atlas Acquisition Corp. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.  

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
equity and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statement and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It
is possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial
statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future non-conforming
events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ significantly from estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates
include but are not limited to the valuation of stock-based awards, revenue recognition, measurement of allowances for doubtful
accounts and inventory reserves, the selection of asset useful lives, fair value estimations used to test long-lived assets, including
intangibles, impairments and provisions necessary for assets and liabilities. The Company has recorded minimal sales during the
past nine consecutive quarters. Management s estimates, including evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets and inventory
reserves are based in part on forecasted future results. A variety of factors could cause actual results to differ from forecasted
results and these differences could have a significant effect on asset carrying amounts.

TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   September

   (Unaudited;
amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)   

Cash
  Cash Equivalents   

  As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had cash of $2,889 and $879, respectively. The Company considers all
highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less and money market accounts to be cash equivalents.
At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash equivalents.  

The
Company maintains its bank accounts with high credit quality financial institutions and has never experienced any losses related
to these bank accounts. The Company minimizes its credit risk associated with cash by periodically evaluating the credit quality
of its financial institutions. The balance at times may exceed federally insured limits.  

Concentrations
of Risk, Significant Customers and Significant Supplier   

 Management regularly reviews accounts receivable
and if necessary, establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects management s best estimate of amounts that
may not be collectible based on historical collection experience and specific customer information. At September 30, 2016 there
was no such allowance and the allowance was $390 at December 31, 2015. Bad debt expense recognized as a result of an allowance
for doubtful accounts is classified under selling, general and administrative expenses in the statements of operations. There
were no bad debt expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Based on historical collection experience and
other factors, during the three months ended September 30, 2015, management determined that the Cenegenics allowance for doubtful
accounts should be reduced to $97. Accordingly, a reduction in bad debt expense of $98 and $293 was recorded for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had the following concentrations of net accounts receivable with customers:  

The
Company currently relies on one third-party manufacturer to produce Fortetropin (see NOTE 12   Commitments and Contingencies
- Supply Agreement). This manufacturer purchases all the needed raw materials from suppliers and coordinates any additional production
steps with third-parties. We have multiple vendors for blending, packaging and labeling of our products.  

Inventories   

  Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis.  

Fixed
Assets   

  Fixed
assets are stated at cost and depreciated to their estimated residual value over their estimated useful lives of 3 to 7 years.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset's useful life or the contractual remaining lease term including
expected renewals. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are reversed
from the accounts and the resulting gains or losses are included in the statements of operations.  

Depreciation
is provided using the straight-line method for all fixed assets.  

We
review our fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset
may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of future undiscounted net cash flows of the related assets or groups of assets over
their remaining lives in measuring whether the assets are recoverable. If the assets are determined to be unrecoverable, an impairment
loss is calculated by determining the difference between the carrying values and the estimated fair value. We did not consider
any of our fixed assets to be impaired during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

   NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

   September
30, 2016   

   (Unaudited;
amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)   

Intangible
Assets    

  The
Company s intangible assets consist primarily of intellectual property pertaining to Fortetropin, including its formula,
trademarks, trade secrets, patent application and domain names, which was determined to have a fair value of $2,000 as of December
31, 2011. Based on expansion into new markets and introduction of new formulas, management determined that the intellectual property
had a finite useful life of ten (10) years and began amortizing the asset over its estimated useful life beginning April 2014.  

In
July 2014, the Company  acquired the United States patent application for the manufacture
of Fortetropin from  Deutsches Institut fur Lebensmitteltechnik e.V. - the German Institute for Food Technologies ( DIL ).
The cost of the patent application, which was granted in August 2014 and capitalized as an intangible asset, was determined to
be $101, based on the present value of the minimum guaranteed royalty payable to DIL using a discount rate of 10%. The intangible
asset is being amortized over an estimated useful life of ten (10) years. The remaining contingent royalty payments will be recorded
as the contingency is resolved and the royalty becomes payable under the arrangement. For additional information on the supply
agreement with DIL refer to  NOTE 12   Commitments and Contingencies - Supply Agreement.   

Intangible
assets also include patent costs associated with applying for a patent and being issued a patent. Costs to defend a patent and
costs to invalidate a competitor s patent or patent application are expensed as incurred. Upon issuance of the patent, capitalized
patent costs are reclassified from intangibles with indefinite lives to intangibles with finite lives and amortized on a straight-line
basis over the shorter of the estimated economic life or the initial term of the patent, generally 20 years. During the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $0 and $44, respectively. The impairment
loss was related to the write-off of capitalized patent costs due to the unlikelihood of certain patents being issued.  

Intangible
assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:  

Assuming
no additions, disposals or adjustments are made to the carrying values and/or useful lives of the intangible assets, annual amortization
expense for intangible assets is estimated to be $53 over the remainder of 2016 and $210 in each of the next five years.  

Impairment
testing of intangible assets subject to amortization involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted
future cash flows whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.
In the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is considered not
recoverable and an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its
fair value, calculated using a discounted future cash flow method. The computed impairment loss is recognized in the period that
the impairment occurs. Assets which are not impaired may require an adjustment to the remaining useful lives for which to amortize
the asset. Impairment testing requires the development of significant estimates and assumptions involving the determination of
estimated net cash flows, selection of the appropriate discount rate to measure the risk inherent in future cash flow streams,
assessment of an asset s life cycle, competitive trends impacting the asset as well as other factors. Changes in these underlying
assumptions could significantly impact the asset s estimated fair value.  

Revenue
Recognition   

  The
Company records revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has been shipped or delivered,
the sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Product sales represent revenue
from the sale of products and related shipping amounts billed to customers, net of promotional discounts, rebates, and return
allowances. Depending on individual customer agreements, sales are recognized either upon shipment of product to customers or
upon delivery. With respect to direct-to-consumer sales, both title and risk of loss transfer to customers upon our delivery to
the customer. The Company s gross product sales may be subject to sales allowances and deductions in arriving at reported
net product sales. For example, we may periodically offer discounts and sales incentives to customers to encourage purchases.
Sales incentives are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction. Reductions from gross sales for
customer discounts and rebates have been minimal. Sales allowances for product returns have not been provided, since under our
existing arrangements, distributors are not permitted to return product except for non-conforming product.

Advertising   

  The
Company charges the costs of advertising to selling, general and administrative expenses as incurred. Advertising and promotional
costs were $53 and $49 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $171 and $246 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively. Advertising and promotional costs consisted primarily of marketing costs for our
R  Muscle Health products.  

Research
and Development   

  Research
and development expenses consist primarily of salaries, benefits, and other related costs, including stock-based compensation,
for personnel serving in our research and development functions, and other internal operating expenses, the cost of manufacturing
our product for clinical study, the cost of conducting clinical studies and the cost of conducting preclinical and research activities.
Nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities
are initially capitalized and are then recognized as an expense as the related goods are consumed or the services are performed.  

Shipping
and Handling Costs   

  The
Company records costs of shipping and handling of product to our customers in cost of sales. These expenses were $4 and $4 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $18 and $8 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively.  

Stock-based
Compensation   

 Generally, stock-based payments are measured at their
estimated fair value on the date of grant. Stock-based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the estimated
number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. For stock options and restricted stock that do not vest immediately but
which contain only a service vesting feature, we recognize compensation cost on the unvested shares and options on a straight-line
basis over the remaining vesting period. 

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and the market price of our common stock
on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock issued. Our determination of fair value of stock-based awards is affected
by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include,
but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and certain other market variables such
as the risk-free interest rate.  

Segment
Information   

  Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) 280,  Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information , establishes
standards for reporting information about operating segments and requires selected information for those segments to be presented
in the financial statements. It also establishes standards for related disclosures about products and services and geographic
areas. Operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise about which separate discrete financial information is
available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in making decisions how to allocate
resources and assess performance. Management has determined that the Company operates in one segment.

Fair
Value Measurement   

Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction
between market participants. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring
fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby observable and unobservable inputs, used in valuation techniques,
are assigned a hierarchical level.     A financial asset or liability s
classification is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. At September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s financial instruments consist primarily of cash, accounts receivable, accounts
payable and accrued expenses and short-term debt. Due to their short-term nature, the carrying amounts of the Company s
financial instruments approximated their fair values.  

Basic
and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Share         

 Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by
dividing net loss available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during
the period. Potential dilutive securities outstanding are not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share, because
including potential dilutive securities outstanding in the denominator of a diluted per-share computation would result in an anti-dilutive
per share amount when an entity has a net loss for the period. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
the Company incurred a net loss. Accordingly, the Company s common stock equivalents were anti-dilutive and excluded from
the diluted net loss per share computation. The aggregate number of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding at
September 30, 2016 excluded from the diluted net loss per share computation because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were
1,681,658, which includes warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,136,878 shares of common stock, options to purchase an aggregate
of 301,090 shares of common stock, 222,290 shares of common stock issuable upon the conversion of a convertible promissory note
and accrued interest thereon (See NOTE 6   Debt   Convertible Note) and unvested restricted stock awards of 21,400
shares of common stock. The aggregate number of potentially dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding at September 30, 2016
excluded from the diluted net loss per share computation because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive were 1,216,808, which includes
warrants to purchase an aggregate of 761,878 shares of common stock, options to purchase an aggregate of 443,480 shares of common
stock and unvested restricted stock awards of 11,450 shares of common stock. 

Income
Taxes   

  Income
taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,  Accounting for Income Taxes 
( ASC 740 ). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences
between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as operating
loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the periods in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred
tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that the recoverability of the asset is unlikely to be recognized.  

The
Company follows ASC 740 rules governing uncertain tax positions, which provides guidance for recognition and measurement. This
prescribes a threshold condition that a tax position must meet for any of the benefits of the uncertain tax position to be recognized
in the financial statements. It also provides accounting guidance on recognition, classification and disclosure of these uncertain
tax positions. The Company has no uncertain income tax positions.  

Interest
costs and penalties related to income taxes are classified as interest expense and operating expenses, respectively, in the Company's
financial statements.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not recognize
any interest or penalty expense related to income taxes.  The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction
and states in which it does business.

NOTE
3   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   

From
time to time, new accounting guidance is issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other standard
setting bodies that is adopted by the Company as of the effective date or, in some cases where early adoption is permitted, in
advance of the effective date. The Company has assessed the recently issued guidance that is not yet effective and, unless otherwise
indicated below, believes the new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash
flows or financial position.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU ) No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation
(Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 provides guidance
designed to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including guidance relating to accounting
for income taxes with respect to share-based payment awards; providing generally that excess tax benefits related to share-based
awards should be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense (currently, excess tax benefits generally are recorded to additional-paid-in-capital);
providing generally that excess tax benefits related to share-based awards should be classified along with other income tax cash
flows as an operating activity (currently, excess tax benefits generally are separated from other income tax cash flows and classified
as a financing activity); providing that an entity may make an accounting policy election either to base compensation cost accruals
on the number of awards expected to vest (as required by current guidance) or to account for forfeitures when they occur; modifying
the current exception to liability classification such that partial cash settlement of an award for tax withholding purposes would
not result, by itself, in liability classification of the award if the amount withheld does not exceed the maximum statutory tax
rate in the employees' applicable jurisdictions (currently, an award cannot qualify for equity classification, rather than liability
classification, if the amount withheld exceeds the minimum statutory withholding requirements); and providing that cash paid by
an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity on the
statement of cash flows (currently there is no authoritative guidance addressing this classification issue). The guidance is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted
(if early adoption occurs in an interim period, any adjustments will be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that
includes the interim period). Depending on the particular issue addressed by the guidance, application of the guidance will be
made prospectively, retrospectively or subject to a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the potential
impact of adopting this guidance on the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) Section A   Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting
Standard Codification ( ASU 2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 provides guidance that will change the requirements for accounting
for leases. The principal change under the new accounting guidance is that lessees under leases classified as operating leases
will recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. Current lease accounting does not require lessees to recognize assets
and liabilities arising under operating leases on the balance sheet. Under the new guidance, lessees (including lessees under
leases classified as finance leases and operating leases) will recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease liability on the balance
sheet, initially measured as the present value of lease payments under the lease. Expense recognition and cash flow presentation
guidance will be based upon whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a finance lease (the classification criteria
for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases is substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing
between capital leases and operating leases under current guidance). The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using
a modified retrospective transition approach for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning
of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements; the guidance provides certain practical expedients.
The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine its impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows
and financial position.

   (Unaudited;
amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts, unless otherwise indicated)   

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU
2015-17 ). ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement
of financial position. The amendments in this Update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets
or retrospectively to all periods presented and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating
the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory
(Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11 ) which changes the measurement principle for inventory
from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated
selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early
adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements
and related disclosures. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying
the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ), which requires all debt issuance costs be presented
in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt. Prior to the issuance of this standard,
debt issuance costs, which are specific incremental costs, other than those paid to the lender, that are directly attributable
to issuing a debt instrument (i.e., third party costs), were required to be presented in the balance sheet as a deferred charge
(i.e., an asset). Under ASU 2015-03, the presentation of debt issuance costs is consistent with the presentation for a debt discount,
(i.e., a direct adjustment to the carrying value of the debt). ASU 2015-03 does not affect the recognition and measurement of debt
issuance costs. Accordingly, the amortization of such costs should continue to be calculated using the interest method and be reported
as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 is effective for us in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company believes the new guidance will not have a material impact on the
Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The adoption of this standard as of January 1, 2016, did
not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01,  Income
Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)   Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating
the Concept of Extraordinary Items,  ( ASU 2015-01 ). ASU 2015-01 eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary
items and, therefore, it will no longer be necessary for entities to assess items for potential classification as extraordinary
items in their financial statements. The accounting changes in ASU 2015-01 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted provided that the standard is applied
from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of this standard as of January 1, 2016, did not have any impact
on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation
of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to
Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). The amendments in this standard define management s responsibility
to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and provides
related footnote disclosure requirements. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared under the presumption that the reporting
organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances. Financial reporting under this presumption
is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis of accounting establishes the fundamental
basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. This standard provides guidance on when there is substantial doubt
about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and how the underlying conditions and events should be disclosed
in the footnotes. It is intended to reduce diversity that existed in footnote disclosures because of the lack of guidance about
when substantial doubt existed. The amendments in this standard are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2017. Early
application is permitted. The Company believes the new standard will not have a material impact on the Company s results
of operations, cash flows or financial position. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition
guidance under U.S. GAAP and requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in
an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. Additionally, qualitative
and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes in judgments, and assets
recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This accounting guidance is effective for us beginning in the first
quarter of 2018 using one of two prescribed transition methods. The Company believes the new standard will not have a material
impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

Operating
Lease   

  The
Company leases its corporate offices under an operating lease. The term of the lease is five years commencing on January 1, 2015
and expiring on December 31, 2019. We have two options to renew our lease for an additional three years each.  

At
September 30, 2016, the future minimum lease payments under the non-cancellable operating lease in excess of one year is as follows:  

Rent
expense, including common area maintenance charges and taxes, was $55 and $61 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, and $155 and $172 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Defined
Contribution Plan   

  The
Company established a 401(k) Plan (the  401(k) Plan ) for eligible employees of the Company effective April 1, 2014.
Generally, all employees of the Company who are at least twenty-one years of age and who have completed three months of service
are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan. The 401(k) Plan is a defined contribution plan that provides that participants
may make salary deferral contributions, of up to the statutory maximum allowed by law (subject to make-up contributions) in the
form of voluntary payroll deductions. The Company s matching contribution is equal to 100 percent on the first four percent
of a participant s compensation which is deferred as an elective deferral. The Company s aggregate matching contribution
were $5 and $10 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $21 and $37 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Supply
Agreement   

On July 18, 2014, the Company
entered into the First Amended and Restated Exclusive Supply Agreement (the  Supply Agreement ) with DIL. Pursuant
to the Supply Agreement , DIL manufactures and supplies Fortetropin exclusively to the Company
and may not manufacture Fortetropin for other entities. In exchange, the Company agreed to purchase minimum quantities of Fortetropin at
fixed prices through 2016. DIL agreed to assign its United States patent application for the manufacture of the formula to the
Company and the Company agreed, for a period of seven years from the expiration of the  Supply 
Agreement, to pay DIL a low single-digit royalty payment for each kilogram of Fortetropin produced by the Company, subject
to certain minimum and maximum amounts. DIL also granted the Company a right of first refusal to license and/or acquire the European
patent it owns for the manufacture of the formula. The  Supply  Agreement expires on
December 31, 2016, and may be renewed for additional one-year periods unless terminated by either party by giving a ninety day
notice before the expiration of the current term . 

The minimum purchase obligations
under the Supply Agreement are  3,685, or approximately $4,131, in 2016 including, respectively, 2014, 2015 and first nine
months 2016 purchase commitments of  229, or approximately $257,  1,728, or approximately $1,937, and  1,296, or
approximately $1,453 that were not yet made and  432, or approximately $484, for the remaining three months of 2016. Our
failure to meet the 2016 minimum purchase commitment could be considered a material breach under the terms of the Supply Agreement,
and DIL can seek to hold the Company in material breach. This would require DIL to provide written notice of such breach, and
the Company would have sixty days to fulfill the minimum purchase commitment. If we do not cure the breach within sixty days,
DIL may terminate the Supply Agreement immediately upon sending us written notification. If the Supply Agreement is terminated,
DIL may attempt to invalidate the related U.S. patent owned by the Company, which could cause us to incur significant expenses
to defend against such claim. If DIL is successful in invalidating the U.S. patent, we may be limited from manufacturing, selling
or using Fortetropin, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Legal
Proceedings   

On October 27, 2016, Cutler Holdings, L.L.C.
( Cutler ) filed a complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey alleging that the Company failed to make certain rental
payments that are in dispute in the amount of $257,000, of which $208,000 has been accrued for as of September 30, 2016. The complaint
also seeks compensatory and other damages in an unspecified amount. The Company is currently in discussions with Cutler to resolve
the complaint. 

To the knowledge of our management, except
as described above, there is no litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers or directors in their
capacity as such or against any of our property.

Overview   

We
were incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 11, 2007. On March 17, 2016, we merged with our wholly-owned subsidiary and
changed our name from MYOS Corporation to MYOS RENS Technology Inc. Prior to February 2011, we did not have any operations and
did not generate any revenues. In February 2011, we acquired our proprietary active ingredient called Fortetropin   ,
the first clinically proven natural myostatin reducing agent. Since February 2011, our principal business activities have been
focused on deepening our scientific understanding of the activity of Fortetropin, and to leverage this knowledge to strengthen
and build our intellectual property; developing sales and marketing strategies aimed at expanding our commercial presence; evaluating
the value of Fortetropin in therapeutic markets, including the treatment of sarcopenia, cachexia, anorexia, obesity and muscular-related
conditions; and, conducting research and development focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of other products
and technologies aimed at maintaining or improving the health and performance of muscle tissue.  

Plan
of Operation   

We
are focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of nutritional supplements, functional foods, therapeutic products
and other technologies aimed at maintaining or improving the health and performance of muscle tissue. Our initial core ingredient
is Fortetropin, a natural, reversible, temporary myostatin reducing agent. Our plan of action is to: (i) create a sales platform
through marketing products containing our proprietary ingredient Fortetropin in established, growing, and new markets and strategic
selection of partnerships and collaborations to maximize near-term and future revenues, (ii) deepen the scientific understanding
of the activity of Fortetropin, specifically as a natural, reversible, temporary reducer of the regulatory protein myostatin,
and to leverage this knowledge to strengthen and build our intellectual property, (iii) conduct research and development activities
to evaluate myostatin modulation in a range of both wellness and disease states, (iv) identify other products and technologies
which may broaden our portfolio and define a business development strategy to protect, enhance and accelerate the growth of our
products, (v) reduce the cost of manufacturing through process improvement, and (vi) identify contract manufacturing resources
that can fully meet our future growth requirements. We believe that myostatin regulation represents a rational entry point for
our drug discovery efforts and are evaluating therapeutic targets in this area.  

In February 2014, we expanded our commercial
operations into the age management market through a distribution agreement with Cenegenics Product and Lab Services, LLC ( Cenegenics ),
under which Cenegenics distributes a proprietary formulation containing Fortetropin which it previously purchased from the Company
through its age management centers and its community of physicians focused on treating a growing population of patients focused
on proactively addressing age-related health and wellness concerns. On November 28, 2014, we entered into a settlement agreement
with Cenegenics wherein we agreed to accept $1,900 by April 2016 in full satisfaction of Cenegenics  outstanding obligations
with respect to units of product produced by the Company, including units that had not yet been shipped to Cenegenics at the time
of the settlement agreement. During the second quarter of 2015, Cenegenics accepted delivery of the remaining units that we were
storing on its behalf. Given the settlement agreement s extended payment schedule, the Company deferred the revenue and
related cost associated with the shipment and recorded the revenue and cost of sales as the payments were received in full through
April 2016. The distribution agreement with Cenegenics expires in December 2016. 

22  

During
the second quarter of 2015 we launched R  Muscle Health TM , our own direct-to-consumer portfolio of muscle health
bars, meal replacement shakes and daily supplement powders each powered by a full 6.6 gram single serving dose of Fortetropin.
Our R  Muscle Health products are sold through our e-commerce website, remusclehealth.com, and amazon.com. 

We have taken significant
steps towards a strategic rebrand and a messaging overhaul and expect to launch a newly named and packaged product line in early
2017. Our branding overhaul will focus on utilizing a new stratified brand family to target newly trending demographics differently
across multiple online and traditional sales channels. We continue to pursue additional distribution and branded sales opportunities. 

We expect to continue developing
our own core branded products in markets such as functional foods, sports and fitness nutrition and rehab and restorative health
and to pursue international sales opportunities. We believe the growing awareness of the potential therapeutic uses of myostatin
reducing agents supports continued development of our own core products. We remain committed to developing new products, improving
our existing products and reducing the cost of manufacturing our products by finding more efficient manufacturing processes and
contract manufacturers. 

There can be no assurance
that we will be able to secure distribution arrangements on terms acceptable to the Company, or that we will be able to generate
significant sales of our current and future branded products. 

The
Company currently relies on one third-party manufacturer to produce Fortetropin. This manufacturer purchases all the necessary
raw materials from suppliers and coordinates any additional production steps with third-parties. We have multiple vendors for
blending, packaging and labeling our finished products. 

Strategic
Investment Transaction   

On December 17, 2015, the Company
entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with RENS Technology Inc. (the  Purchaser ),
pursuant to which the Purchaser agreed to invest $20.25 million in the Company (the  Financing ) in exchange for (i)
an aggregate of 3,537,037 shares (the  Shares ) of the Company s common stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Common
Stock ), and (ii) warrants to purchase an aggregate of 884,259 shares of Common Stock (the  Warrants , and together
with the Shares, the  Securities ). The Purchaser agreed to purchase the Securities in three tranches over twenty-four
months. In the first tranche, which closed on March 3, 2016, the Purchaser acquired 1,500,000 Shares and a warrant to purchase
375,000 shares of Common Stock (the  First Closing Warrant ) for $5.25 million. In the second tranche, which we had
expected to close in September 2016, the Purchaser would have acquired 925,926 Shares and a warrant to purchase 231,481 shares
of Common Stock (the  Second Closing Warrant ) for $5.0 million. In the third tranche, which we had expected would
close within eighteen months of the closing of the second tranche, the Purchaser would have acquired 1,111,111 Shares and a warrant
to purchase 277,778 shares of Common Stock (the  Third Closing Warrant ) for $10.0 million. Each of the Warrants would
be immediately exercisable upon issuance, would expire five years after issuance and would have the following exercise prices:
(a) $7.00 per share for the First Closing Warrant, (b) $10.80 per share for the Second Closing Warrant and (c) $18.00 per share
for the Third Closing Warrant. In addition, the Company agreed: (i) that the Purchaser would have the right to appoint four persons
to the Company s board of directors, subject to adjustment based on the Purchaser s ownership percentage of the Company;
(ii) to provide the Purchaser with a right to participate in 50% (or 100% if shares are to be issued for less than $3.50 per share)
of any future financings pursued by the Company within 12 months from the closing of the third tranche of the Financing; and, (iii)
until the closing of the third tranche, the Company would not take certain actions, including issuing shares (except for certain
permitted issuances) or appointing new officers and directors, without the Purchaser s consent (collectively the  Purchaser s
Rights ). 

On August 19, 2016, the Purchaser
notified the Company that it did not intend to fulfill its obligation to fund the second tranche of the Financing, notwithstanding
its confirmation to the Company in June 2016 that the Purchaser would provide such funding in accordance with the terms of the
Purchase Agreement. 

The Company has had subsequent discussions
with the Purchaser regarding its breach of the terms of the Purchase Agreement and is reviewing all of its options, including legal
options, against the Purchaser for its breach of the terms of the Purchase Agreement. 

The Purchase Agreement provides
that in the event that the Purchaser notifies the Company that it does not intend to fund the Second Closing Subscription Amount,
the Purchaser is required to take all requisite action to cause the resignation or removal of one of its designees on the Board
of Directors of the Company. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, effective August 23, 2016, Guiying Zhao resigned
as a director of the Company. In addition, the Purchaser s Rights terminated, effective August 19, 2016. 

Clinical
and Basic Research Programs   

We
invest in research and development activities externally through academic and industry collaborations aimed at enhancing our products,
optimizing manufacturing and broadening the product portfolio. We have developed the following collaborations with various academic
centers:  

In
                                         May 2015, we initiated a dose response clinical study led by Jacob Wilson, Ph.D., CSCS*D,
                                         Professor of Health Sciences and Human performance at the University of Tampa, to examine
                                         the effects of Fortetropin supplementation on plasma myostatin levels at various dosing
                                         levels in young adult males and females. This study is intended to help us better define
                                         the dose response curve, the minimal effective dose and effects of Fortetropin on serum
                                         myostatin. In this double blind placebo controlled clinical study, 80 male and female
                                         subjects ranging in ages between 18 and 22 were randomized into four groups such that
                                         no significant differences in serum myostatin concentration existed between groups. Following
                                         assignment to one of the four groups, blood samples were collected to establish baseline
                                         values. Subjects were subsequently supplemented with three different doses of Fortetropin
                                         (2.0g, 4.0g and 6.6g) and a matching placebo for one week. Following a week of supplementation,
                                         blood samples were collected and serum myostatin levels were assayed. Results demonstrated
                                         that Fortetropin is effective as a myostatin reducing agent at daily doses of 4.0g and
                                         6.6g. This research, which continues to build upon our current knowledge of Fortetropin,
                                         may result in the formulation of new products. Data from this study was presented at
                                         the 2016 International Conference on Frailty   Sarcopenia in April 2016.     

23  

In
                                         May 2014, we entered into an agreement with the University of Tampa to study the effects
                                         of Fortetropin supplementation in conjunction with modest resistance training in average
                                         men. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which examined the effects
                                         of Fortetropin on skeletal muscle growth, lean body mass, strength, and power in recreationally
                                         trained males. Forty-five subjects were divided into placebo, 6.6g and 19.8g dosing arms
                                         of Fortetropin daily for a period of 12 weeks. Results demonstrated a statistically significant
                                         increase in both muscle thickness and lean body mass in subjects taking Fortetropin compared
                                         to placebo. Additionally, a statistically significant decrease in fat mass in subjects
                                         in the 19.8g arm was noted. The clinical study also analyzed blood myostatin, follistatin
                                         and cytokines levels via high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA )
                                         based spectrophotometric. Serum was analyzed for a plethora of relative cytokine levels
                                         via high-sensitivity enhanced chemiluminescent-based methods. The Interferon-Gamma ( IFN-  )
                                         inflammatory cytokine protocol screening showed no statistically significant changes
                                         in serum levels of IFN-  for subjects in the placebo group. However, subjects in
                                         both Fortetropin daily dosing arms experienced statistically significant decreases (p
                                           0.05) in serum levels of the IFN-  inflammatory cytokine. IFN-  is recognized
                                         as a signature pro-inflammatory cytokine protein that plays a central role in inflammation
                                         and autoimmune diseases. Excess levels of inflammatory cytokines are associated with
                                         muscle-wasting diseases such as sarcopenia and cachexia. The lipid serum safety protocol
                                         demonstrated that daily use of Fortetropin at recommended and three times the recommended
                                         dose had no adverse lipid effect and did not adversely affect cholesterol, HDL or triglyceride
                                         levels. Data from the study was presented at the American College of Nutrition s
                                         55 th  annual conference. A separate mechanism of action study at the University
                                         of Tampa demonstrated that in addition to reducing serum myostatin levels, Fortetropin
                                         showed activity in mTOR and Ubiquitin pathways, two other crucial signaling pathways
                                         in the growth and maintenance of healthy muscle. Specifically, the preclinical data showed
                                         that Fortetropin up-regulates the mTOR regulatory pathway. The mTOR pathway is responsible
                                         for production of a protein kinase related to cell growth and proliferation that increases
                                         skeletal muscle mass. Up-regulation of the mTOR pathway is important in preventing muscle
                                         atrophy. We believe Fortetropin's ability to affect the mTOR pathway may have a significant
                                         impact in treating patients suffering from degenerative muscle diseases and suggests
                                         that Fortetropin-based products may help slow muscle loss secondary to immobility and
                                         denervation. The preclinical data also demonstrated that Fortetropin acts to reduce the
                                         synthesis of proteins in the Ubiquitin pathway, a highly selective, tightly regulated
                                         system that serves to activate muscle breakdown. Over-production in the Ubiquitin pathway
                                         is responsible for muscle degradation. We believe Fortetropin's ability to regulate production
                                         in the Ubiquitin pathway may have significant implications for repairing age-related
                                         muscle loss and for patients suffering from chronic diseases causing cachexia. The study
                                         was published in June 2016 in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition.    

The
foregoing agreements are an integral part of our business strategy and we believe they will provide a clear scientific rationale
for Fortetropin's role as a nutritional product and support its use in different medical and health applications in the future.

Results
of Operations   

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three months ended September 30, 2015    

Net
sales   

Net
sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $3, or 8%, compared to net sales for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily due to a shift in commercial strategy -  from
exclusive distribution relationships to e-commerce sales of our  R  Muscle Health portfolio of branded products, which
we began selling during t he second quarter of 2015.  We continue to explore strategic
partnerships and collaborations opportunities to expand the commercial distribution of Fortetropin and our R  Muscle Health
portfolio of products.  

Cost
of sales   

Cost
of sales for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $366, or 92%, compared to cost of sales for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to inventory write offs of $371 in 2015 compared to
$94 in 2016.  

Gross
profit (loss)  

Gross
profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $9, an increase of 102% compared to gross loss of $360 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to inventory write offs of $371 in 2015 compared to $94 in 2016.   

Operating
expenses   

Research
and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $123, or 53%, compared to research and development
expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in research and development expenses was due primarily to
a decrease of $80 in personnel costs and a decrease of $31 in clinical study costs.  

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $58, or 9%, compared to selling, general
and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses was due primarily to a $98 reversal of prior year expense related to the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts
recorded against the Cenegenics  accounts receivable recognized in 2015 that did not recur, an increase of $76 in marketing
and promotion expenses; partially offset by a decrease in personnel costs of $168 consisting mostly of stock-based compensation.  

Other
(expense), net   

Other
(expense), net for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $7, or 190%, compared to other (expense), net for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other (expense), net was due to $12 of interest expense related to the convertible
note during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $5 of interest expense during the three months ended September
30, 2015 related to the October 2013 revolving credit agreement (as amended, the  Revolving Note ).

Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine months ended September 30, 2015    

Net
sales   

Net
sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $176, or 142%, compared to net sales for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in net sales was primarily due to an increase in sales revenue related to the collections of deferred revenue
from a distributor of $150 and an increase in direct sales of $88 partially offset by a decrease of $57 related to another distributor .
 We continue to explore strategic partnerships and collaborations opportunities to expand the commercial distribution of
Fortetropin and our R  Muscle Health portfolio of products.  

Cost
of sales   

Cost
of sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $140, or 32%, compared to cost of sales for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to inventory write offs of $276 in 2015 that did not recur
in 2016 partially offset by lower margins related to e-commerce sales.  

Gross
profit (loss)   

Gross
profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $8, an increase of 103% compared to gross loss of $308 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to net increase in sales of $176 offset by inventory write offs in 2015.   

Operating
expenses   

Research
and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $153, or 24%, compared to research and
development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in research and development expenses was
primarily due to a $152 decrease in personnel costs associated with our clinical and basic research programs and a decrease
in clinical study costs.   

Selling,
general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $213, or 8%, compared to selling, general
and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in selling, general and administrative
expenses was primarily due to a $269 increase in investor and public relations costs, and a $293 reversal of prior year expense
related to the reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts recorded against the Cenegenics  accounts receivable that
did not recur in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in personnel costs of $389 consisting mostly of stock-based
compensation and a $94 decrease in professional and consulting fees.

Other
(expense), net   

Other
(expense), net for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $24, or 240%, compared to other (expense), net for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in other (expense), net was due to $35 of interest expense related to the convertible
note during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $11 of interest expense during the nine months ended September
30, 2015 related to the revolving note.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Working
capital at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 is summarized as follows:  

Working
capital increased $2,066 to $3,621 at September 30, 2016 compared to $1,555 at December 31, 2015. Changes in working capital components
were as follows:  

Cash
                                         increased $2,010 primarily due to net proceeds of $5,141 received from the first tranche
                                         of the Financing. (See Note 1 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in Item
                                         1. of this Quarterly Report) partially offset by the cash used in operations of $3,031
                                         during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     

Accounts
                                         receivable, net decreased $405 primarily due to a decrease of $400 of accounts receivable
                                         from Cenegenics, consisting of $322 of payments received under the Cenegenics settlement
                                         agreement and $78 resulting from expected product returns.    

Inventories,
                                         net increased $386 primarily due to inventory purchases of $467, which was partially
                                         offset by deferred charges of $153 related to the cost of inventory previously shipped
                                         to Cenegenics (of which $101 was recognized in cost of sales upon receipt of payment
                                         of the commensurate sale during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $52 was
                                         written-off as unrecoverable costs related to the return of non-conforming goods) that
                                         was deferred until payment of the commensurate sale was received.    

Prepaid
                                         expenses and other current assets decreased $461 primarily due to a decrease in prepaid
                                         inventory of $250, higher prepaid insurance of $49, partially offset by a decrease in
                                         deferred charges of $153 related to cost of inventory previously shipped to Cenegenics
                                         (refer to the above discussion on inventories, net) and $65 related to deferred financing
                                         costs being reclassified to additional paid-in capital upon the closing of the first
                                         tranche of the Financing.     

27  

Accounts
                                         payable decreased $79 primarily due to the timing of payments.    

Accrued
                                         expenses decreased $357 primarily due to a $228 decrease in deferred revenue related
                                         to product shipped to Cenegenics (of which $150 was recognized during the nine months
                                         ended September 30, 2016 upon receipt of payment from the customer and $78 was written
                                         off as unrecoverable costs related to product returns for non-conforming goods). In addition,
                                         accrued salaries decreased by $151 due to the payout of accrued personnel expenses.     

At
September 30, 2016, we had cash of $2,889 and total assets of $6,630 (which includes intangible assets of $1,579).  

As of the filing date of this Form
10-Q, the Company s management believes that there is not sufficient capital resources from operations and existing financing
arrangements in order to meet operating expenses for the next twelve months. The Company will need to seek additional funding through
public or private financing or through collaborative arrangements with strategic partners as the Company expects that it will continue
to incur losses for the immediate future. The Company s management believes the Company s ability to finance future
cash needs from its operations depends on its ability to sustain and grow revenue of the new strategic rebranding as well as the
Company s ability to access capital markets when necessary to accomplish the Company s strategic objectives. However,
there can be no guarantee that the Company will be successful in these efforts, or if they are, that such efforts will be adequate
to meet the Company s short-term capital requirements. These facts raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability
to continue as a going concern. 

Summarized
cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:  

Cash flows from operating activities
represent net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash used by operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $1,060 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily
due to higher operating expenses and lower working capital, partially offset by lower gross profit. 

There was no cash used in investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 included additions to fixed assets of $27. 

Net
cash provided by financing activities includes proceeds from borrowing and issuing equity instruments. Net cash provided by financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes net proceeds of $5,141 from the closing of the first tranche
of the Financing, offset by $100 used to pay off the term note on January 7, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 includes net proceeds of $916 received from the cash exercise of the Series D warrants
and net borrowing of $300 made under the Term Note (as defined below).  

Convertible
Note   

On
December 17, 2015, concurrent with the execution of the Purchase Agreement with RENS Technology Inc., the Company issued an unsecured
promissory note in the principal amount of $575 (the  Note ) to Gan Ren, a related party of RENS Agriculture. The
Note bears interest at a rate of 8% per annum and matures on December 17, 2016 (the  Maturity Date ) and had accrued
interest of $36 at September 30, 2016. On the Maturity Date, the Note and any accrued interest thereon will automatically convert
into shares of Common Stock at $2.75 per share (the  Conversion Price ), unless earlier converted. At any time prior
to the Maturity Date, the holder of the Note may convert in whole or in part the Note and any accrued interest into shares of
Common Stock at the Conversion Price. Subject to conversion terms, the Note may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time by
the Company prior to the Maturity Date, without penalty. In the event of a prepayment, the holder will have the right to convert
the unpaid principal and accrued interest owing under the Note, in whole or in part, into shares Common Stock at the Conversion
Price. The Note includes standard events of default including non-payment of the principal or accrued interest due on the Note.
Upon an event of default, all obligations under the Note will become due and payable.  

Term
Note   

On
September 10, 2015, the Company converted its outstanding revolving note with City National Bank, which had a termination date
of August 31, 2015, into a term note (the  Term Note ). The Term Note provided that the then outstanding balance of
$400 shall be payable along with interest thereon on the last day of each month in four (4) consecutive installments of $100,
with the final installment due and payable in full on December 31, 2015. The Term Note was collateralized by all inventory, chattel
paper, accounts, equipment, general intangibles, securities and instruments and contained customary events of default, including
failure to make payment and bankruptcy. At September 30, 2016 there were no borrowings under the Term Note. At December 31, 2015,
the balance under the Term Note was $100. The Term Note was paid in full on January 7, 2016.

Long-term
Contractual Obligations   

At
September 30, 2016, the Company s enforceable and legally binding contractual obligations include future minimum lease payments
under a non-cancellable operating lease and purchase obligations under a long-term supply agreement.  

At
September 30, 2016, the future minimum lease payments under the non-cancellable operating lease in excess of one year were as
follows:  

For
additional information about the operating lease refer to  NOTE 12   Commitments and Contingencies   Operating
Lease  in our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements.  

See
the discussion in  Convertible Note  above for a description of such contractual obligation.  

On July 18, 2014, the Company
entered into the First Amended and Restated Exclusive Supply Agreement (the  Supply Agreement ) with DIL. Pursuant
to the Supply Agreement , DIL manufactures and supplies Fortetropin exclusively to the Company
and may not manufacture Fortetropin for other entities. In exchange, the Company agreed to purchase minimum quantities of Fortetropin at
fixed prices through 2016. DIL agreed to assign its United States patent application for the manufacture of the formula to the
Company and the Company agreed, for a period of seven years from the expiration of the  Supply 
Agreement, to pay DIL a low single-digit royalty payment for each kilogram of Fortetropin produced by the Company, subject
to certain minimum and maximum amounts. DIL also granted the Company a right of first refusal to license and/or acquire the European
patent it owns for the manufacture of the formula. The  Supply  Agreement expires on
December 31, 2016, and may be renewed for additional one-year periods unless terminated by either party by giving a ninety day
notice before the expiration of the current term . 

The minimum purchase obligations
under the Supply Agreement are  3,685, or approximately $4,131, in 2016 including, respectively, 2014, 2015 and first nine
months 2016 purchase commitments of  229, or approximately $257,  1,728, or approximately $1,937, and  1,296, or
approximately $1,453 that were not yet made and  432, or approximately $484, for the remaining three months of 2016. Our
failure to meet the 2016 minimum purchase commitment could be considered a material breach under the terms of the Supply Agreement,
and DIL can seek to hold the Company in material breach. This would require DIL to provide written notice of such breach, and
the Company would have sixty days to fulfill the minimum purchase commitment. If we do not cure the breach within sixty days,
DIL may terminate the Supply Agreement immediately upon sending us written notification. If the Supply Agreement is terminated,
DIL may attempt to invalidate the related U.S. patent owned by the Company, which could cause us to incur significant expenses
to defend against such claim. If DIL is successful in invalidating the U.S. patent, we may be limited from manufacturing, selling
or using Fortetropin, which would adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standard Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee share-Based Payment Accounting (ASU
2016-09 ). ASU 216-09 provides guidance designed to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including guidance relating to accounting for income taxes with respect to share-based payment awards; providing generally that
excess tax benefits related to share-based awards should be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense (currently, excess tax
benefits generally are recorded to additional-paid-in-capital); providing generally that excess tax benefits related to share-based
awards should be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity (currently, excess tax benefits generally
are separated from other income tax cash flows and classified as a financing activity); providing that an entity may make an accounting
policy election either to base compensation cost accruals on the number of awards expected to vest (as required by current guidance)
or to account for forfeitures when they occur; modifying the current exception to liability classification such that partial cash
settlement of an award for tax withholding purposes would not result, by itself, in liability classification of the award if the
amount withheld does not exceed the maximum statutory tax rate in the employees' applicable jurisdictions (currently, an award
cannot qualify for equity classification, rather than liability classification, if the amount withheld exceeds the minimum statutory
withholding requirements); and providing that cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes
should be classified as a financing activity on the statement of cash flows (currently there is no authoritative guidance addressing
this classification issue). The guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted (if early adoption occurs in an interim period, any adjustments will be reflected
as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period). Depending on the particular issue addressed by the guidance,
application of the guidance will be made prospectively, retrospectively or subject to a retrospective transition method. We are
currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting this guidance on the Company's results of operations, cash flows and financial
position.  

In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) Section A   Leases: Amendments to the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASU
2016-02 ). ASU 2016-02 provides guidance that will change the requirements for accounting for leases. The principal change
under the new accounting guidance is that lessees under leases classified as operating leases will recognize a right-of-use asset
and a lease liability. Current lease accounting does not require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities arising under operating
leases on the balance sheet. Under the new guidance, lessees (including lessees under leases classified as finance leases and operating
leases) will recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet, initially measured as the present value
of lease payments under the lease. Expense recognition and cash flow presentation guidance will be based upon whether the lease
is classified as an operating lease or a finance lease (the classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and
operating leases is substantially similar to the classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating
leases under current guidance). The standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning
after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The new standard must be adopted using a modified retrospective transition
approach for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period
presented in the financial statements; the guidance provides certain practical expedients. The Company is currently evaluating
this guidance to determine its impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows and financial position. 

In November 2015, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes ( ASU 2015-17 ) ASU
2015-17requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position.
The amendments in this Update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively
to all periods presented and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the effect
that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

In
July 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory ( ASU 2015-11 )
which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable
value. ASU 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably
predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is
effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect
that the updated standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  

In April 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  ( ASU 2015-03 ), which requires
all debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying value of the associated debt.
Prior to the issuance of this standard, debt issuance costs, which are specific incremental costs, other than those paid to the
lender, that are directly attributable to issuing a debt instrument (i.e., third party costs), were required to be presented in
the balance sheet as a deferred charge (i.e., an asset). Under ASU 2015-03, the presentation of debt issuance costs is consistent
with the presentation for a debt discount, (i.e., a direct adjustment to the carrying value of the debt). ASU 2015-03 does not
affect the recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs. Accordingly, the amortization of such costs should continue to
be calculated using the interest method and be reported as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 is effective for us in financial statements
issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company believes
the new standard will not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.
The adoption of this standard as of January 1, 2016, did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

30  

In January 2015, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2015-01,  Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)   Simplifying
Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items,  ( ASU 2015-01 ). ASU 2015-01
eliminates from accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. ( U.S. GAAP ) the concept of extraordinary items
and, therefore, it will no longer be necessary for entities to assess items for potential classification as extraordinary items
in their financial statements. The accounting changes in ASU 2015-01 are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from
the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company believes the new standard will not have a material impact on the Company s
results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The adoption of this standard as of January 1, 2016, did not have any
impact on our consolidated financial statements.  

In August 2014, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties
about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ). The amendments in this standard
define management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to
continue as a going concern and provides related footnote disclosure requirements. Under U.S. GAAP, financial statements are prepared
under the presumption that the reporting organization will continue to operate as a going concern, except in limited circumstances.
Financial reporting under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern
basis of accounting establishes the fundamental basis for measuring and classifying assets and liabilities. This standard provides
guidance on when there is substantial doubt about an organization s ability to continue as a going concern and how the underlying
conditions and events should be disclosed in the footnotes. It is intended to reduce diversity that existed in footnote disclosures
because of the lack of guidance about when substantial doubt existed. The amendments in this standard are effective for us beginning
in the first quarter of 2017. Early application is permitted. The Company believes the new standard will not have a material impact
on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ). ASU 2014-09 supersedes nearly all
existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP and requires revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are
transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services.
Additionally, qualitative and quantitative disclosures are required about customer contracts, significant judgments and changes
in judgments, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. This accounting guidance is effective for us
beginning in the first quarter of 2018 using one of two prescribed transition methods. The Company believes the new standard will
not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, equity and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statement and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Making estimates requires
management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition,
situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating
its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future non-conforming events. Accordingly, the actual results could
differ significantly from estimates. Significant items subject to such estimates include but are not limited to the valuation
of stock-based awards, measurement of allowances for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves, the selection of asset useful lives,
fair value estimations used to test long-lived assets, including intangibles, for impairment and provisions necessary for assets
and liabilities. The Company has recorded minimal sales to its distributors during the past nine consecutive quarters. Management s
estimates, including evaluation of impairment of long-lived assets and inventory reserves are based in part on forecasted future
results. A variety of factors could cause actual results to differ from forecasted results and these differences could have a
significant effect on asset carrying amounts.  

Concentrations
of Credit Risk   

Management
regularly reviews accounts receivables, and if necessary, establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects management s
best estimate of amounts that may not be collectible based on historical collection experience and specific customer information.
Bad debt expense recognized as a result of an allowance for doubtful accounts is classified under selling, general and administrative
expenses in the statements of operations. If we are unable to collect our outstanding accounts receivable from our distributors,
or if our distributors are unable or unwilling to purchase our products, our operating results and financial condition will be
adversely affected.  

31  

Fair
Value of Long-Lived Assets   

We
review long-lived assets, including fixed assets and intangibles with finite lives, for recoverability when events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the net carrying amount is greater than its fair value. Assets are grouped and evaluated at the
lowest level for their identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets. We consider
historical performance and future estimated results in our evaluation of potential impairment and then compare the carrying amount
of the asset to the future estimated cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset
exceeds estimated expected undiscounted future cash flows, we measure the amount of impairment by comparing the carrying amount
of the asset to its fair value. The estimation of fair value is generally measured by discounting expected future cash flows at
the rate we utilize to evaluate potential investments. We estimate fair value based on the information available in making the
necessary estimates, judgments and projections.  

Our
policy is to evaluate intangible assets subject to amortization for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Impairment testing of intangible assets subject to amortization
involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows. In the event the carrying
value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows, the carrying value is considered not recoverable and an impairment
exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value, calculated using
a discounted future cash flow method. The computed impairment loss is recognized in the period that the impairment occurs. Assets
which are not impaired may require an adjustment to the remaining useful lives for which to amortize the asset.  

Stock-based
Compensation   

Generally,
stock-based payments are measured at their estimated fair value on the date of grant. Stock-based awards to non-employees are
re-measured at fair value each financial reporting date until performance is complete. Stock-based compensation expense recognized
during a period is based on the estimated number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. For stock options and restricted
stock that do not vest immediately but which contain only a service vesting feature, we recognize compensation cost on the unvested
shares and options on a straight-line basis over the remaining vesting period.  

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and the market price of our common stock
on the date of grant for the fair value of restricted stock issued. Our determination of fair value of stock-based awards is affected
by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include,
but are not limited to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and certain other market variables such
as the risk free interest rate.  

Income
Taxes   

We
account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach which allows for the recognition and measurement of deferred tax
assets based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred
taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax
assets if it is more likely than not these items will either expire before we are able to realize their benefits, or that future
deductibility is uncertain.  

We
record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, if any, based on our estimates of future taxable income as well as tax planning
strategies when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized. If we are able
to utilize more of our deferred tax assets than the net amount previously recorded when unanticipated events occur, an adjustment
to deferred tax assets would increase our net income when those events occur.  

Inventory
Reserves   

Inventories
are valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis.  Our policy is to recognize
an inventory reserve as a loss in earnings in the period in which evidence exists that the market value of inventory is less than
its cost due to damage, physical deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price levels or other causes.  Inventory  market
value  is initially deemed to be current replacement cost, but it cannot be more than the net realizable value, and it cannot
be less than the net realizable value, less an approximate normal profit margin.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling
price in the ordinary course of business, less costs to complete and sell finished goods, including direct selling costs such
as transportation and sales commissions.  The multiple possible outcomes that can result from applying lower of cost or market
can make inventory valuation highly complex.   

32  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

We
are a smaller reporting company, and therefore, we are not required to provide information required by this Item of Form 10-Q.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures    

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose
in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time
periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include,
without limitations, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer s management, including
its principal executive officer or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions,
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

In accordance with Exchange
Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15, an evaluation was completed by Joseph Mannello, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based
on that evaluation, Mr. Mannello concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 

Changes in internal control over financial
reporting  

In connection with the recent changes in the
members of our management team, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. After such assessment,
we concluded that there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30,
2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

33  

PART
II-OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.   

To the knowledge of our
management, except as set forth below, there is no litigation currently pending or contemplated against us, any of our officers
or directors in their capacity as such or against any of our property. 

On October 27, 2016, Cutler
Holdings, L.L.C. ( Cutler ) filed a complaint in the Superior Court of New Jersey alleging that the Company failed
to make certain rental payments that are in dispute in the amount of $257,000, of which $208,000 has been accrued for as of September
30, 2016. The complaint also seeks compensatory and other damages in an unspecified amount. The Company is currently in discussions
with Cutler to resolve the complaint. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

Factors that could cause
our actual results to differ materially from those in this report are any of the risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016. Any of these factors could result in a significant or
material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Additional risk factors not presently known to us
or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business or results of operations. 

As of the date of this report,
except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC, except we may disclose changes to such factors or disclose additional
factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. 

There may not be sufficient
capital resources from operations and existing financing arrangements in order to meet operating expenses and working capital requirements
for the next twelve months. These facts raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.   

Our financial
statements as of September 30, 2016 have been prepared under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern for the next
twelve months. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate profitable operations in the
future and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business
operations when they come due. We plan to continue to provide for our capital requirements by issuing additional equity. No assurance
can be given that additional capital will be available when required or on terms acceptable to us. We also cannot give assurance
that we will achieve sufficient revenues in the future to achieve profitability and cash flow positive operations. The outcome
of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances that, if achieved, we will have sufficient funds
to execute our business plan or to generate positive operating results. If adequate funds are not available to us when we need
it, we may need to curtail our operations which would, in turn, further raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern and hinder our ability to obtain future financing. 

As of
the filing date of this Form 10-Q, management believes that there may not be sufficient capital resources from operations and existing
financing arrangements in order to meet operating expenses and working capital requirements for the next twelve months, primarily
due to the failure of RENS Technology Inc. to fund the required amounts. These facts raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, we are evaluating various alternatives, including reducing operating expenses,
securing additional financing for future business activities and other strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be able to generate the level of operating revenues in its business plan, or if additional sources of financing will
be available on acceptable terms, if at all. If no additional sources of financing are available, our future operating prospects
may be adversely affected.
