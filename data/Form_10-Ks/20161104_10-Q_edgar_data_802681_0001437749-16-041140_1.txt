    Notes      to Consolidated Financial Statements    
   (Unaudited)    
     
   Note 1 - Basis of Presentation    
     
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). In the opinion of Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation s (the  Corporation ) management, all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been included. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in the Corporation s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Annual Report ).   
     
  The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.   
     
   Note 2 - Earnings per Common Share    
     
  Basic earnings per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share takes into account the potential dilution computed pursuant to the treasury stock method that could occur if stock options were exercised and converted into common stock, as well as the effect of restricted and performance shares becoming unrestricted common stock. The effects of stock options are excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share in periods in which the effect would be anti-dilutive. All weighted average shares, actual shares and per share information in the financial statements have been adjusted retroactively for the effect of stock dividends and splits.   

Note 3 - Business Combinations    
     
   Robert J. McAllister Agency, Inc. ( RJM )   
     
  The acquisition of RJM, an insurance brokerage headquartered in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, was completed on April 1, 2015. The consideration paid by the Corporation was $1.0 million, of which $500 thousand was paid at closing, with five contingent cash payments, not to exceed $100 thousand each, to be payable on each of March 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, March 31, 2018, March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020, subject to the attainment of certain revenue targets during the related periods. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the first contingent payment in the amount of $85 thousand was issued. The acquisition enhanced the Corporation s ability to offer comprehensive insurance solutions to both individual and business clients.

Table Of Contents 

In connection with the RJM acquisition, the following table details the consideration paid, the initial estimated fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition and subsequent adjustments, during the measurement period, to the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the resulting goodwill recorded  :  

During the three months ended December 31, 2015, a measurement-period adjustment was made which eliminated the value initially placed on the trade name (and its associated deferred tax liability), as the entity was immediately merged into PCPB.  
     
  As of December 31, 2015, the estimates of fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of RJM were finalized.  
     
   Continental Bank Holdings, Inc.    
     
  On January 1, 2015, the previously announced merger of Continental Bank Holdings, Inc. ( CBH ) with and into the Corporation, and the merger of Continental Bank with and into the Bank (collectively, the  Merger ) as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and between CBH and the Corporation, dated as of May 5, 2014 (as amended by the Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 23, 2014, the  Agreement ), were completed. In accordance with the Agreement, the aggregate share consideration paid to CBH shareholders consisted of 3,878,383 shares (which included fractional shares paid in cash) of the Corporation s common stock. Shareholders of CBH received 0.45 shares of Corporation common stock for each share of CBH common stock they owned as of the effective date of the Merger. Holders of options to purchase shares of CBH common stock received options to purchase shares of Corporation common stock, converted at the same ratio of 0.45. In addition, $1.3 million was paid to certain warrant holders to cash-out certain warrants. In accordance with the acquisition method of accounting, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were preliminarily adjusted to their fair values as of the date of the Merger. The excess of consideration paid above the fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. This goodwill is not amortizable nor is it deductible for income tax purposes.

Table Of Contents 

In connection with the Merger, the following table details the consideration paid, the initial estimated fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition and the subsequent adjustments, during the measurement period, to the fair value of the assets acquired, liabilities assumed and the resulting goodwill recorded  :  

*includes $507 thousand in loans held for sale    
     
  During the measurement period subsequent to the Merger, adjustments to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were related to circumstances that existed prior to the Merger date, but that were not known to the Corporation. The adjustments included reductions in the fair value of certain loans, unrecorded liabilities of CBH, and an immaterial adjustment to the calculation of a favorable lease asset, which reduced its value, along with the associated deferred tax items.  
     
  As of December 31, 2015, the estimates of fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Merger were finalized.

Due Diligence, Merger-Related and Merger Integration Expenses   
       
  Due diligence, merger-related and merger integration expenses include consultant costs, investment banker fees, contract breakage fees, retention bonuses for severed employees, and salary and wages for redundant staffing involved in the integration of the institutions. The following table details the costs identified and classified as due diligence, merger-related and merger integration costs for the periods indicated:  

Note 4 - Investment Securities   

The amortized cost and fair value of investment securities  available for sale  are as follows:   
     
   As of   September   30, 2016    

As of December 31, 2015

The following tables detail the amount of investment securities  available for sale  that were in an unrealized loss position as of the dates indicated:    As of September 30, 2016      

As of December 31, 2015   

Management evaluates the Corporation s investment securities available for sale that are in an unrealized loss position in order to determine if the decline in fair value is other than temporary. The available for sale investment portfolio includes debt securities issued by U.S. government agencies, U.S. government-sponsored agencies, state and local municipalities and other issuers. All fixed income investment securities in the Corporation s available for sale investment portfolio are rated as investment grade. Factors considered in the evaluation include the current economic climate, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, interest rates and the bond rating of each security. The unrealized losses presented in the tables above are temporary in nature and are primarily related to market interest rates rather than the underlying credit quality of the issuers. The Corporation does not believe that these unrealized losses are other-than-temporary. The Corporation does not have the intent to sell these securities prior to their maturity or the recovery of their cost bases and believes that it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell these securities prior to their maturity or the recovery of their cost bases.   
     
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, securities having fair values of $130.8 million and $128.9 million, respectively, were specifically pledged as collateral for public funds, trust deposits, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia discount window program, Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh ( FHLB ) borrowings and other purposes. The FHLB has a blanket lien on non-pledged, mortgage-related loans and securities as part of the Corporation s borrowing agreement with the FHLB.

As part of the process of determining the Allowance for the different segments of the loan and lease portfolio, Management considers certain credit quality indicators. For the commercial mortgage, construction and commercial and industrial loan segments, periodic reviews of the individual loans are performed by both in-house staff as well as external loan reviewers. The result of these reviews is reflected in the risk grade assigned to each loan. These internally assigned grades are as follows:  

Pass   Loans considered satisfactory with no indications of deterioration.     

Special mention - Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date.     

Substandard - Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and payment capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard loans have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.     

Doubtful - Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.      
     
  In addition, for the remaining segments of the loan and lease portfolio, which include residential mortgage, home equity lines and loans, consumer, and leases, the credit quality indicator used to determine this component of the Allowance is based on performance status.  
     
  The following tables detail the carrying value of  all  portfolio loans and leases by portfolio segment based on the credit quality indicators used to determine the Allowance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

G. Troubled Debt Restructurings ( TDRs )   
     
  The restructuring of a loan is considered a  troubled debt restructuring  if both of the following conditions are met: (i) the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, and (ii) the creditor has granted a concession. The most common concessions granted include one or more modifications to the terms of the debt, such as (a) a reduction in the interest rate for the remaining life of the debt, (b) an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, (c) a temporary period of interest-only payments, (d) a reduction in the contractual payment amount for either a short period or remaining term of the loan, and (e) for leases, a reduced lease payment. A less common concession granted is the forgiveness of a portion of the principal.   
     
  The determination of whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties takes into account not only the current financial condition of the borrower, but also the potential financial condition of the borrower, were a concession not granted. Similarly, the determination of whether a concession has been granted is very subjective in nature. For example, simply extending the term of a loan at its original interest rate or even at a higher interest rate could be interpreted as a concession unless the borrower could readily obtain similar credit terms from a different lender.   

The following table presents the balance of TDRs as of the indicated dates:

I. Loan Mark   
     
  Loans acquired in mergers and acquisitions are recorded at fair value as of the date of the transaction. This adjustment to the acquired principal amount is referred to as the  Loan Mark . With the exception of purchased credit impaired loans, whose Loan Mark is accounted for under ASC 310-30, the Loan Mark is amortized or accreted as an adjustment to yield over the lives of the loans. The following tables detail, for  acquired loans , the outstanding principal, remaining loan mark, and recorded investment, by portfolio segment, as of the dates indicated:

The Corporation has the option to prepay these advances, without penalty, if the FHLB elects to convert the interest rate to an adjustable rate. As of September 30, 2016, substantially all FHLB advances with this convertible feature are subject to conversion in fiscal 2016. These advances are included in the maturity ranges in which they mature, rather than the period in which they are subject to conversion.

The amount of FHLB capital stock held was $13.2 million and $12.9 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The carrying amount of the FHLB capital stock is its redemption value.  
     
   Note 8   Stock-Based Compensation    

A. General Information    
     
  Prior to April 25, 2007, all shares authorized for grant as stock-based compensation were limited to grants of stock options. On April 25, 2007, the shareholders of the Corporation approved the Corporation s  2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan  (the  2007 LTIP ) under which a total of 428,996 shares of the Corporation s common stock were made available for award grants. On April 28, 2010, the shareholders of the Corporation approved the Corporation s  2010 Long Term Incentive Plan  (the  2010 LTIP ) under which a total of 445,002 shares of the Corporation s common stock were made available for award grants. On April 30, 2015, the shareholders of the Corporation approved the Amended and Restated Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation 2010 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Amended 2010 LTIP ), under which the total number of shares of Corporation Common Stock made available for award grants was increased by 500,000 shares to 945,002 shares.   
     
  In addition to the shareholder-approved plans mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Corporation periodically authorizes grants of stock-based compensation as inducement awards to new employees. This type of award does not require shareholder approval in accordance with Rule 5635(c)(4) of the Nasdaq listing rules.  
     
  Equity awards are authorized to be in the form of, among others, options to purchase the Corporation s common stock, restricted stock awards or units ( RSAs  or  RSUs ) and performance stock awards or units ( PSAs  or  PSUs ).  
     
  RSAs and RSUs have a restriction based on the passage of time and may also have a restriction based on non-market-related performance criteria. The fair value of the RSAs and RSUs is based on the closing price on the day preceding the date of the grant.   
     
  The PSAs and PSUs also have a restriction based on the passage of time, but also have a restriction based on performance criteria related to the Corporation s total shareholder return relative to the performance of the community bank index for the respective period. The amount of PSAs or PSUs earned will not exceed 100% of the PSAs or PSUs awarded. The fair value of the PSAs and PSUs is calculated using the Monte Carlo Simulation method.   
     
   B. Stock Options   
     
  Stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the vesting period. The fair value of stock option grants is determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The assumptions necessary for the calculation of the fair value are expected life of options, annual volatility of stock price, risk-free interest rate and annual dividend yield.   
     
  The following table provides information about options outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016:

C. Restricted Stock Awards and Performance Stock Awards   
     
  The Corporation has granted RSAs, RSUs, PSAs and PSUs under the 2007 LTIP, 2010 LTIP and Amended 2010 LTIP.  
     
   RSAs and RSUs   
     
  The compensation expense for the RSAs and RSUs is measured based on the market price of the stock on the day prior to the grant date and is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period.  
     
  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recognized $152 thousand and $414 thousand, respectively, of expense related to the Corporation s RSAs and RSUs. As of September 30, 2016, there was $1.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to RSAs and RSUs. This cost will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.6 years.  
     
  The following table details the unvested RSAs and RSUs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recorded $4 thousand and $10 thousand excess tax benefits related to the vesting of RSAs and RSUs.

Note 9 - Pension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans    
     
  Prior to the December 2015 settlement of the qualified defined benefits plan (the  QDBP ), the Corporation had three defined benefit pension plans: the QDBP which covered all employees over age 20 1/2 who met certain service requirements, and two non-qualified defined-benefit pension plans ( SERP I  and  SERP II ) which are restricted to certain senior officers of the Corporation.   
     
  SERP I provides each participant with the equivalent pension benefit provided by the QDBP on any compensation and bonus deferrals that exceed the IRS limit applicable to the QDBP.  
     
  On February 12, 2008, the Corporation amended the QDBP and SERP I to freeze further increases in the defined-benefit amounts to all participants, effective March 31, 2008.   
     
  On April 1, 2008, the Corporation added SERP II, a non-qualified defined-benefit plan which was restricted to certain senior officers of the Corporation. Effective January 1, 2013, the Corporation curtailed SERP II, as further increases to the defined-benefit amounts to over 20% of the participants were frozen.  
     
  On May 29, 2015, by unanimous consent, the Board of Directors of the Corporation voted to terminate the QDBP. On June 2, 2015, notices were sent to participants informing them of the termination. Final distributions to participants were completed by December 31, 2015.   
     
  The Corporation also has a postretirement benefit plan ( PRBP ) that covers certain retired employees and a group of current employees. The PRBP was closed to new participants in 1994. In 2007, the Corporation amended the PRBP to allow for settlement of obligations to certain current and retired employees. Certain retired participant obligations were settled in 2007 and current employee obligations were settled in 2008.

The following tables provide details of the components of the net periodic benefits cost (benefit) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

QDBP:  The QDBP was settled as of December 31, 2015. As such, no contributions were made during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
   SERP I and SERP II:  The Corporation contributed $70 thousand and $200 thousand during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and is expected to contribute an additional $70 thousand to the SERP I and SERP II plans for the remaining three months of 2016.   
     
   PRBP:  In 2005, the Corporation capped the maximum annual payment under the PRBP at 120% of the 2005 benefit. This maximum was reached in 2008 and the cap is not expected to be increased above this level.   
     
   Note 10 - Segment Information    
     
  FASB Codification 280    Segment Reporting  identifies operating segments as components of an enterprise which are evaluated regularly by the Corporation s Chief Operating Decision Maker, our Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. The Corporation has applied the aggregation criterion set forth in this codification to the results of its operations.   
     
  The Corporation s Banking segment consists of commercial and retail banking. The Banking segment is evaluated as a single strategic unit which generates revenues from a variety of products and services. The Banking segment generates interest income from its lending (including leasing) and investing activities and is dependent on the gathering of lower cost deposits from its branch network or borrowed funds from other sources for funding its loans, resulting in the generation of net interest income. The Banking segment also derives revenues from other sources including gains on the sale of available for sale investment securities, gains on the sale of residential mortgage loans, service charges on deposit accounts, cash sweep fees, overdraft fees, BOLI income and interchange revenue associated with its Visa Check Card offering.   
     
  The Wealth Management segment has responsibility for a number of activities within the Corporation, including trust administration, other related fiduciary services, custody, investment management and advisory services, employee benefits and IRA administration, estate settlement, tax services and brokerage. Bryn Mawr Trust of Delaware and Lau Associates are included in the Wealth Management segment of the Corporation since they have similar economic characteristics, products and services to those of the Wealth Management Division of the Corporation. Powers Craft Parker and Beard ( PCPB ), which was merged with the Corporation s existing insurance subsidiary, Insurance Counsellors of Bryn Mawr ( ICBM ), and RJM, which was acquired on April 1, 2015, now operate under the Powers Craft Parker and Beard, Inc. name. The Wealth Management Division has assumed oversight responsibility for all insurance services of the Corporation. Prior to the PCPB and RJM acquisitions, ICBM was reported through the Banking segment. Any adjustments to prior year figures are immaterial and are not reflected in the tables below.

Note 11 - Mortgage Servicing Rights    
     
  The following table summarizes the Corporation s activity related to mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of MSRs to immediate 10 and 20 percent adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows:   

*    
 
   Represents the weighted average prepayment rate for the life of the MSR asset.       
     
  These assumptions and sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution. Changes in fair value based on a 10% variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the MSRs is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another, which could magnify or counteract the sensitivities.

  On October 20, 2016, the Corporation s Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share payable December 1, 2016 to shareholders of record as of November 2, 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, the Corporation paid or accrued, as applicable, a regular quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share. This dividend totaled $3.6 million, based on outstanding shares and restricted stock units as of August 4, 2016 of 17,083,626 shares.   
     
   S-3 Shelf Registration Statement and Offerings Thereunder        
     
  In March 2015, the Corporation filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (the  Shelf Registration Statement ) to replace its 2012 Shelf Registration Statement, which was set to expire in April 2015. The Shelf Registration Statement allows the Corporation to raise additional capital through offers and sales of registered securities consisting of common stock, debt securities, warrants to purchase common stock, stock purchase contracts and units or units consisting of any combination of the foregoing securities. Using the prospectus in the Shelf Registration Statement, together with applicable prospectus supplements, the Corporation may sell, from time to time, in one or more offerings, such securities in a dollar amount up to $200 million, in the aggregate.   
     
  In addition, the Corporation has in place under its Shelf Registration Statement a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan (the  Plan ), which allows it to issue up to 1,500,000 shares of registered common stock. The Plan allows for the grant of a request for waiver ( RFW ) above the Plan s maximum investment of $120 thousand per account per year. An RFW is granted based on a variety of factors, including the Corporation s current and projected capital needs, prevailing market prices of the Corporation s common stock and general economic and market conditions.  
     
   Options   In addition to shares that may be issued through the Plan, the Corporation also issues shares through the exercise of stock options. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, 27,595 shares and 60,398 shares, respectively, were issued pursuant to the exercise of stock options, increasing shareholders  equity by $559 thousand and $1.2 million, respectively.  
     
   Stock Repurchases   
     
  On August 6, 2015, the Corporation announced a stock repurchase program (the  2015 Program ) under which the Corporation may repurchase up to 1,200,000 shares of the Corporation s common stock, at an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $40 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Corporation repurchased 286,700 shares under the 2015 Program at an average price of $27.80 per share. No shares were repurchased under the 2015 Program during the six months ended September 30, 2016. All share repurchases under the 2015 Program were accomplished in open market transactions. As of September 30, 2016, the maximum number of shares remaining authorized for repurchase under the 2015 Program was 189,300. In addition to the 2015 Program, it is the Corporation s practice to retire shares to its treasury account upon the vesting of stock awards to certain officers in order to cover the statutory income tax withholdings related to such vestings.  
     
   Note 15 - Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes    
     
  The Corporation recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the Corporation would be more likely than not to sustain the position following an examination. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the relevant tax authority.   
     
  The Corporation is subject to income taxes in the United States federal jurisdiction and multiple state jurisdictions. The Corporation is no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examination by taxing authorities for years before 2013.   
     
  The Corporation s policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as income tax expense. No interest or penalties were accrued for the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016 or 2015.   
     
   Note 16 - Fair Value Measurement    
     
  The following disclosures are made in conjunction with the application of fair value measurements.   
     
  FASB ASC 820  Fair Value Measurement  establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the nature of data inputs for fair value determinations, under which the Corporation is required to value each asset using assumptions that market participants would utilize to value that asset. When the Corporation uses its own assumptions, it is required to disclose additional information about the assumptions used and the effect of the measurement on earnings or the net change in assets for the period.

Table Of Contents 

The Corporation s investment securities available for sale, which generally include state and municipal securities, U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-related securities, are reported at fair value. These securities are valued by an independent third party. The third party s evaluations are based on market data. They utilize evaluated pricing models that vary by asset and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. For securities that do not trade on a daily basis, their pricing applications apply available information such as benchmarking and matrix pricing. The market inputs normally sought in the evaluation of securities include benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes (only obtained from market makers or broker/dealers recognized as market participants), issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data. For certain securities, additional inputs may be used or some market inputs may not be applicable. Inputs are prioritized differently on any given day based on market conditions.   
     
  U.S. Government agency securities are evaluated and priced using multi-dimensional relational models and option-adjusted spreads. State and municipal securities are evaluated on a series of matrices including reported trades and material event notices. Mortgage-related securities are evaluated using matrix correlation to treasury or floating index benchmarks, prepayment speeds, monthly payment information and other benchmarks. Other available for sale investments are evaluated using a broker-quote based application, including quotes from issuers. The Corporation has a sufficient understanding of the third party service s valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of available for sale investments to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control.  
     
  The value of the investment portfolio is determined using three broad levels of inputs:   
     
   Level 1    Quoted prices in active markets for identical securities.   
     
   Level 2    Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.    
     
   Level 3    Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.   
     
  These levels are not necessarily an indication of the risks or liquidity associated with these investments. The following tables summarize the assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 that are recognized on the Corporation s balance sheet using fair value measurement determined based on the differing levels of input.   

The following table sets forth the fair value of assets measured on a recurring and non-recurring basis as of September 30, 2016:

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1 thousand was recorded in the Allowance as a result of adjusting the carrying value and estimated fair value of the impaired loans in the above tables. As it relates to the fair values of assets measured on a recurring basis, there have been no transfers between levels during the three months ended September 30, 2016.   
    Impaired Loans   
     
  The Corporation evaluates and values impaired loans at the time the loan is identified as impaired, and the fair values of such loans are estimated using Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Each loan s collateral has a unique appraisal and management s discount of the value is based on the factors unique to each impaired loan. The significant unobservable input in determining the fair value is management s subjective discount on appraisals of the collateral securing the loan, which range from 10% - 50%. Collateral may consist of real estate and/or business assets including equipment, inventory and/or accounts receivable and the value of these assets is determined based on the appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the Corporation. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, estimated costs to sell, and/or management s expertise and knowledge of the client and the client s business.   
     
  The Corporation has an appraisal policy in which an appraisal is obtained for a commercial loan at the point at which the loan either becomes nonperforming or is downgraded to a substandard or worse classification. For consumer loans, the Corporation obtains updated appraisals when a loan becomes 90 days past due or when it receives other information that may indicate possible impairment. Based on the appraisals obtained by the Corporation, an appropriate Allowance is allocated to the particular loan.   
     
   Other Real Estate Owned    
  Other real estate owned consists of properties acquired as a result of foreclosures and deeds in-lieu-of foreclosure. Properties are classified as OREO and are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell, and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.  

Mortgage Servicing Rights   
     
  MSRs do not trade in an active, open market with readily observable prices. Accordingly, the Corporation obtains the fair value of the MSRs using a third-party pricing provider. The provider determines the fair value by discounting projected net servicing cash flows of the remaining servicing portfolio. The valuation model used by the provider considers market loan prepayment predictions and other economic factors which the Corporation considers to be significant unobservable inputs. The fair value of MSRs is mostly affected by changes in mortgage interest rates since rate changes cause the loan prepayment acceleration factors to increase or decrease. All assumptions are market driven. The Corporation has a sufficient understanding of the third party service s valuation models, assumptions and inputs used in determining the fair value of MSRs to enable management to maintain an appropriate system of internal control. Mortgage servicing rights are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy as the valuation is model driven and primarily based on unobservable inputs.  

Note 17 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments    
     
  FASB ASC 825,  Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments  requires disclosure of the fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate such value. In cases where quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on estimates using present value or other fair value techniques. Those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows. In that regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument. The aggregate fair value amounts presented below do not represent the underlying value of the Corporation.   
     
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:  
     
   Cash and Cash Equivalents   
     
  The carrying amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents approximate their fair values.   
     
   Investment Securities   
     
  Estimated fair values for investment securities are generally valued by an independent third party based on market data, utilizing pricing models that vary by asset and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information. Management reviews, annually, the process utilized by its independent third-party valuation experts. On a quarterly basis, Management tests the validity of the prices provided by the third party by selecting a representative sample of the portfolio and obtaining actual trade results, or if actual trade results are not available, competitive broker pricing. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.

Table Of Contents 

Loans Held for Sale   
     
  The fair value of loans held for sale is based on pricing obtained from secondary markets.   
     
   Net Portfolio Loans and Leases   
     
  For variable-rate loans that re-price frequently and which have no significant change in credit risk, estimated fair values are based on carrying values. Fair values of certain mortgage loans and consumer loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality and is indicative of an entry price. The estimated fair value of nonperforming loans is based on discounted estimated cash flows as determined by the internal loan review of the Corporation or the appraised fair value of the underlying collateral, as determined by independent third party appraisers. This technique does not reflect an exit price.  
     
   Impaired Loans   
     
  The Corporation evaluates and values impaired loans at the time the loan is identified as impaired, and the fair values of such loans are estimated using Level 3 inputs in the fair value hierarchy. Each loan s collateral has a unique appraisal and management s discount of the value is based on the factors unique to each impaired loan. The significant unobservable input in determining the fair value is management s subjective discount on appraisals of the collateral securing the loan, which range from 10% - 50%. Collateral may consist of real estate and/or business assets including equipment, inventory and/or accounts receivable and the value of these assets is determined based on the appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers hired by the Corporation. Appraised and reported values may be discounted based on management s historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of valuation, estimated costs to sell, and/or management s expertise and knowledge of the client and the client s business.  
     
   Mortgage Servicing Rights   
     
  The fair value of the MSRs for these periods was determined using a proprietary third-party valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future servicing income. The model incorporates assumptions that market participants use in estimating future net servicing income, including estimates of prepayment speeds and discount rates. Due to the proprietary nature of the valuation model used, the Corporation classifies the value of MSRs as using Level 3 inputs.  
     
   Other Assets   
     
  The carrying amount of FHLB stock, accrued interest receivable, income taxes receivable and other investments are their fair values.  
     
   Deposits   
     
  The estimated fair values disclosed for noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings, NOW accounts, and market rate accounts are, by definition, equal to the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amounts). Fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of expected monthly maturities on the certificate of deposit. FASB Codification 825 defines the fair value of demand deposits as the amount payable on demand as of the reporting date and prohibits adjusting estimated fair value from any value derived from retaining those deposits for an expected future period of time.  
     
   Short-term borrowings   
     
  The carrying amount of short-term borrowings, which include overnight repurchase agreements, fed funds and FHLB advances with original maturity of one year or less, approximates their fair value.   
     
   Long-term FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings   
     
  The fair value of long-term FHLB advances and other borrowings (with original maturities of greater than one year) is established using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on mid-term and long term borrowings.   
     
   Subordinated Notes   
     
  The fair value of the Notes is estimated by discounting the principal balance using the FHLB yield curve for the term to the call date as the Corporation has the option to call the Notes. The Notes are classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  
     
   Other Liabilities   
     
  The carrying amounts of accrued interest payable and other accrued payables are their fair values.   
     
   Off-Balance Sheet Instruments   
     
  Estimated fair values of the Corporation s commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit and financial guarantees are not included in the table below as their carrying values generally approximate their fair values. These instruments generate fees that approximate those currently charged to originate similar commitments.

   Note 18 - New Accounting Pronouncements   
       
   FASB ASU 2016-09 (Topic 718),  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting    
       
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which changes several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) Accounting and Cash Flow Classification for Excess Tax Benefits and Deficiencies, (2) Forfeitures, and (3) Tax Withholding Requirements and Cash Flow Classification. The standard is effective for public business entities in annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted if the entire standard is adopted. If an entity early adopts the standard in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Corporation early-adopted ASU 2016-09 during the three months ended September 30, 2016. As a result of the adoption, the Corporation recognized a $385 thousand and $445 thousand tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The impact of the income tax benefit or expense related to ASU 2016-09 is treated as a discrete item in the calculation of the year-to-date income tax expense. Also, in accordance with the provisions of ASU 2016-09, the Corporation presents excess tax benefits as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows using a retrospective transition method. Adoption of all other changes did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.   

FASB ASU 2016-1  5   (Topic 32  0  ),    Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and     Cash Payments      
       
  Issued in August 2016, ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on eight specific cash flow issues and their disclosure in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The issues addressed include debt prepayment, settlement of zero-coupon debt, contingent consideration in business combinations, proceeds from settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from settlement of BOLI, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions, and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the Predominance principle. 2016-15 is effective for the annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Corporation is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-15 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
       
   FASB ASU 2016-13 (Topic 326),  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments    
       
  Issued in June 2016, ASU 2016-13 significantly changes how companies measure and recognize credit impairment for many financial assets. The new current expected credit loss model will require companies to immediately recognize an estimate of credit losses expected to occur over the remaining life of the financial assets that are in the scope of the standard. The ASU also makes targeted amendments to the current impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Corporation is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

FASB ASU 2016-02 (Topic 842),  Leases    
       
  Issued in February 2016, ASU 2016-02 revises the accounting related to lessee accounting. Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases. The new lease guidance also simplifies the accounting for sale and leaseback transactions primarily because lessees must recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the first interim period within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The standard is required to be adopted using the modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Corporation is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
       
   FASB ASU 2016-01 (Subtopic 825-10),  Financial Instruments   Overall, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities    
       
  Issued in January 2016, ASU 2016-01 provides that equity investments will be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. When fair value is not readily determinable an entity may elect to measure the equity investment at cost, minus impairment, plus or minus any change in the investment s observable price. For financial liabilities that are measured at fair value, the amendment requires an entity to present separately, in other comprehensive income, any change in fair value resulting from a change in instrument-specific credit risk. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Entities may apply this guidance on a prospective or retrospective basis. The Corporation is evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

ITEM      2 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operation and Financial Condition     
     
  The following is the Corporation s discussion and analysis of the significant changes in the financial condition, results of operations, capital resources and liquidity presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Current performance does not guarantee, and may not be indicative of, similar performance in the future.  
        
   Brief History of the Corporation    
     
  The Bryn Mawr Trust Company (the  Bank ) received its Pennsylvania banking charter in 1889 and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. In 1986, Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation (the  Corporation ) was formed and on January 2, 1987, the Bank became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation. The Bank and Corporation are headquartered in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, a western suburb of Philadelphia. The Corporation and its subsidiaries provide community banking, business banking, residential mortgage lending, consumer and commercial lending to customers through its 25 full-service branches, eight limited-hour retirement community offices, and one limited-service branch located throughout the Montgomery, Delaware, Chester and Dauphin counties of Pennsylvania and New Castle county in Delaware. The Corporation and its subsidiaries also provide wealth management and insurance advisory services through its network of Wealth Management and insurance offices located in Bryn Mawr, Rosemont, Devon and Hershey, Pennsylvania as well as Greenville, Delaware. The Corporation s stock trades on the NASDAQ Stock Market ( NASDAQ ) under the symbol BMTC. The goal of the Corporation is to become the preeminent community bank and wealth management organization in the Philadelphia area.   
     
  The Corporation operates in a highly competitive market area that includes local, national and regional banks as competitors along with savings banks, credit unions, insurance companies, trust companies, registered investment advisors and mutual fund families. The Corporation and its subsidiaries are regulated by many agencies including the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), NASDAQ, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ), the Federal Reserve Board and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities  .  
     
   Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Estimates    
     
  The accounting and reporting policies of the Corporation and its subsidiaries conform with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ). All inter-company transactions are eliminated in consolidation and certain reclassifications are made when necessary to conform the previous year s financial statements to the current year s presentation. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the balance sheets and revenues and expenditures for the periods presented. However, there are uncertainties inherent in making these estimates and actual results could differ from these estimates. The Corporation has identified certain areas that require estimates and assumptions, which include the allowance for loan and lease losses (the  Allowance ), the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, the fair value of investment securities, and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets and liabilities, benefit plans and stock-based compensation.   
     
  These critical accounting policies, along with other significant accounting policies, are presented in Footnote 1   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Corporation s 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K (the  2015 Annual Report ).   
     
   Acquisition of Robert J. McAllister Agency, Inc. ( RJM )   
     
  The acquisition of RJM, an insurance brokerage headquartered in Rosemont, Pennsylvania, was completed on April 1, 2015. The consideration paid by the Corporation was $1.0 million, of which $500 thousand was paid at closing and five contingent cash payments, not to exceed $100 thousand each, are payable on each of March 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, March 31, 2018, March 31, 2019, and March 31, 2020, subject to the attainment of certain revenue targets during the related periods. The first of these contingent payments, in the amount of $85 thousand, was paid during the second quarter of 2016. The acquisition enhanced the Corporation s ability to offer comprehensive insurance solutions to both individual and business clients.  
        
   Acquisit  ion of Continental Bank Holdings, Inc. ( CBH )   
     
  On January 1, 2015, the previously announced merger (the  Merger  or the  Continental Merger ) of CBH with and into the Corporation, and the merger of Continental Bank with and into The Bryn Mawr Trust Company, the wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation (the  Bank ), as contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger, by and between CBH and the Corporation, dated as of May 5, 2014 (as amended by the Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 23, 2014, the  Agreement ), were completed. In accordance with the Agreement, the aggregate share consideration paid to CBH shareholders consisted of 3,878,383 shares (which included fractional shares paid in cash) of the Corporation s common stock. Shareholders of CBH received 0.45 shares of Corporation common stock for each share of CBH common stock they owned as of the effective date of the Merger. Holders of options to purchase shares of CBH common stock received options to purchase shares of Corporation common stock, converted at the same ratio of 0.45. In addition, $1,323,000 was paid to certain warrant holders to cash-out certain warrants. The aggregate consideration paid to former CBH shareholders totaled $125.1 million.

Components of Net Income    
       
  Net income is comprised of five major elements:      

Net Interest Income , or the difference between the interest income earned on loans, leases and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds;     

Provision For Loan and Lease Losses , or the amount added to the Allowance to provide for estimated inherent losses on portfolio loans and leases;      

Non-Interest Income,  which is made up primarily of Wealth Management revenue, insurance revenue, gains and losses from the sale loans, gains and losses from the sale of investment securities available for sale and other fees from loan and deposit services;      

Non-Interest Expense , which consists primarily of salaries and employee benefits, occupancy, intangible asset amortization, professional fees and other operating expenses; and      

Income Taxes , which include state and federal jurisdictions.     
     
   TAX-EQUIVALENT NET INTEREST INCOME   
     
  Net interest income is the primary source of the Corporation s revenue. The below tables present a summary, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, of the Corporation s average balances and tax-equivalent yields earned on its interest-earning assets and the tax-equivalent rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities. The tax-equivalent net interest margin is the tax-equivalent net interest income as a percentage of average interest-earning assets. The tax-equivalent net interest spread is the difference between the weighted average tax-equivalent yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average cost of interest-bearing liabilities. The effect of noninterest-bearing liabilities represents the effect on the net interest margin of net funding provided by noninterest-earning assets, noninterest-bearing liabilities and shareholders  equity.   
     
  Tax-equivalent net interest income increased $1.9 million, or 7.6%, to $26.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $25.0 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in net interest income between the periods was largely related to the increase in average loans for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Average loans for the third quarter of 2016 increased by $285.3 million from the same period in 2015, while the yield earned on loans decreased by 15 basis points. Partially offsetting the increase in average loans was an $84.7 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits accompanied by a 10 basis point increase in the rate paid on those deposits. In addition, average long-term FHLB advances decreased by $29.7 million, offset by increases of $12.8 million and $11.3 million in short-term borrowings and subordinated notes, respectively, between the periods.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, tax equivalent net interest income increased by $4.6 million, or 6.2%, from the same period in 2015. Largely contributing to the increase in tax-equivalent net interest income was the $268.4 million increase in average loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, which was partially offset by a $145.5 million decrease in average interest-bearing deposits with banks, as these funds were redeployed from lower-earning deposit accounts to fund loan originations. Partially offsetting this net growth in average interest-earning assets was a $49.0 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits between periods.

Tax-Equivalent Net Interest Margin   
          
  The tax-equivalent net interest margin of 3.71% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was a 6 basis point increase from the same period in 2015. The primary reason for the improvement in the margin was the shift in earning assets from low-yielding interest-earning deposits with banks, to much higher yielding loans and investment securities.  
       
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the tax-equivalent net interest margin increased by 4 basis points from 3.75% to 3.79%. The primary driver for the increase in tax-equivalent net interest margin was a $145.5 decrease in low-yielding average interest-bearing deposits with banks, coupled with a $268.4 million increase in higher-yielding average loans and leases. The contribution from the accretion of fair value marks to the margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 14 basis points, as compared to 20 basis points for the same period in 2015.   

The tax-equivalent net interest margin and related components for the past five consecutive quarters are shown in the table below: 

Interest Rate Sensitivity    
     
  The Corporation actively manages its interest rate sensitivity position. The objectives of interest rate risk management are to control exposure of net interest income to risks associated with interest rate movements and to achieve sustainable growth in net interest income. The Corporation s Asset Liability Committee ( ALCO ), using policies and procedures approved by the Corporation s Board of Directors, is responsible for the management of the Corporation s interest rate sensitivity position. The Corporation manages interest rate sensitivity by changing the mix, pricing and re-pricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities, through the management of its investment portfolio, its offerings of loan and selected deposit terms and through wholesale funding. Wholesale funding consists of multiple sources including borrowings from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia s discount window, certificates of deposit from institutional brokers, including the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ( CDARS ), the Insured Network Deposit ( IND ) Program, the Charity Deposits Corporation ( CDC ), the Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS ) and the Pennsylvania Local Government Investment Trust ( PLGIT ).   
     
  The Corporation uses several tools to manage its interest rate risk including interest rate sensitivity analysis, or gap analysis, market value of portfolio equity analysis, interest rate simulations under various rate scenarios and tax-equivalent net interest margin reports. The results of these reports are compared to limits established by the Corporation s ALCO policies and appropriate adjustments are made if the results are outside the established limits.   
     
  The following table demonstrates the annualized result of an interest rate simulation and the estimated effect that a parallel interest rate shift, or  shock , in the yield curve and subjective adjustments in deposit pricing, might have on the Corporation s projected net interest income over the next 12 months.   
     
  This simulation assumes that there is no growth in interest-earning assets or interest-bearing liabilities over the next 12 months. The changes to net interest income shown below are in compliance with the Corporation s policy guidelines.  
     
   Summary of Interest Rate Simulation      

The above interest rate simulation suggests that the Corporation s balance sheet is asset sensitive as of September 30, 2016 in the +100 basis point scenario, which is similar to the December 31, 2015 simulation. Asset sensitivity table indicates that a 100, 200 or 300 basis point increase in interest rates would have a positive impact on net interest income over the next 12 months. The balance sheet is more asset sensitive in comparison to December 31, 2015. This is a result of the decline in low interest earning cash balances which was redeployed into higher earning investment and loan assets, but was partially offset by slight increases in funding costs.

The interest rate simulation is an estimate based on assumptions, which are derived from past behavior of customers, along with expectations of future behavior relative to interest rate changes. In today s uncertain economic environment and the current extended period of very low interest rates, the reliability of the Corporation s assumptions in the interest rate simulation model is more uncertain than in other periods. Actual customer behavior may be different than expected behavior, which could cause an unexpected outcome and may result in lower net interest income.  
             
   Gap Analysis   
     
  The interest sensitivity, or gap analysis, shows interest rate risk by identifying re-pricing gaps in the Corporation s balance sheet. All assets and liabilities are categorized in the following table according to their behavioral sensitivity, which is usually the earliest of either: re-pricing, maturity, contractual amortization, prepayments or likely call dates. Non-maturity deposits, such as NOW, savings and money market accounts are spread over various time periods based on the expected sensitivity of these rates considering liquidity and the investment preferences of the Corporation. Non-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities are placed in a separate period. Capital is spread over time periods to reflect the Corporation s view of the maturity of these funds.  
     
  The following table presents the Corporation s interest rate sensitivity position or gap analysis as of September 30, 2016:   
 
   1   Loans include portfolio loans and loans held for sale   
     
  The table above indicates that the Corporation is asset-sensitive in the immediate to 90-day time frame and may experience an increase in net interest income during that time period if rates rise. Conversely, if rates decline, net interest income may decline. It should be noted that the gap analysis is only one tool used to measure interest rate sensitivity and should be used in conjunction with other measures such as the interest rate simulation discussed above. The gap analysis measures the timing of changes in rate, but not the true weighting of any specific component of the Corporation s balance sheet. The asset-sensitive position reflected in this gap analysis is similar to the Corporation s position at December 31, 2015.  

PROVISION FOR LOAN AND LEASE LOSSES      
       
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recorded a Provision of $1.4 million as compared to $1.2 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in Provision for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was partially related to the loan growth recorded in the third quarter of 2016, which totaled $69.5 million as well as the net charge-offs recognized in the third quarter of 2016 of $704 thousand. For the third quarter of 2015, loans increased $75.5 million and net charge-offs totaled $224 thousand.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Provision of $3.3 million was a $648 thousand increase from the same period in 2015. A considerable amount of the increase in 2016 was related to the strong loan growth during the first nine months of 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, portfolio loans increased by $224.4 million as compared to a $152.3 million for the same period in 2015, excluding the loans acquired in the January 1, 2015 Continental Merger.

Asset Quality and Analysis of Credit Risk      

As of September 30, 2016, total nonperforming loans and leases decreased by $361 thousand, to $9.9 million, representing 0.40% of portfolio loans and leases, as compared to $10.2 million, or 0.45% of portfolio loans and leases as of December 31, 2015. The decrease in nonperforming loans and leases resulted from pay-offs or pay-downs of $2.1 million of loans and leases, charge-offs of $313 thousand and the return to performing status of $256 thousand of loans and leases which had been nonperforming as of December 31, 2015. Partially offsetting the decreases in nonperforming loans from December 31, 2015 was the addition during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $2.8 million of new nonperforming loans and leases.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Allowance of $17.7 million represented 0.71% of portfolio loans and leases, as compared to $15.9 million, or 0.70% of portfolio loans as of December 31, 2015. The Allowance on originated portfolio loans, as a percentage of originated portfolio loans, was 0.81% as of September 30, 2016 as compared to 0.84% as of December 31, 2015. Loans acquired in mergers are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition. This fair value estimate takes into account an estimate of the expected lifetime losses of the acquired loans. As such, an acquired loan will not generally become subject to additional Allowance unless it becomes impaired.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had OREO valued at $867 thousand, as compared to $2.6 million as of December 31, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a $1.9 million OREO property acquired from a foreclosure during the fourth quarter of 2015 was sold, resulting in a loss on sale of $76 thousand. There were no sales of OREO during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The balance of OREO as of September 30, 2016 was comprised of six residential properties, five of which are manufactured housing properties acquired in the Continental Merger. All properties are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell.   
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had $8.0 million of troubled debt restructurings ( TDRs ), of which $6.3 million were in compliance with the modified terms and excluded from non-performing loans and leases. As of December 31, 2015, the Corporation had $6.8 million of TDRs, of which $4.9 million were in compliance with the modified terms, and were excluded from non-performing loans and leases.  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the Corporation had a recorded investment of $15.8 million of impaired loans and leases which included $8.0 million of TDRs. Impaired loans and leases are those for which it is probable that the Corporation will not be able to collect all scheduled principal and interest in accordance with the original terms of the loans and leases. Impaired loans and leases as of December 31, 2015 totaled $14.5 million, which included $6.8 million of TDRs. Refer to Note 5H in the Notes to unaudited consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding the Corporation s impaired loans and leases.   
     
  The Corporation continues to be diligent in its credit underwriting process and proactive with its loan review process, including the engagement of the services of an independent outside loan review firm, which helps identify developing credit issues. Proactive steps that are taken include the procurement of additional collateral (preferably outside the current loan structure) whenever possible and frequent contact with the borrower. The Corporation believes that timely identification of credit issues and appropriate actions early in the process serve to mitigate overall risk of loss.

NON-INTEREST INCOME      
       
   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Same Period in 2015   
     
  Non-interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $542 thousand as compared to the same period in 2015. Contributing to this increase was a $300 thousand increase in gain on sale of loans and a $397 thousand increase in other operating income, primarily related to the payoff, in full, of a purchased credit-impaired loan which had been recorded at a discount at acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases was a $179 thousand decrease in fees for wealth management services, much of which was the result of a shift in the composition of the portfolio, with more of the portfolio being comprised of assets held in lower-yielding fixed-fee accounts as of September 30, 2016, as compared to September 30, 2015 (see tables below).   
        
   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Same Period in 2015   
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income decreased $1.4 million as compared to the same period in 2015. The most significant contributors to this change were decreases of $959 thousand in gain on sale of available for sale investment securities, $536 in fees for wealth management services and $298 thousand in dividends on FHLB and FRB stock. The decrease in gain on sale of available for sale investment securities occurred because the $873 thousand gain on sale recognized during the first nine months of 2015, primarily related to the sale of available for sale investment securities acquired in the Continental Merger, was not repeated during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in fees for wealth management services was largely related to the shift in the wealth portfolio composition discussed in the previous paragraph. The decrease in dividends on FHLB and FRB stocks occurred because the special dividend of $448 thousand issued by FHLB in the first quarter of 2015 was not repeated in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by a $370 thousand increase in gain on sale of loans during the period.   
        
   Wealth Assets Under M  anagement,   A  dministration,   S  upervision and   B  rokerage   ( Wealth Assets )   
     
  Wealth Asset accounts are categorized into two groups; the first account group consists predominantly of clients whose fees are determined based on the market value of the assets held in their accounts ( Market Value  fee basis). The second account group consists predominantly of clients whose fees are set at fixed amounts ( Fixed Fee  basis), and, as such, are not affected by market value changes.

ON-INTEREST EXPENSE      
   Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Same Period in 2015   
     
  Non-interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $74 thousand, as compared to the same period in 2015. Increases in salaries and wages and other operating expenses of $680 thousand and $646 thousand, respectively, were partially offset by a decrease of $1.0 million in due diligence, merger-related and merger integration expenses. The increase in salaries and wages was related to annual salary increases, new staff additions, and increases in incentive compensation. The increase in other operating expenses was primarily related to a $576 thousand increase in the deferred compensation liability. This increase in the deferred compensation liability is largely offset by earnings associated with the deferred compensation trusts, which is included in miscellaneous other income in the table above.  

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Same Period in 2015   
     
  Non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $2.0 million from the same period in 2015, with the largest contributors to the decrease being the $4.8 million decrease in due diligence, merger-related and merger integration costs, a $627 thousand decrease in occupancy and bank premises, a $596 thousand decrease in employee benefits and an $802 thousand decrease in other operating expense detailed in the table below. The decrease in due diligence, merger-related and merger integration costs related to the costs associated with the Continental Merger, which wrapped up in the fourth quarter of 2015; the decrease in occupancy and bank premises expenses resulted from the branch and administrative office closures which occurred toward the end of 2015; and the decrease in employee benefits related to the settlement of the corporate pension plan, which occurred at the end of 2015. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $2.7 million in salaries and wages, $939 thousand in furniture, fixtures and equipment expense, $624 thousand in impairment of MSRs, and $654 thousand in Pennsylvania bank shares tax. The increase in salaries and wages was related to annual increases, the addition of two senior management positions and increases in incentive accruals. The increase in furniture, fixtures and equipment expense was related to infrastructure improvements which were largely completed in 2015 and placed into service in 2016. The increase in impairment of MSRs was primarily related to the impairment recorded in the second quarter of 2016, which occurred in connection with the market s outlook on the future of interest rates. The increase in Pennsylvania bank shares tax resulted from the January 1, 2015 Continental Merger. The effect of the increased equity resulting from the Continental Merger, on which the tax is based, was not experienced until 2016, since the tax for the current year is calculated on the prior year-end equity.

INCOME TAXES      
     
  Income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.3 million and $13.5 million, respectively, as compared to $4.1 million and $12.4 million for the same respective periods in 2015. The tax expense recorded reflects a decrease in the effective tax rate from 35.3% for the third quarter of 2015 to 31.2% for the third quarter of 2016. The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 was 35.0% and 33.6%, respectively. The primary driver for the decrease in tax rate for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the respective periods in 2015 was the early adoption of ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,  which changes the accounting for excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits stemming from the vesting or exercise of share-based awards were recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital in the equity section of the balance sheet. With the adoption of ASU 2016-09, these tax benefits are recognized through the income statement as an adjustment to tax expense. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Corporation recorded excess tax benefits of $385 thousand and $445 thousand, respectively.   The impact of the income tax benefit related to ASU 2016-09 is treated as a discrete item in the calculation of the year-to-date income tax expense.  
     
   BALANCE SHEET ANALYSIS   
     
  Total assets as of September 30, 2016 of $3.17 billion increased $143.1 million from $3.03 billion as of December 31, 2015.

Cash and Investment Securities     
     
  As of September 30, 2016, liquidity remained strong as the Corporation had $29.4 million of cash balances at the Federal Reserve and $681 thousand in other interest-bearing accounts, along with significant borrowing capacity as discussed in the  Liquidity  section below.  
     
  Investment securities available for sale as of September 30, 2016 totaled $366.9 million, as compared to $349.0 million as of December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to a $47.8 million increase in mortgage-related securities, partially offset by decreases of $24.9 million in U.S. government agency securities and $4.7 million in municipal obligations.

  Deposits and borrowings as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows:  

Capital    
     
  Consolidated shareholder s equity of the Corporation was $378.5 million, or 11.9% of total assets as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $365.7 million, or 12.1% of total assets as of December 31, 2015.

Both the Corporation and the Bank exceed the capital levels to be considered  well capitalized  that are required by their respective regulators at the end of each period presented. The capital ratios as of September 30, 2016 for the Corporation have decreased from their December 31, 2015 levels, primarily as a result of the increase in risk-weighted assets during the first nine months of 2016. The loan growth during the first nine months of 2016 accounted for the majority of the risk-weighted asset growth, as cash balances that were present as of December 31, 2015, which were risk-weighted at zero percent, were replaced largely by loans which are risk-weighted between 50% and 100%. In addition, the Corporation repurchased $8.1 million of treasury stock and issued dividends of $10.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, further reducing capital. These reductions were partially offset by the $26.6 million increase in retained earnings from net income for the first nine months of 2016. The capital levels of the Bank, which were affected by the same factors which reduced the Corporation s capital levels, were increased as a result of the $15 million downstream of capital from the Corporation, which occurred during the first quarter of 2016. Neither the Corporation nor the Bank is under any agreement with regulatory authorities which would have a material effect on liquidity, capital resources or operations of the Corporation or the Bank.   
     
   Liquidity    
     
  The Corporation s liquidity position is managed on a daily basis as part of the daily settlement function and continuously as part of the formal asset liability management process. The Bank s liquidity is maintained by managing its core deposits as the primary source, purchasing federal funds, selling loans in the secondary market, borrowing from the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank, and purchasing and issuing wholesale certificates of deposit as its secondary sources.   
     
  Unused availability is detailed on the following table:    

Quarterly, the ALCO reviews the Corporation s liquidity needs and reports its findings to the Risk Management Committee of the Corporation s Board of Directors.   
     
  The Corporation has an agreement with CDC to provide up to $5 million, excluding accrued interest, of money market deposits at an agreed upon rate currently at 0.45%. The Corporation had $538 thousand in balances, including accrued interest, as of September 30, 2016 under this program. The Corporation can request an increase in the agreement amount as it deems necessary. In addition, the Corporation has an agreement with IND to provide up to $40 million, excluding accrued interest, of money market and NOW funds at an agreed upon interest rate equal to the current Fed Funds rate plus 20 basis points. The Corporation had $38.3 million in balances as of September 30, 2016 under this program.   
     
  The Corporation continually evaluates the cost and mix of its retail and wholesale funding sources relative to earning assets and expected future earning-asset growth. The Corporation believes that with its current branch network, along with the available borrowing capacity at FHLB and other sources, it has sufficient capacity available to fund expected earning-asset growth.  
     
   Discussion of Segments    
     
  The Corporation has two principal segments as defined by FASB ASC 280,   Segment Reporting.   The segments are Banking and Wealth Management (see Note 10 in the accompanying Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements).   
     
  The Wealth Management Segment, as discussed in the Non-Interest Income section above, recorded a pre-tax segment profit ( PTSP ) of $3.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to PTSP of $4.0 million for the same period in 2015. The Wealth Management Segment provided 27.3% of the Corporation s pre-tax profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 34.9% for the same period in 2015. The $267 thousand decrease in revenue for the segment largely accounted for the decrease in percentage of pre-tax profit contributed.  
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Wealth Management Segment recorded a PTSP of $10.8 million, as compared to $12.3 million for the same period in 2015. As a percentage of consolidated PTSP, the Wealth Management Segment provided 26.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 34.6% for the same period in 2015. The primary driver for the decrease was related to operating expense increases of $1.1 million.   
     
  The Banking Segment recorded a PTSP of $10.0 million and $29.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to PTSP of $7.5 million and $23.3 million for the same respective periods in 2015. The Banking Segment provided 72.7% and 73.1% of the Corporation s pre-tax profit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, as compared to 65.1% and 65.4% for the same respective periods in 2015.

Off Balance Sheet Risk    
     
  The Corporation is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.   
     
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the loan agreement. Total commitments to extend credit at September 30, 2016 were $651.9 million, as compared to $634.2 million at December 31, 2015.   
     
  Standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Bank to a customer for a third party. Such standby letters of credit are issued to support private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing standby letters of credit is similar to that involved in granting loan facilities to customers. The Bank s obligation under standby letters of credit at September 30, 2016 amounted to $15.0 million, as compared to $14.6 million at December 31, 2015.   
     
  Estimated fair values of the Corporation s off-balance sheet instruments are based on fees and rates currently charged to enter into similar loan agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties  credit standing. Since fees and rates charged for off-balance sheet items are at market levels when set, there is no material difference between the stated amount and the estimated fair value of off-balance sheet instruments.

Other Information      
     
   Effects of Inflation      
     
  Inflation has some impact on the Corporation s operating costs. Unlike many industrial companies, however, substantially all of the Corporation s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on the Corporation s performance than the general level of inflation. Over short periods of time, interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as prices of goods and services.   
     
   Effects of Government Monetary Policies    
     
  The earnings of the Corporation are and will be affected by domestic economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and interest rates. Among the instruments used to implement those objectives are open market operations in United States government securities and changes in reserve requirements against member bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments, and deposits, and their use may also affect rates charged on loans or paid for deposits.   
     
  The Corporation is a member of the Federal Reserve System and, therefore, the policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have a significant effect on its deposits, loans and investment growth, as well as the rate of interest earned and paid, and are expected to affect the Corporation s operations in the future. The effect of such policies and regulations upon the future business and earnings of the Corporation cannot be predicted.

  On November 2, 2016, the Bank entered into its standard form of Executive Change-of-Control Severance Agreement (the  Agreement ) with Harry R. Madeira, Executive Vice President and head of the Bank s Wealth Management Division. The Agreement provides for Mr. Madeira to receive certain severance payments and benefits if he is subject to a Termination upon Change of Control, as described below and more fully defined in the Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement, a Termination upon Change of Control will occur in the event that Mr. Madeira is subject to, within two (2) years after a Change of Control, a Separation from Service that is either (i) initiated by the Bank for any reason other than Mr. Madeira s continuous illness, injury or incapacity for a period of six consecutive months or for  cause,  as defined therein, or (ii) initiated by Mr. Madeira following (a) a significant reduction of his authority, duties or responsibilities; (b) any removal from his position as an officer of the Corporation, the Bank or its subsidiaries; (c) any reduction in his Base Salary, as defined; (d) any revocation or modification of the AIP (annual incentive plan as more fully described in the Agreement) or Stock Plan, as defined therein, or any action taken pursuant to the terms of either plan, which, subject to certain limitations, materially (x) reduces Mr. Madeira s compensation thereunder, or (y) increases the compensation payable to other participants but not to Mr. Madeira; (e) a transfer of Mr. Madeira to a location outside of Bryn Mawr, PA, the general area of Mr. Madeira s principal place of business, or reasonable commuting distance; (f) any substantial increase in Mr. Madeira s business travel requirements; or (g) the failure of the Bank to require any successor of the Bank or the Corporation to become jointly and severally obligated with the Bank to perform the Agreement.   
     
  In the event of such a Termination upon Change of Control, the Bank or any successor thereto, will be obligated to pay to Mr. Madeira (i) cash equal to three (3) times Mr. Madeira s Base Salary in effect either immediately prior to the Separation from Service or immediately prior to the Change of Control, whichever is higher; (ii) in relation to Mr. Madeira s outstanding and unexercised stock options, whether vested or unvested, any excess amount of the aggregate fair market value of the Corporation s shares underlying such stock options over the aggregate exercise price of such stock options; (iii) the cash value of any unused vacation pay; and (iv) all awards and payments earned by Mr. Madeira under any annual incentive plan, both in respect of complete plan periods any incomplete fiscal year periods, prior to the Termination Date, as defined therein. For a period of thirty-six months after the Termination Date, the Bank must also provide medical, dental, life and disability insurance benefits, and payment for reasonable career counseling services. Mr. Madeira is not required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in the Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise.   
     
  To the extent that the payments made pursuant to the Agreement, when aggregated with all other payments made to Mr. Madeira by the Bank or the Corporation, will be deemed an  excess parachute payment  in accordance with Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and be subject to the excise tax provided under Section 4999 thereof, all sums payable under the Agreement will be reduced in such manner and to such extent so that no  excess parachute payment  shall be made. In the event that a reduction of payment is necessary, Mr. Madeira in his sole discretion shall determine which and how much of the payments to be made under the Agreement shall be eliminated or reduced.   
     
  The term of the Agreement is initially three (3) years to be automatically extended for additional one-year periods unless at least one year s written notice of termination is provided to Mr. Madeira by the Bank, provided that (i) after a Change of Control during the term of the Agreement, the Agreement is to remain in effect for a period of two (2) years and until all of the obligations of the parties thereunder are satisfied or have expired, and (ii) the Agreement terminates automatically if, prior to the Change of Control, Mr. Madeira s employment with the Bank or any of its subsidiaries terminates for any reason.   
     
  The foregoing summary of the Agreement is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of the Agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.4 of this Form 10-Q and incorporated herein by reference.

THE BRYN MAWR TRUST COMPANY   
     
   EXECUTIVE CHANGE-OF-CONTROL   
     
   SEVERANCE AGREEMENT   
     
  This Agreement made as of August 1, 2016 between The Bryn Mawr Trust Company, a Pennsylvania financial institution, subject to the provisions of the Pennsylvania Banking Code of 1965, as amended (the  Company ), and Denise Rinear (the  Employee ).  
     
  WHEREAS, the Employee has been offered employment and will be employed by the Company as its Executive Vice President   Chief Risk Officer beginning August 1, 2016;  
     
  WHEREAS, the Company considers it essential to foster the employment of well qualified key management personnel, and, in this regard, the board of directors of the Company recognizes that, as is the case with many financial institutions, the possibility of a change of control of the Company s publicly held parent company, Bryn Mawr Bank Corporation, ( BMBC ) may exist and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among the Company s management, may result in the departure or distraction of key management personnel to the detriment of the Company and ultimately to the detriment of BMBC and its shareholders;  
     
  WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and BMBC have determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of key members of the Company s management to their assigned duties, without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change of control of the BMBC, although no such change is now contemplated; and  
     
  WHEREAS, in order to induce the Employee, who will be a key member of the Company s management, to become an employee of the Company, the Company agrees that the Employee shall receive the compensation and benefits set forth in this Agreement in the event his/her employment with the Company is terminated subsequent to a  Change of Control  (as defined in Section 1 hereof) of BMBC, as a cushion against the financial and career impact on the Employee of any such Change of Control;  
     
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows:  
     
  1.  Definitions . For all purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings specified in this Section, unless the context clearly otherwise requires:

  (b)  AIP  shall mean any Annual Incentive Plan of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to a Change of Control, or predecessor or prior plan, including the Company s annual bonus plan applicable to Employee  .

  (d) Payments or reimbursements pursuant to subsection (b) and (d) of this Section 4 shall be subject to the following conditions:  
     
  (i) Payments shall be made on a calendar year basis;  
     
  (ii) Amounts payable with respect to a calendar year shall not affect amounts payable with respect to another calendar year; and  
     
  (iii) Payments with respect to expenses incurred must be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which they were incurred.  
     
  4A.  Six (6) Month Delay in Payments.

  5.  Establishment of Trust . Immediately upon a Change of Control as herein defined, the Company shall establish an irrevocable trust fund pursuant to a trust agreement to hold assets to satisfy its obligations hereunder.

  6.  Enforcement   .  
     
  (a) In the event that the Company shall fail or refuse to make payment of any amounts due the Employee under Sections 3 and 4 hereof within the respective time periods provided therein, the Company shall pay to the Employee, in addition to the payment of any other sums provided in this Agreement, interest, compounded daily, on any amount remaining unpaid from the date payment is required under Section 3, 4 or 5, as appropriate, until paid to the Employee, at the prime rate published daily in the Wall Street Journal, each change in such rate to take effect on the effective date of the change in such prime rate.  
     
  (b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Employee not be required to incur any expenses associated with the enforcement of his/her rights under this Agreement by arbitration, litigation or other legal action because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Employee hereunder. Accordingly, the Company shall pay the Employee on demand the amount necessary to reimburse the Employee in full for all expenses (including all attorneys  fees and legal expenses) incurred by the Employee in enforcing any of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.  
     
  7.  No Mitigation . The Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise.  
     
  8.  Nonexclusivity of Rights . Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Employee s continuing or future participation in or rights under any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided by BMBC, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and for which the Employee may qualify;    provided, however,  that if the Employee becomes entitled to and receives all of the payments provided for in this Agreement, the Employee agrees to waive his/her right to receive payments under any severance plan or program applicable to all employees of the Company.    

9.  No Set-Off . The Company s obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company may have against the Employee or others and the Company hereby agrees not to exercise any such rights with respect to payment due the Employee pursuant to this Agreement.  
     
  10.  Certain Reduction of Payments   .  
     
  (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that it shall be determined as set forth herein that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (a  Payment ), would constitute an  excess parachute payment  within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), and that it would be economically advantageous to the Employee to reduce the Payment to avoid or reduce the taxation of excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Code, the aggregate present value of amounts payable or distributable to or for the benefit of the Employee pursuant to this Agreement (such payments or distributions pursuant to this Agreement are hereinafter referred to as  Agreement Payments ) shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Reduced Amount. The  Reduced Amount  shall be an amount expressed in present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of Agreement Payments without causing any Payment to be subject to the taxation under Section 4999 of the Code. For purposes of this Section 10, present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code.  
     
  (b) All determinations to be made under this Section 10 shall be made, in writing, by KPMG LLP, or the Company s independent certified public accountant immediately prior to the Change of Control, if other than KPMG LLP, (the  Accounting Firm ), which firm shall provide its determinations and any supporting calculations in writing to both the Company and the Employee within ten (10) days of the Termination Date. Any such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Employee. The Employee shall in his or her sole discretion determine which and how much of the Agreement Payments shall be eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of this Section 10, which determination shall be made by delivery of written notice to the Company within 10 days of Employee s receipt of the determination of the Accounting Firm. Within five (5) days after the Employee s timely determination, the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) or distribute (or cause to be distributed) to or for the benefit of the Employee, such amounts as are then due to the Employee under this Agreement. In the event Employee does not make such timely determination then within 15 days after Company s receipt of the determination of the Accounting Firm, the Company in its sole discretion may pay (or cause to be paid) or distribute (or cause to be distributed) to or for the benefit of the Employee such portion of the Agreement Payments as it may deem appropriate, but no less than the Reduced Amount.  
     
  (c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 280G of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Agreement Payments, as the case may be, will have been made by the Company which should not have been made ( Overpayment ) or that additional Agreement Payments which have not been made by the Company could have been made ( Underpayment ), in each case, consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. Within two (2) years after the Separation from Service, the Accounting Firm shall review the determination made by it pursuant to the preceding paragraph. In the event that the Accounting Firm determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Employee which the Employee shall repay to the Company together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code (the  Federal Rate     provided, however,  that no amount shall be payable by the Employee to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not reduce the amount which is subject to taxation under Section 4999 of the Code. In the event that the Accounting Firm determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee together with interest thereon at the Federal Rate.    

(d) All of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in performing the determinations referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall be borne solely by the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Accounting Firm of and from any and all claims, damages and expenses of any nature resulting from or relating to its determinations pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) above, except for claims, damages or expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Accounting Firm.  
     
  11.  Settlement of All Disputes   .  
     
  (a) The Employee and the Company acknowledge that the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board intends to review and approve a schedule indicating a method of calculating certain payments to be made to the Employee hereunder in the event of a Termination upon a Change of Control. In the event that the compensation plans referred to herein change prior to a Change of Control, the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board may, prior to such Change of Control, revise the schedule to reflect such changes. The method of calculation set forth on such schedule, as so revised prior to a Change of Control, shall be followed by the parties hereto unless manifestly unfair to the Employee.  
     
  (b) In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any provision of this Agreement or the Employee s Termination upon a Change of Control, the Company shall appoint as the sole and exclusive arbiter of such dispute, controversy or claim, a committee composed of two persons who were members of the Company s Board at any time within five (5) years prior to the Change of Control (which persons may, but need not be, directors of the Company at the time of such dispute, controversy or claim);  provided  ,  however  , that no person shall be eligible to serve thereon who (i) is at the Termination Date, or shall have been at any time within one year prior thereto, an executive officer of the Company, or (ii) shall be or have been at any time related in any manner to or otherwise affiliated with, or was first nominated by, the corporation, Person or group whose acquisition of shares of Common Stock of BMBC has given rise to a Change of Control. The decision of such committee and the award of any monetary judgment or other relief by such committee shall be final and binding upon the Employee and the Company, and shall not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the decision and award of such committee by the Employee or the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Company shall pay the persons selected pursuant to this subsection a reasonable fee for their services, and shall reimburse such persons for their expenses incurred in this capacity. In addition, the Company shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless such persons of and from any and all claims, damages or expenses of any nature whatsoever relating to or arising from their activities in this capacity.    

(c) In the event that the Company shall be unable to appoint the committee referred to in paragraph (b) above after good faith efforts to do so, or in the event that such committee cannot reach a unanimous agreement, any remaining dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any provision of this Agreement or the Employee s Termination upon a Change of Control shall be settled by arbitration in the City of Philadelphia, in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association, before a panel of three (3) arbitrators, two (2) of whom shall be selected by the Company and the Employee, respectively, and the third of whom shall be selected by the other two arbitrators. Each arbitrator selected as provided herein is required to be or have been a director or an executive officer of a corporation whose shares of common stock were listed during at least one year of such service on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System. Any award entered by the arbitrators shall be entered thereon by any party in accordance with applicable law in any court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall be specifically enforceable. The fees of the American Arbitration Association and the arbitrators and any expenses relating to the conduct of the arbitration shall be paid by the Company.  
     
  (d) The party or parties challenging the right of the Employee to the benefits of this Agreement shall in all circumstances have the burden of proof.  
     
  12.  Term of Agreement . The term of this Agreement shall be for three (3) years from the date hereof and shall automatically be extended for additional one-year periods unless written notice of termination of this Agreement is provided to the Employee by the Company at least one year prior to the expiration of the initial three (3) year term or any one-year renewal period;    provided, however,  that (i) after a Change of Control during the term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of two (2) years and until all of the obligations of the parties hereunder are satisfied or have expired, and (ii) this Agreement shall terminate if, prior to the Change of Control, the employment of the Employee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate for any reason whatsoever.  
     
  13.  Successor Company . The Company shall require any Person who acquires the majority of the Common Stock of the Company or BMBC or any successor or successors thereof (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company or BMBC, by agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Employee, to acknowledge expressly, in writing, that this Agreement is binding upon and enforceable against the Company or BMBC or any successor or successors thereto in accordance with the terms hereof and the instrument of transfer, and to become jointly and severally obligated with the Company to perform this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform this Agreement if no such acquisition purchaser, merger consolidation, succession or successions had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the Company shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any such successor or successors to its business and/or assets, jointly and severally.

All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder or necessary or convenient in connection herewith shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by overnight express courier service, as follows:

1.     Restrictive Covenants    

A.      
 
   Definitions         
     
  As used in this Agreement, the term   Restricted Period   shall mean a period commencing on the date hereof and continuing for twenty four (24) months after termination of Employee s employment with Company; the term   Business   shall mean any business in which any member of the Company Group is engaged at any time during Employee s employment with Company and also encompasses any field in which any member of the Company Group is engaged in research and/or development at any time during Employee s employment with Company; and the term   Company Group   shall mean (i) collectively, Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates and (ii) where applicable, individually, Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.    

B.    
 
   Confidentiality       
     
  (i)             Employee recognizes and acknowledges that the Proprietary Information is a valuable, special and unique asset of the Company Group. As a result, Employee shall not, without the prior written consent of Company, for any reason, either directly or indirectly, divulge to any third-party or use for his or her own benefit, or for any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of the Company Group, any confidential or proprietary business or technical information of the Company Group or any knowledge, data or information of the Company Group which is defined as a trade secret under applicable law (collectively   Proprietary Information  ). Such Proprietary Information shall include, but shall not be limited to, any information relating to formulae, technology, know-how, methods, contracts, pricing lists, costs, policies, sales methods, financial condition, operations, statistics, business partners, marketing data, methods, plans and efforts, customers, customer requirements, prospective customers and any other information relating to the Company Group that has not been made available to the general public. Proprietary Information shall not include information or data that is readily available to the general public so long as such information did not become available to the general public as a direct or indirect result of Employee s breach of his or her obligations under this Agreement. Failure to mark any of the Proprietary Information as confidential or proprietary shall not affect its status as Proprietary Information under the terms of this Agreement.  
     
  (ii)            Employee shall exercise his or her best efforts to ensure the continued confidentiality of all Proprietary Information of the Company Group known by, disclosed to or made available to Employee, whether in connection with this Agreement or any other past or present relationship with the Company Group. Employee shall immediately notify Company of any unauthorized disclosure or use of any Proprietary Information of which Employee becomes aware. Employee shall assist the Company Group to the extent necessary, both during the term of his or her employment with Company and thereafter, in the procurement or any protection of the Company Group s rights to or in any of the Proprietary Information in any and all countries, including disclosure to the Company Group of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications, oaths, assignments and all other instruments which the Company Group deems necessary in order to apply for and obtain such rights and in order to assign and convey to the Company Group and its successors, assigns, and nominees the sole and exclusive rights, title and interest in and to such Proprietary Information, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto. Nothing herein, however, shall restrict Employee s ability to disclose Proprietary Information during the course of his or her employment with Company as may be necessary or appropriate to the effective and efficient discharge of his or her duties solely on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Company Group or as such disclosure may be required by law.  
     
  (iii)           At any time upon the specific request of Company, Employee shall return to Company all written or descriptive materials of any kind, in any medium (including all copies thereof), in the possession or control of Employee which constitute, contain or relate to any Proprietary Information.   

C.    
 
   Non-Solicitation       
     
  Employee shall not, during the Restricted Period, directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of Company:  
     
  (i)             solicit or call on, directly or indirectly, on Employee s own behalf or on behalf of any person or entity other than the Company Group, any customer or prospective customer of the Company Group or any person or entity that was a customer of the Company Group at any time within two (2) years prior to the termination of Employee s employment with Company for the purpose of engaging in any business then engaged in by the Company Group;    

2

(ii)            influence or attempt to influence any person or entity engaged in business with the Company Group to terminate or modify any written or oral agreement or course of dealing with the Company Group; or  
     
  (iii)           influence or attempt to influence any person who is then employed or retained by the Company Group as an employee, officer, director, consultant or agent or has served in any such capacity on behalf of the Company Group within two (2) years prior to the time of the solicitation to terminate or modify his or her employment, consulting, agency or other arrangement with the Company Group, or employ or retain, or arrange to have any other person or entity employ or retain, any such current or former Company Group employee, officer, director, consultant or agent.  

D.    
 
   Non-Disparagement       
     
  During Employee s term of employment and thereafter, Employee agrees to take no action which is intended, or would reasonably be expected, to harm the Company Group, its employees, directors or officers, or its or their reputation or which would reasonably be expected to lead to unwanted or unfavorable publicity about the Company Group or such individuals.  

E.    
 
   No Conflicts       
     
  Employee represents and warrants that he or she is not a party to or bound by any agreement, arrangement or understanding, whether written or otherwise, which prohibits or in any manner restricts his or her ability to enter into and fulfill his or her obligations under this Agreement and/or which would in any manner, directly or indirectly, limit or affect the duties and responsibilities which may now or in the future be assigned to Employee, and Employee agrees he or she will not enter into, any oral or written agreement in conflict herewith. Employee will indemnify and hold harmless the Company Group and its and their successors and assigns from any claims, liabilities, damages, costs and expenses (including legal fees) resulting from third-party claims of any such conflict or breach.  

F.    
 
   Remedies       
     
  Employee acknowledges that the Company Group is and will be engaged in highly competitive businesses and that the Proprietary Information, as well as its respective business techniques and programs, are of great significance in enabling it to compete and participate in the various markets in which it is active. Employee further acknowledges that the Company Group does conduct business on a global basis, and that its products and services are or will be distributed throughout the entire world. Employee acknowledges and agrees that the restrictions contained in this Agreement are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the legitimate interests of the Company Group and that any violation thereof would result in irreparable injury to the Company Group. Consequently, Employee acknowledges and agrees that, in the event of any violation thereof, the Company Group shall be authorized and entitled to obtain from any court of competent jurisdiction injunctive and equitable relief, including, without limitation, specific performance, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, permanent injunction or other interim or conservative relief, as well as an equitable accounting of all profits and benefits arising out of such violation, which rights and remedies shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the Company Group may be entitled at law or in equity and, in the event the Company Group is required to enforce the terms of this Agreement through court proceedings, the Company Group shall be entitled to reimbursement of all legal fees, costs and expenses incident to enforcement of any such term, in whole or in part and/or such term as may be modified by a court of competent jurisdiction. Employee will not seek, and waives any requirement for, the securing or posting of a bond or proving actual damages in connection with the Company Group s or its or their successors or assigns seeking or obtaining injunctive or equitable relief in connection with Employee s covenants or other obligations under this Agreement. If, despite the foregoing waivers, a court would nonetheless require the posting of a bond, the parties agree that a bond in the amount of $1,000 would be a fair and reasonable amount, particularly in light of the difficulty in quantifying what would be the actual loss caused by an injunction.

G.    
 
   Scope; Tolling       
     
  If any court of competent jurisdiction construes any of the restrictive covenants set forth in this Agreement, or any part thereof, to be unenforceable because of the duration, scope or geographic area covered thereby, such court shall have the power to reduce the duration, scope or geographic area of such provision and, in its reduced form, such provision shall then be enforceable and shall be enforced. In the event of any breach or violation of a restriction contained in this Agreement, the period therein specified shall abate during the time of such violation, and that portion shall not begin to run until such violation has been fully and finally cured.

  WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of the Company and BMBC have determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of key members of the Company s management to their assigned duties, without distraction in the face of potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change of control of BMBC, although no such change is now contemplated; and  
     
  WHEREAS, in order to induce the Employee, who is a key member of the Company s management, to continue as an employee of the Company, the Company agrees that the Employee shall receive the compensation and benefits set forth in this Agreement in the event his/her employment with the Company is terminated subsequent to a  Change of Control  (as defined in Section 1 hereof) of BMBC, as a cushion against the financial and career impact on the Employee of any such Change of Control;

(c) pay for reasonable career counseling services provided by Kelleher Associates, LLC or any such equivalent agency satisfactory to both the Company and the Employee payable in the same amounts and on the same schedule as in effect, immediately prior to the Change of Control, and payable for no more than thirty six (36) whole months after the Termination Date.  
     
  (d) Payments or reimbursements pursuant to subsection (b) and (d) of this Section 4 shall be subject to the following conditions:  
     
  (i) Payments shall be made on a calendar year basis;  
     
  (ii) Amounts payable with respect to a calendar year shall not affect amounts payable with respect to another calendar year; and  
     
  (iii) Payments with respect to expenses incurred must be made no later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar year in which they were incurred.  
     
  4A.  Six (6) Month Delay in Payments.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if the Employee is a Specified Employee on the date of his Separation From Service, then in no event shall any amount payable to him or her be paid before the date that is six months after the date of such Separation From Service  .  
     
  5.  Establishment of Trust . Immediately upon a Change of Control as herein defined, the Company shall establish an irrevocable trust fund pursuant to a trust agreement to hold assets to satisfy its obligations hereunder. Funding of such trust fund shall be subject to the Company s discretion, as to be set forth in the agreement pursuant to which the trust fund will be established.  
     
  6.  Enforcement   .  
     
  (a) In the event that the Company shall fail or refuse to make payment of any amounts due the Employee under Sections 3 and 4 hereof within the respective time periods provided therein, the Company shall pay to the Employee, in addition to the payment of any other sums provided in this Agreement, interest, compounded daily, on any amount remaining unpaid from the date payment is required under Section 3, 4 or 5, as appropriate, until paid to the Employee, at the prime rate published daily in the Wall Street Journal, each change in such rate to take effect on the effective date of the change in such prime rate.  
     
  (b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Employee not be required to incur any expenses associated with the enforcement of his/her rights under this Agreement by arbitration, litigation or other legal action because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to the Employee hereunder. Accordingly, the Company shall pay the Employee on demand the amount necessary to reimburse the Employee in full for all expenses (including all attorneys  fees and legal expenses) incurred by the Employee in enforcing any of the obligations of the Company under this Agreement.  
     
  7.  No Mitigation . The Employee shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise.  
     
  8.  Nonexclusivity of Rights . Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or limit the Employee s continuing or future participation in or rights under any benefit, bonus, incentive or other plan or program provided by BMBC, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and for which the Employee may qualify;    provided, however,  that if the Employee becomes entitled to and receives all of the payments provided for in this Agreement, the Employee agrees to waive his/her right to receive payments under any severance plan or program applicable to all employees of the Company.    

9.  No Set-Off . The Company s obligation to make the payments provided for in this Agreement and otherwise to perform its obligations hereunder shall not be affected by any circumstances, including, without limitation, any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company may have against the Employee or others and the Company hereby agrees not to exercise any such rights with respect to payment due the Employee pursuant to this Agreement.  
     
  10.  Certain Reduction of Payments   .  
     
  (a) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that it shall be determined as set forth herein that any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise (a  Payment ), would constitute an  excess parachute payment  within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), and that it would be economically advantageous to the Employee to reduce the Payment to avoid or reduce the taxation of excess parachute payments under Section 4999 of the Code, the aggregate present value of amounts payable or distributable to or for the benefit of the Employee pursuant to this Agreement (such payments or distributions pursuant to this Agreement are hereinafter referred to as  Agreement Payments ) shall be reduced (but not below zero) to the Reduced Amount. The  Reduced Amount  shall be an amount expressed in present value which maximizes the aggregate present value of Agreement Payments without causing any Payment to be subject to the taxation under Section 4999 of the Code. For purposes of this Section 10, present value shall be determined in accordance with Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code.  
     
  (b) All determinations to be made under this Section 10 shall be made, in writing, by KPMG LLP, or the Company s independent certified public accountant immediately prior to the Change of Control, if other than KPMG LLP, (the  Accounting Firm ), which firm shall provide its determinations and any supporting calculations in writing to both the Company and the Employee within ten (10) days of the Termination Date. Any such determination by the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon the Company and the Employee. The Employee shall in his or her sole discretion determine which and how much of the Agreement Payments shall be eliminated or reduced consistent with the requirements of this Section 10, which determination shall be made by delivery of written notice to the Company within 10 days of Employee s receipt of the determination of the Accounting Firm. Within five (5) days after the Employee s timely determination, the Company shall pay (or cause to be paid) or distribute (or cause to be distributed) to or for the benefit of the Employee, such amounts as are then due to the Employee under this Agreement. In the event Employee does not make such timely determination then within 15 days after Company s receipt of the determination of the Accounting Firm, the Company in its sole discretion may pay (or cause to be paid) or distribute (or cause to be distributed) to or for the benefit of the Employee such portion of the Agreement Payments as it may deem appropriate, but no less than the Reduced Amount.    

(c) As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 280G of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Accounting Firm hereunder, it is possible that Agreement Payments, as the case may be, will have been made by the Company which should not have been made ( Overpayment ) or that additional Agreement Payments which have not been made by the Company could have been made ( Underpayment ), in each case, consistent with the calculations required to be made hereunder. Within two (2) years after the Separation from Service, the Accounting Firm shall review the determination made by it pursuant to the preceding paragraph. In the event that the Accounting Firm determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment shall be treated for all purposes as a loan to the Employee which the Employee shall repay to the Company together with interest at the applicable Federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code (the  Federal Rate     provided, however,  that no amount shall be payable by the Employee to the Company if and to the extent such payment would not reduce the amount which is subject to taxation under Section 4999 of the Code. In the event that the Accounting Firm determines that an Underpayment has occurred, any such Underpayment shall be promptly paid by the Company to or for the benefit of the Employee together with interest thereon at the Federal Rate.  
     
  (d) All of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm in performing the determinations referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c) above shall be borne solely by the Company. The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Accounting Firm of and from any and all claims, damages and expenses of any nature resulting from or relating to its determinations pursuant to paragraphs (b) and (c) above, except for claims, damages or expenses resulting from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Accounting Firm.  
     
  11.  Settlement of All Disputes   .  
     
  (a) The Employee and the Company acknowledge that the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board intends to review and approve a schedule indicating a method of calculating certain payments to be made to the Employee hereunder in the event of a Termination upon a Change of Control. In the event that the compensation plans referred to herein change prior to a Change of Control, the Compensation Committee of the Company s Board may, prior to such Change of Control, revise the schedule to reflect such changes. The method of calculation set forth on such schedule, as so revised prior to a Change of Control, shall be followed by the parties hereto unless manifestly unfair to the Employee.  
     
  (b) In the event of any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any provision of this Agreement or the Employee s Termination upon a Change of Control, the Company shall appoint as the sole and exclusive arbiter of such dispute, controversy or claim, a committee composed of two persons who were members of the Company s Board at any time within five (5) years prior to the Change of Control (which persons may, but need not be, directors of the Company at the time of such dispute, controversy or claim);  provided  ,  however , that no person shall be eligible to serve thereon who (i) is at the Termination Date, or shall have been at any time within one year prior thereto, an executive officer of the Company, or (ii) shall be or have been at any time related in any manner to or otherwise affiliated with, or was first nominated by, the corporation, Person or group whose acquisition of shares of Common Stock of BMBC has given rise to a Change of Control. The decision of such committee and the award of any monetary judgment or other relief by such committee shall be final and binding upon the Employee and the Company, and shall not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the decision and award of such committee by the Employee or the Company in any court of competent jurisdiction. The Company shall pay the persons selected pursuant to this subsection a reasonable fee for their services, and shall reimburse such persons for their expenses incurred in this capacity. In addition, the Company shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, indemnify and hold harmless such persons of and from any and all claims, damages or expenses of any nature whatsoever relating to or arising from their activities in this capacity.    

(c) In the event that the Company shall be unable to appoint the committee referred to in paragraph (b) above after good faith efforts to do so, or in the event that such committee cannot reach a unanimous agreement, any remaining dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or relating to any provision of this Agreement or the Employee s Termination upon a Change of Control shall be settled by arbitration in the City of Philadelphia, in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules then in effect of the American Arbitration Association, before a panel of three (3) arbitrators, two (2) of whom shall be selected by the Company and the Employee, respectively, and the third of whom shall be selected by the other two arbitrators. Each arbitrator selected as provided herein is required to be or have been a director or an executive officer of a corporation whose shares of common stock were listed during at least one year of such service on the New York Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange or quoted on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System. Any award entered by the arbitrators shall be entered thereon by any party in accordance with applicable law in any court of competent jurisdiction. This arbitration provision shall be specifically enforceable. The fees of the American Arbitration Association and the arbitrators and any expenses relating to the conduct of the arbitration shall be paid by the Company.  
     
  (d) The party or parties challenging the right of the Employee to the benefits of this Agreement shall in all circumstances have the burden of proof.  
     
  12.  Term of Agreement . The term of this Agreement shall be for three (3) years from the date hereof and shall automatically be extended for additional one-year periods unless written notice of termination of this Agreement is provided to the Employee by the Company at least one year prior to the expiration of the initial three (3) year term or any one-year renewal period;    provided, however,  that (i) after a Change of Control during the term of this Agreement, this Agreement shall remain in effect for a period of two (2) years and until all of the obligations of the parties hereunder are satisfied or have expired, and (ii) this Agreement shall terminate if, prior to the Change of Control, the employment of the Employee with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall terminate for any reason whatsoever.  
     
  13.  Successor Company . The Company shall require any Person who acquires the majority of the Common Stock of the Company or BMBC or any successor or successors thereof (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company or BMBC, by agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Employee, to acknowledge expressly, in writing, that this Agreement is binding upon and enforceable against the Company or BMBC or any successor or successors thereto in accordance with the terms hereof and the instrument of transfer, and to become jointly and severally obligated with the Company to perform this Agreement, in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform this Agreement if no such acquisition purchaser, merger consolidation, succession or successions had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a breach of this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the Company shall mean the Company as hereinbefore defined and any such successor or successors to its business and/or assets, jointly and severally.    

14.  Notice . All notices and other communications required or permitted hereunder or necessary or convenient in connection herewith shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally or mailed by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, or by overnight express courier service, as follows:

  16.  Contents of Agreement, Amendment and Assignment   .  
     
  (a) This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding between the parties hereto and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement cannot be changed, modified, extended or terminated except upon written amendment executed by the Employee and approved by the Board and executed on the Company s behalf by a duly authorized officer. The provisions of this Agreement may provide for payments to the Employee under certain compensation or bonus plans (including without limitation the AIP and Stock Plan) under circumstances where such plans would not provide for payment thereof. It is the specific intention of the parties that the provisions of this Agreement shall supersede any provisions to the contrary in such plans, and such plans shall be deemed to have been amended to correspond with this Agreement without further action by the Company or the Boards of BMBC or the Company.  
     
  (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving the Employee any right to be retained in the employ of the Company.    

(c) The Employee acknowledges that from time to time, the Company may establish, maintain and distribute employee manuals or handbooks or personnel policy manuals, and officers or other representatives of the Company may make written or oral statements relating to personnel policies and procedures. Such manuals, handbooks and statements are intended only for general guidance.

  (d) All of the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the respective heirs, representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto, except that the duties and responsibilities of the Employee and the Company hereunder shall not be assignable in whole or in part by the Company.  
     
  17.  Severability . If any provision of this Agreement or application thereof to anyone or under any circumstances shall be determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions or applications of this Agreement which can be given effect without the invalid or unenforceable provision or application.  
     
  18.  Remedies Cumulative; No Waiver . No right conferred upon the Employee by this Agreement is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and each and every such right or remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to any other right or remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity. No delay or omission by the Employee in exercising any right, remedy or power hereunder or existing at law or in equity shall be construed as a waiver thereof, including without limitation any delay by the Employee in delivering a Notice of Termination pursuant to Section 2 hereof after an event has occurred which would, if the Employee had resigned, have constituted a Termination upon a Change of Control pursuant to Section 1(n)(ii) of this Agreement.  
     
  19.  Compliance with Section 409(A) of the Code . This Agreement is intended to comply with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and shall be interpreted to be consistent with Section 409A of the Code.
