  Executive Summary 
    
  Overview.   The Bank's financial condition and results of operations are influenced by global and national economies, local economies within its three-state district, and the conditions in the financial, housing and credit markets; all of which impact the interest rate environment. 
    
  The interest rate environment significantly impacts the Bank's profitability. Net interest income is affected by several external factors, including market interest rate levels and volatility, credit spreads and the general state of the economy. To manage interest rate risk, a portion of the Bank's advances and debt have been hedged with interest-rate exchange agreements in which 1-month or 3-month LIBOR is received (advances) or paid (debt). Short-term interest rates also directly affect the Bank's earnings on invested capital. Finally, the Bank's mortgage-related assets make it sensitive to changes in mortgage rates. The Bank earns relatively narrow spreads between yields on assets (particularly advances, its largest asset) and the rates paid on corresponding liabilities. During the third quarter of 2016, funding spreads (i.e., the cost of FHLBank debt relative to LIBOR), particularly short-term funding spreads, improved considerably. This development was driven by the pending implementation of new regulations applicable to institutional money market funds. The reform measures, which took effect in October 2016, spurred an increase in 3-month LIBOR which increased investor demand for FHLBank short-term consolidated obligations during the quarter. 
    
  The Bank's earnings are affected not only by rising or falling interest rates but also by the particular path and volatility of changes in market interest rates and the prevailing shape of the yield curve. The flattening of the yield curve tends to compress the Bank's net interest margin, while steepening of the curve offers better opportunities to purchase assets with wider net interest spreads.  The performance of the Bank's mortgage asset portfolios is particularly affected by shifts in the 10-year maturity range of the yield curve, which is the point that heavily influences mortgage rates and potential refinancings.  Yield curve shape can also influence the pace at which borrowers refinance or prepay their existing loans, as borrowers may select  
  
   1 

shorter-duration mortgage products.  The Bank continues to adjust as necessary its prepayment estimates in its models to ensure they reflect actual borrower activity.  In addition, the Bank's higher yielding private label MBS portfolio continues its expected runoff.  As higher coupon mortgage loans prepay and mature along with higher yielding private label MBS, the return of principal cannot be invested in assets with a comparable yield, resulting in a decline in the aggregate yield on the remaining loan portfolio and investments and a possible decrease in the net interest margin.  However, the Bank has accretion of interest income on certain private label residential MBS as a result of significant projected increases in cash flows. During the   third quarter   of 2016, this accretion resulted in additional interest income of $6.4 million compared to $6.8 million in the same prior-year period. 
    
  Results of Operations  . The Bank's net income for the   third quarter   of 2016 was   $54.8 million   compared to   $50.3 million   for the   third quarter   of 2015. This   $4.5   million increase was driven primarily by lower net losses on derivatives and hedging activities, partially offset by net losses on trading securities, lower net interest income and higher other expenses.  Net interest income was $79.2 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in net interest income in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by increased interest expense on consolidated obligations, largely offset by higher interest income on advances.  The net interest margin was 36 basis points in both the   third quarter   of 2016 and the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , net income was   $178.3 million  , compared to   $202.1 million   for the same prior-year period.  The $23.8 million decrease was primarily due to increased net losses on derivatives and hedging activities, along with lower gains on litigation settlements (net of legal fees and expenses) and higher other expenses, partially offset by net gains on trading securities, increased net interest income and net realized gains (losses) on sales of available-for-sale (AFS) securities.  Net interest income was $254.2 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $239.7 million in the same prior-year period.  The increase in net interest income in the first nine months of  2016 was primarily driven by increased interest income on advances, prepayment fees on advances and interest on Federal funds sold, partially offset by increased interest expense on consolidated obligations. The net interest margin was 38 basis points and 37 basis points for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Financial Condition.   Advances.     Total advances were   $71.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of $2.7 billion compared to   $74.5 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  The decline from year-end 2015 was primarily driven by certain prepayments and merger activity in the regional member classification.  It is not uncommon for the Bank to experience variances in the overall advance portfolio driven primarily by changes in member needs.  As the advance portfolio decreased in size during the   third quarter   of 2016, compared to December 31, 2015, the term of advances increased modestly.  At   September 30, 2016  , approximately 56% of the par value of advances in the portfolio had a remaining maturity of more than one year, compared to 55% at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The ability to grow and/or maintain the advance portfolio is affected by, among other things, the following: (1) the liquidity demands of the Bank's borrowers; (2) the composition of the Bank's membership; (3) members' regulatory requirements; (4) current and future credit market conditions; (5) housing market trends; (6) the shape of the yield curve and (7) advance pricing. 
    
  Investments.     At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank held   $17.6 billion   of total investments, including trading, AFS and held-to-maturity (HTM) investment securities, as well as securities purchased under agreements to resell, interest-bearing deposits and Federal funds sold.  By comparison, at   December 31, 2015  , these investments totaled $16.1 billion.  The increase of $1.5 billion was primarily driven by purchases of term certificates of deposit in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Consolidated Obligations.   The Bank's consolidated obligations totaled   $90.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of $0.6 billion from   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , bonds represented 75% of the Bank's consolidated obligations, compared with 53% at   December 31, 2015  .  Discount notes represented 25% of the Bank's consolidated obligations at   September 30, 2016   compared with 47% at year-end 2015. Investor demand for certain structures shifted during the first nine months of 2016, which included increased demand for floating-rate and short-term, fixed-rate bonds.  In addition, the Bank reduced its refunding risk exposure by issuing longer term bonds. 
    
  In April 2016, Moody's affirmed the Aaa senior debt and P-1 ratings of the FHLBank System and affirmed the Aaa bank deposit and P-1 ratings of all 11 FHLBanks and the A2 subordinated debt of FHLBank Chicago.  The outlook on the FHLBank System's and FHLBanks' ratings is stable. 
    
  Capital Position and Regulatory Requirements  . Total capital at   September 30, 2016   was $4.6 billion, compared to $4.5 billion at   December 31, 2015  .  Total retained earnings at   September 30, 2016   were   $942.2 million  , up $61.0 million from $881.2 million at year-end 2015, reflecting the Bank's net income for the first nine months of 2016 which was partially offset  
  
   2 

by dividends paid.  Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) was   $129.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of $48.7 million from   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  In February 2016, the Bank paid a quarterly dividend equal to an annual yield of 5.0% and 3.0% on activity stock and membership stock, respectively. In April, July, and October 2016, the Bank paid quarterly dividends equal to an annual yield of 5.0% and 2.0% on activity stock and membership stock, respectively. These dividends were based on stockholders' average balances for the first quarter of 2016 (April dividend), the second quarter of 2016 (July dividend) and the third quarter of 2016 (October dividend). 
    
  The Bank met all of its capital requirements as of   September 30, 2016  , and in the Federal Housing Finance Agency's (Finance Agency) most recent determination, as of June 30, 2016, the Bank was deemed "adequately capitalized."

Earnings Performance 
    
  The following is Management's Discussion and Analysis of the Bank's earnings performance for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, which should be read in conjunction with the Bank's unaudited interim financial statements included in this Form 10-Q as well as the audited financial statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K. 

Summary of Financial Results 
    
  Net Income and Return on Average Equity.   The Bank s net income for the third quarter of 2016 was $54.8 million compared to $50.3 million for the third quarter of 2015. This $4.5 million increase was driven primarily by lower net losses on derivatives and hedging activities, partially offset by net losses on trading securities, lower net interest income and higher other expenses.  Net losses on derivatives and hedging activities were $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to net losses of $25.4 million in the third quarter of 2015. Partially offsetting this $23.0 million improvement, net losses on trading securities in the third quarter of 2016 were $2.6 million, compared to net gains of $8.7 million in the third quarter of 2015; net interest income was $79.2 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $83.1 million in the third quarter of 2015, and total other expense was $19.2 million in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $16.7 million in the third quarter of 2015. The decrease in net interest income in the third quarter of 2016 was primarily driven by increased interest expense on consolidated obligations, largely offset by higher interest income on advances.  The Bank's return on average equity for the   third quarter   of 2016 was   5.10%   compared to   4.65%   for the   third quarter   of 2015. 
    
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net income was $178.3 million compared to $202.1 million for the same prior-year period. The $23.8 million decrease was primarily due to increased net losses on derivatives and hedging activities, along with lower gains on litigation settlements (net of legal fees and expenses) and higher other expenses, partially offset by net gains on trading securities, increased net interest income and net realized gains (losses) on sales of available-for-sale securities.  Net losses on derivatives and hedging activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $54.4 million,  
  
   5 

an increase of $50.5 million compared to net losses of $3.9 million in the same period in 2015. Gains on litigation settlements (net of legal fees and expenses) arising from investments the Bank made in private-label mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were $0.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $15.3 million in the same year-ago period. Partially offsetting these items, net gains on trading securities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $25.6 million compared to $5.4 million in the same period in 2015; net interest income was $254.2 million in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $239.7 million in the same prior-year period.  In addition, results for the first nine months of 2016 included $12.6 million of net realized gains on sales of AFS securities. The increase in net interest income in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily driven by increased interest income on advances, prepayment fees on advances and interest on Federal funds sold, partially offset by increased interest expense on consolidated obligations.  The Bank's return on average equity was   5.55%   for the first nine months of 2016 and   6.56%   for the comparable prior year period. 

Net Interest Income 
    
  The following table summarizes the yields and rates paid on interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, the average balance for each of the primary balance sheet classifications, and the net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
    
  Average Balances and Interest Yields/Rates Paid 

Notes: 
   (1)    The average balance of Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and the related interest income and average yield calculations may include loans to other FHLBanks. 
   (2)    Average balances of deposits (assets and liabilities) include cash collateral received from/paid to counterparties which is reflected in the Statements of Condition as derivative assets/liabilities. 
   (3)    Investment securities include trading, AFS and HTM securities. The average balances of AFS and HTM are reflected at amortized cost; therefore, the resulting yields do not give effect to changes in fair value or the noncredit component of a previously recognized OTTI reflected in AOCI. 
  
   6 

(4)    Average balances reflect noninterest-earning hedge accounting adjustments of $0.2 billion in 2016 and 2015. 
   (5)    Nonaccrual mortgage loans are included in average balances in determining the average rate. 
   (6)    The noncredit portion of OTTI losses on investment securities is reflected in other assets for purposes of the average balance sheet presentation. 
   (7)    Average balances reflect noninterest-bearing hedge accounting adjustments of $29.2 million and $(1.9) million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  Net interest income for the third quarter of 2016 decreased $3.9 million from the third quarter of 2015 due to an increase in interest expense, partially offset by higher interest income.  Interest-earning assets decreased 3.2% primarily due to prepayment and maturity of short-term advances. Interest expense increased due to higher volume of consolidated obligation bonds and a 32 basis point increase in the rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Interest income on advances increased due to an increase in yield which more than offset the decrease in volume. Interest income on Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell increased due to an increase in yield.  Interest income on investments increased due to higher volume.  

Notes: 
   (1)    The average balance of Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and the related interest income and average yield calculations may include loans to other FHLBanks. 
   (2)    Average balances of deposits (assets and liabilities) include cash collateral received from/paid to counterparties which is reflected in the Statements of Condition as derivative assets/liabilities. 
   (3)    Investment securities include trading, AFS and HTM securities. The average balances of AFS and HTM are reflected at amortized cost; therefore, the resulting yields do not give effect to changes in fair value or the noncredit component of a previously recognized OTTI reflected in AOCI. 
   (4)    Average balances reflect noninterest-earning hedge accounting adjustments of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
   (5)    Nonaccrual mortgage loans are included in average balances in determining the average rate. 
   (6)    The noncredit portion of OTTI losses on investment securities is reflected in other assets for purposes of the average balance sheet presentation. 
   (7)    Average balances reflect noninterest-bearing hedge accounting adjustments of $31.0 million and $3.9 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

7 

Net interest income for the first nine months of 2016 increased $14.5 million from the same prior year period due to an increase in interest income, partially offset by higher interest expense.  Interest-earning assets increased 3.4% primarily due to higher demand for advances and increased purchases of investments, Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell.  Higher interest income on advances, investments, Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell was partially offset by lower interest income on mortgage loans held for portfolio.  Interest income on advances increased due to prepayment fees, higher volume, and an increase in yield. Interest income on investments increased due to higher volume.  Interest income on Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell increased due to both higher volume and an increase in yield.  Interest income on mortgage loans held for portfolio declined due to the run-off of higher-yielding assets that have been replaced with lower-yielding assets.  The rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities increased 27 basis points due to higher funding costs on consolidated obligations bonds and discount notes. 
    
  Rate/Volume Analysis.   Changes in both volume and interest rates influence changes in net interest income and net interest margin.  The following table summarizes changes in interest income and interest expense between the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Interest income and interest expense both increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.  Higher rates drove the interest income increase in both comparisons. Interest expense reflected higher rates on consolidated obligations along with a volume increase in consolidated obligation bonds. 
    
  The following table presents the average par balances of the Bank's advance portfolio for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  These balances do not reflect any hedge accounting adjustments.   

  Advance volume fluctuations in the comparisons were driven primarily by demand from larger members. The rate increase quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year was primarily due to an increase in market interest rates as the Federal funds target rate increased in mid-December 2015. Additional prepayment fees also contributed to the year-over-year increase. 
    
  Interest expense on the average consolidated obligations portfolio increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year.  Rates paid on both discount notes and bonds rose as the Federal funds target rate increased in mid-December 2015. An increase in average bond balances in both comparisons also contributed to the increase.  A portion of the bond portfolio is currently  
  
   8 

swapped to 3-month LIBOR; therefore, as the LIBOR rate (decreases) increases, interest expense on swapped bonds, including the impact of swaps, (decreases) increases. See details regarding the impact of swaps on the rates paid in the  Interest Income Derivatives Effects  discussion below. 
    
  Interest Income Derivative Effects.   The following tables quantify the effects of the Bank's derivative activities on interest income and interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Derivative and hedging activities are discussed below.   

9 

Note  : 
   (1)    Impact of Derivatives includes net interest settlements, amortization of basis adjustments resulting from previously terminated hedging relationships and the amortization of the market value of mortgage purchase commitments classified as derivatives at the time the commitment settled. 
    
  The use of derivatives reduced net interest income and net interest spread for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The use of derivatives had little impact to net interest income and net interest spread for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The use of derivatives increased net interest income and net interest spread for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The variances in the advances and consolidated obligation derivative impacts from period to period are driven by the change in the average LIBOR-based variable rate, the timing of interest rate resets and the average hedged portfolio balances outstanding during any given period. 
  The Bank uses derivatives to hedge the fair market value changes attributable to the change in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate. The Bank generally uses interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of advances and consolidated obligations which  
  
   10 

convert the interest rates on those instruments from a fixed rate to a LIBOR-based variable rate. The purpose of this strategy is to protect the interest rate spread. Using derivatives to convert interest rates from fixed to variable can increase or decrease net interest income. 
  The Bank uses many different funding and hedging strategies. One strategy involves closely match-funding bullet advances with bullet debt. This is designed in part to avoid the use of derivatives where prudent and reduce the Bank's reliance on short-term funding. 
    
  Provision (Benefit) for Credit Losses.   The provision (benefit) for credit losses on mortgage loans held for portfolio and Banking on Business (BOB) loans for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.7 million compared to $(0.2) million for the same period in 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the provision (benefit) for credit losses on mortgage loans held for portfolio and BOB loans was $1.1 million and $(0.4) million, respectively.  In 2015, the MPF portfolio had improvements in the credit performance which resulted in an overall provision benefit.  In 2016, the credit performance of the MPF portfolio returned to more normal levels and a provision expense was recorded. 

11 

Other Noninterest Income 

The change in the Bank's total other noninterest income for the   third quarter   of 2016 compared to the same prior year period was due primarily to lower net losses on derivatives and hedging activities, partially offset by net losses on trading securities in 2016 compared with net gains in 2015.  The change in the Bank's total other noninterest income for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same prior year period was due primarily to higher net losses on derivatives and hedging activities and lower gains on litigation settlements, net of legal fees and expenses, arising from investments the Bank made in private label MBS.  These amounts were partially offset by higher net gains on trading securities and net realized gains from the sales of AFS securities. 
    
  The activity related to derivatives and hedging is discussed in more detail below.  The net gains on trading securities reflects the impact of fair market value changes on Agency investments held in the Bank's trading portfolio.  During the first and third quarters of 2016, the Bank sold Agency, private label MBS and home equity line of credit (HELOC) securities from its AFS portfolio. 

Derivatives and Hedging Activities.   The Bank enters into interest rate swaps, caps, floors and swaption agreements, referred to collectively as interest rate exchange agreements and more broadly as derivatives transactions. The Bank enters into derivatives transactions to offset all or portions of the financial risk exposures inherent in its member lending, investment and funding activities. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in derivatives' fair values are recorded in the Statements of Income.  
    
  The Bank's hedging strategies consist of fair value accounting hedges and economic hedges. Fair value hedges are discussed in more detail below. Economic hedges address specific risks inherent in the Bank's balance sheet, but either they do not qualify for hedge accounting or the Bank does not elect to apply hedge accounting. As a result, income recognition on the derivatives in economic hedges may vary considerably compared to the timing of income recognition on the underlying asset or liability. The Bank does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes nor does it have any cash flow hedges. 
    
  Regardless of the hedge strategy employed, the Bank's predominant hedging instrument is an interest rate swap. At the time of inception, the fair market value of an interest rate swap generally equals or is close to zero. Notwithstanding the exchange of interest payments made during the life of the swap, which are recorded as either interest income/expense or as a gain (loss) on derivatives, depending upon the accounting classification of the hedging instrument, the fair value of an interest rate swap returns to zero at the end of its contractual term. Therefore, although the fair value of an interest rate swap is likely to change over the course of its full term, upon maturity any unrealized gains and losses generally net to zero. 

12 

The following tables detail the net effect of derivatives and hedging activities for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

13 

Notes: 
   (1)    Represents the amortization/accretion of hedging fair value adjustments. 
   (2)    Represents interest income/expense on derivatives included in net interest income. 
    
    Fair Value Hedges.    The Bank uses fair value hedge accounting treatment for most of its fixed-rate advances and consolidated obligations using interest rate swaps.  The interest rate swaps convert these fixed-rate instruments to a variable-rate (i.e., LIBOR).  Fair value hedge ineffectiveness represents the difference between the change in the fair value of the derivative compared to the change in the fair value of the underlying asset/liability hedged.  Fair value hedge ineffectiveness is generated by movement in the benchmark interest rate being hedged and by other structural characteristics of the transaction involved. For example, the presence of an upfront fee associated with a structured debt hedge will introduce valuation differences between the hedge and hedged item that will fluctuate over time.  During the   third quarter   of 2016, the Bank recorded net losses of $(0.2) million compared to net losses of   $(0.9) million   during the   third quarter   of 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank recorded net losses of   $(5.3) million   and net gains of   $2.5 million  , respectively  The total notional amount increased to   $34.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , up from   $30.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Derivatives not receiving hedge accounting.    For derivatives not receiving hedge accounting, also referred to as economic hedges, the Bank includes the net interest settlements and the fair value changes in the "Net gains (losses) on derivatives and hedging activities" financial statement line item.  For economic hedges, the Bank recorded net losses of   $(2.2) million   in the   third quarter   of 2016 compared to net losses of   $(24.5) million   for the   third quarter   of 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Bank recorded net losses of   $(49.1) million   and net losses of   $(6.4) million  , respectively.  For the first nine months of 2016, the losses were concentrated in longer term economic hedges.  Changes in the composition of the economic hedge portfolio, including an increase in the notional amount of economic asset swaps as well as decreases in mid-and-long term interest rates during first nine months of 2016, resulted in larger losses compared to the first nine months of 2015.  The total notional amount of economic hedges, which includes mortgage delivery commitments, was   $16.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $14.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . 

Other Expense 
    
  The Bank's total other expenses increased $2.5 million to $19.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same prior year period.  For the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same prior year period, the Bank's total other expense increased $6.8 million, to $58.8 million.  The increases in the third quarter and year-to-date 2016 periods were primarily due to higher compensation and benefits related expenses, technology related costs, and Finance Agency assessments.  In addition, the increase noted in the first nine months of 2016 also was impacted by a $2.0 million voluntary contribution to the Bank's pension plan in the second quarter of 2016.

Financial Condition 
    
  The following should be read in conjunction with the Bank's unaudited interim financial statements in this Form 10-Q and the audited financial statements in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K. 

Assets 
    
  Total assets were   $95.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $96.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , a decrease of $0.5 billion.  Advances totaled   $71.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $74.5 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Bank's core mission activities primarily include the issuance of advances.  In addition, the Bank acquires member assets through the Mortgage Partnership Finance        (MPF       ) program.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank's average par amounts for advances and MPF loans totaled $69.9 billion resulting in a core mission asset ratio of 82.1%. 
    
  Advances.    Advances (par) totaled   $71.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $74.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had advances to 181 borrowing members, compared to 199 borrowing members at   December 31, 2015  .  The percentage of borrowing members to total members at period end was 59.5% and 64.8% for September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. A significant amount of the advances continued to be generated from the Bank s five largest borrowers, reflecting the asset concentration mix of the Bank s membership base.  Total advances outstanding to the Bank s five largest members increased slightly to   76.6%   of total advances as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to 74.1% at   December 31, 2015  .  However, for the five largest borrowers at each of these dates, there were some significant changes in total advances by member. 
    
  The following table provides information on advances at par by product type at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

The Bank had no putable advances at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  
   15 

The following table provides a distribution of the number of members, categorized by individual member asset size that had an outstanding advance balance during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015.  Commercial Bank, Thrift, and Credit Union members are classified by asset size as follows: Large (over $25 billion), Regional ($4 to $25 billion), Mid-size ($1.1 to $4 billion) and Community Financial Institutions (CFI) (under $1.1 billion). 

Notes: 
   (1)    For purposes of this member classification reporting, the Bank groups smaller credit unions with CFIs.  CFIs are FDIC-insured depository institutions whose assets do not exceed the applicable regulatory limit. 
    
  The total number of members as of September 30, 2016 decreased to 304, compared to 307 as of December 31, 2015. The Bank added eight new members and lost 11 members. One member was placed into receivership with its charter being dissolved.  With no credit exposure outstanding to the Bank, the institution was closed by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities on May 6, 2016.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) was appointed receiver, and it entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with an out-of-district institution to assume substantially all of the assets and deposits of the failed institution.  One member merged with another institution outside of the Bank's district, and nine members merged with other institutions within the Bank's district. 
    
  The following table provides information at par on advances by member classification at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

As of   September 30, 2016  , total advances decreased 3.5 % compared with balances at December 31, 2015.  The decline from year-end 2015 in the Regional classification was primarily driven by certain prepayments and merger activity.  It is not uncommon for the Bank to experience variances in the overall advance portfolio driven primarily by changes in member needs. 
    
  See the  Credit and Counterparty Risk - TCE and Collateral  discussion in the Risk Management section of this Item 2 for further information on collateral policies and practices and details regarding eligible collateral, including amounts and percentages of eligible collateral securing member advances as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio.        Mortgage loans held for portfolio, net of allowance for credit losses, was   $3.3 billion   and $3.1 billion at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The Bank s focus is on purchasing MPF loans originated by the member institutions located in its district. 
    
  The Bank places c  onventional mortgage loans that are 90 days or more delinquent on nonaccrual status.  In addition, the Bank records cash payments received as a reduction of principal     until the remaining principal amount due is expected to be collected and then as a recovery of any charge-off, if applicable, followed by the recording of interest income  .  However,  
  
   16 

government mortgage loans that are 90 days or more delinquent remain in accrual status due to government guarantees or insurance.     The Bank has a loan modification program for participating financial institutions (PFIs) under the MPF Program. The Bank considers loan modifications or Chapter 7 bankruptcies where the obligation is discharged under the MPF Program to be troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), since some form of concession has been made by the Bank.  Balances regarding the Bank s products are summarized below.   

  Notes: 
   (1)    There are no advances which are past due or on nonaccrual status. 
   (2)    All mortgage loans are fixed-rate. Balances are reflected net of the allowance for credit losses.  
   (3)    Nonaccrual mortgage loans are reported net of interest applied to principal and does not include performing TDRs of $12.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $14.8 million at December 31, 2015. 
   (4)    Only government-insured or -guaranteed loans continue to accrue interest after becoming 90 days or more delinquent. 
    
  The performance of the mortgage loans in the Bank s MPF Program has been relatively stable since year-end 2015 and the MPF     Original portfolio continues to out-perform the market based on national delinquency statistics.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s seriously delinquent mortgage loans (90 days or more delinquent or in the process of foreclosure) represented 0.5% of the MPF Original portfolio and 2.8% of the MPF Plus portfolio compared with 0.5% and 3.3%, respectively, at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  Allowance for Credit Losses (ACL).   The Bank has not incurred any losses on advances since its inception. Due to the collateral held as security and the repayment history for advances, management believes that an ACL for advances is not appropriate under GAAP. This assessment also includes letters of credit, which have the same collateral requirements as advances. For additional information, see discussion regarding collateral policies and standards on the advances portfolio in the Advance Products discussion in Item 1. Business in the Bank's 2015 Form10-K.  
    
  The ACL on mortgage loans is based on the losses inherent in the Bank's mortgage loan portfolio after taking into consideration the credit enhancement (CE) structure of the MPF Program. The losses inherent in the portfolio are based on either an individual or collective assessment of the mortgage loans.  The Bank purchases government-guaranteed and/or -insured and conventional fixed-rate residential mortgage loans.  Because the credit risk on the government-guaranteed/insured loans is predominantly assumed by other entities, only conventional mortgage loans are evaluated for an ACL.  
    
  The Bank s conventional mortgage loan portfolio is comprised of large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans made to borrowers of PFIs that are secured by residential real estate. A mortgage loan is considered impaired when it is probable that all contractual principal and interest payments will not be collected as scheduled based on current information and events. The Bank evaluates certain conventional mortgage loans for impairment individually.  Beginning January 1, 2015, the Bank adopted the charge-off provisions of AB 2012-02. As a result, the estimated credit loss on individually evaluated MPF loans is charged off against the reserve. However, if the estimated loss can be recovered through CE, a receivable is established, resulting in a net charge-off. The CE receivable is evaluated for collectibility, and a reserve, included as part of the allowance for credit losses, is established, if required.  
    
  The remainder of the portfolio's incurred loss is estimated using a collective assessment, which is based on probability of default and loss given default. Probability of default and loss given default are based on the prior 12-month historical performance of the Bank's mortgage loans. Probability of default is based on a migration analysis, and loss given default is based on realized losses incurred on the sale of mortgage loan collateral including a factor that reduces estimated proceeds from primary mortgage insurance (PMI) based on the credit deterioration experienced by those companies.  
    
  The CE structure of the MPF Program is designed such that initial losses on mortgage loans are incurred by the Bank up to an agreed upon amount, referred to as the first loss account (FLA). Additional eligible credit losses are covered by CEs provided by PFIs (available CE) until exhausted. Certain losses incurred by the Bank on MPF Plus can be recaptured by withholding fees paid to the PFI for its retention of credit risk. All additional losses are incurred by the Bank. The following table presents the impact of the CE structure on the ACL and the balance of the FLA and available CE at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Investments.    At   September 30, 2016  , the sum of the Bank's interest-bearing deposits, Federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell was $4.2 billion, a decrease of approximately $0.8 billion from   December 31, 2015  .  The Bank's strategy is to maintain its short-term liquidity position in part to be able to meet members' loan demand and regulatory liquidity requirements.  Investment securities including trading, AFS, and HTM securities, totaled   $13.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $11.2 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Details of the investment securities portfolio follow. 

19 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank held securities from the following issuers with a book value greater than 10% of Bank total capital. 

For additional information on the credit risk of the investment portfolio, see Credit and Counterparty Risk - Investments discussion in the Risk Management section of this Item 2. 

Liabilities and Capital 
    
  Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Items.   As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank was obligated to fund approximately   $829.0 million   in additional advances and BOB loans,   $32.2 million   of mortgage loans and   $20.2 billion   in outstanding standby letters of credit, and to issue $223.6 million in consolidated obligations.  The Bank does not consolidate any off-balance sheet special purpose entities or other off-balance sheet conduits. 
    
  Capital and Retained Earnings.   The Finance Agency has issued regulatory guidance to the FHLBanks relating to capital management and retained earnings. The guidance directs each FHLBank to assess, at least annually, the adequacy of its retained earnings with consideration given to future possible financial and economic scenarios. The guidance also outlines the considerations that each FHLBank should undertake in assessing the adequacy of its retained earnings. 
    
  Management monitors capital adequacy, including the level of retained earnings, through the evaluation of market value of equity to par value of capital stock (MV/CS) as well as other risk metrics. Details regarding these metrics are discussed in the Risk Management portion of this Item 2. 
    
  Management has developed and adopted a framework for evaluating retained earnings adequacy, consistent with regulatory guidance and requirements. Retained earnings are intended to cover unexpected losses and protect members' par value of capital stock. The framework includes four risk elements that comprise the Bank's total retained earnings target: (1) market risk (which includes private label MBS risk); (2) credit risk; (3) operating risk; and (4) accounting risk. The retained earnings target generated from this framework is sensitive to changes in the Bank's risk profile, whether favorable or unfavorable.  The framework assists management in its overall analysis of the level of future dividends.  The framework generated a retained earnings target of $419 million as of   September 30, 2016  . The Bank's retained earnings of   $942.2 million   at   September 30, 2016   exceeded the target. 
    
  Retained earnings increased $61.0 million to   $942.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to $881.2 million at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in retained earnings during the first nine months of 2016 reflected net income that was partially offset by $117.3 million of dividends paid.  Total retained earnings at   September 30, 2016   included unrestricted retained earnings of   $744.0 million   and restricted retained earnings (RRE) of   $198.2 million  .

Capital Resources 
    
  The following should be read in conjunction with the unaudited interim financial statements included in this Form 10-Q, the audited financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data and the Capital Resources section of Item 1. Business in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Risk-Based Capital (RBC) 
    
  The Finance Agency s RBC regulatory framework requires the Bank to maintain sufficient permanent capital, defined as retained earnings plus capital stock, to meet its combined credit risk, market risk and operations risk. Each of these components is computed as specified in regulations and directives issued by the Finance Agency. 

Note: 
   (1)    Capital stock includes mandatorily redeemable capital stock. 
    
  On September 20, 2016, the Bank received final notification from the Finance Agency that it was considered "adequately capitalized" for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  As of the date of this filing, the Bank has not received final notice from the Finance Agency regarding its capital classification for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Regulatory Capital and Leverage Ratios 
    
  In addition to the RBC requirements, the Finance Agency has mandated maintenance of total regulatory capital and leverage ratios of at least 4.0% and 5.0% of total assets, respectively. Management has an ongoing program to measure and monitor compliance with the ratio requirements.  The Bank exceeded all regulatory capital requirements at   September 30, 2016  . 

21 

The Bank's capital stock is owned by its members.  The concentration of the Bank's capital stock by institution type is presented below. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  The Bank's financial statements are prepared by applying certain accounting policies. Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K describes the most significant accounting policies used by the Bank. In addition, the Bank's critical accounting policies and estimates are presented in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K. Certain of these policies require management to make estimates or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or be subject to variations that may significantly affect the Bank's reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods. Management views these policies as critical accounting policies. 
    
  The Bank made no changes to its critical accounting policies during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In addition to evaluating the Bank's private label MBS portfolio under a base case (or best estimate) scenario, a cash flow analysis was also performed for each of the Bank's private label MBS under a more stressful housing price scenario.  This additional scenario was used to determine the amount of credit losses, if any, that would have been recorded in earnings during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 if the more stressful housing price scenario had been used in the Bank's OTTI assessment as of September 30, 2016.  The more stressful scenario results were immaterial.  A more detailed discussion of this analysis is in the OTTI section of Credit and Counterparty Risk - Investments of this Item 2. 
    
  Proposed and Recently Issued Accounting Guidance.   The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance which makes substantial changes to the accounting for credit losses on certain financial instruments. The guidance replaces today s incurred loss model with a new model based on expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. The Bank is evaluating the impact of this guidance and will assess its impact, if any, on the Bank s financial assets, including advances, MPF loans, BOB loans, repurchase agreements, and AFS and HTM securities. The guidance is required to be adopted no later than January 1, 2020. 
    
  The FASB proposed guidance which will update certain areas of the accounting for derivatives and hedging. The new guidance is intended to better portray the economics of entities  hedging activities and simplify the application of certain hedge accounting guidance. The Bank is currently evaluating the proposed guidance. 
    
  See Note 1 - Accounting Adjustments, Changes in Accounting Principle and Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Interpretations to the unaudited financial statements in this Form 10-Q for information on new accounting pronouncements impacting the financial statements or becoming effective for the Bank in future periods. 

22 

Legislative and Regulatory Developments  
    
  Significant regulatory actions and developments for the period covered by this report are summarized below. 
    
  Minority and Women Inclusion.    On October 27, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed amendments to its Minority and Women Inclusion regulations that, if adopted, would clarify the scope of the FHLBanks  obligation to promote diversity and ensure inclusion. These proposed amendments update existing Finance Agency regulations aimed at promoting diversity and the inclusion and utilization of minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities in all Bank business and activities, including management, employment and contracting.  The proposed amendments would: 

require the FHLBanks to develop standalone diversity and inclusion strategic plans or incorporate diversity and inclusion into their existing strategic planning processes and adopt strategies for promoting diversity and ensuring inclusion; 
                
    encourage the FHLBanks to expand contracting opportunities for minorities, women, and individuals with disabilities through subcontracting arrangements; 
                
    require the FHLBanks to amend their policies on equal opportunity in employment and contracting by adding sexual orientation, gender identity, and status as a parent to the list of protected classifications; and 
                
    require the FHLBanks to provide information in their annual reports to the Finance Agency about their efforts to advance diversity and inclusion through capital market transactions, affordable housing and community investment programs, initiatives to improve access to mortgage credit, and strategies for promoting the diversity of supervisors and managers.  
       
  Comments on the proposed amendments are due by December 27, 2016.  The Bank is currently assessing the effect of the proposed amendments on the Bank.  
    
  FHLBank Membership for Non-Federally-Insured Credit Unions  .  On September 28, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed amendments to regulations governing FHLBank membership that would implement statutory amendments to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (FHLBank Act) authorizing FHLBanks to accept applications for membership from state-chartered credit unions without Federal share insurance, provided that certain prerequisites have been met. The new rule, if adopted, would generally treat these credit unions the same as other depository institutions with an additional requirement that they obtain an affirmative statement from their state regulator that they meet the requirements for Federal insurance as of the date of their application for FHLBank membership; a written statement from the state regulator that it cannot or will not make any determination regarding eligibility for Federal insurance; or if the regulator fails or refuses to respond to the credit union s request within six months, confirmation of the failure to receive a response. 
    
  Comments are due on the proposed rule by November 28, 2016.  The Bank is currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule but does not anticipate that, if adopted, it would materially impact the Bank. 
    
  Indemnification Payments.   On September 20, 2016, the Finance Agency issued a re-proposed rule that, if adopted, would establish standards for identifying whether an indemnification payment by an FHLBank or the OF to an officer, director, employee, or other entity-affiliated party in connection with an administrative proceeding or civil action instituted by the Finance Agency is prohibited or permissible. Under the proposed rule, those payments with respect to an administrative proceeding or civil action initiated by the Finance Agency are only permitted if they relate to: 

premiums for professional liability insurance or fidelity bonds for directors and officers, to the extent that the insurance or fidelity bond covers expenses and restitution, but not a judgment in favor of the Finance Agency or a civil money penalty; 
                
    expenses of defending an action, subject to an agreement to repay those expenses in certain instances; and 
                
    amounts due under an indemnification agreement entered into on or before September 20, 2016. 
       
  The proposed rule also outlines the process a board of directors must undertake prior to making any permitted indemnification payment for expenses of defending an action.  Comments are due on the proposed rule by December 21, 2016.  The Bank is currently assessing the effect of the proposed rule but does not anticipate that, if adopted, it would materially impact the Bank. 
    
  FHLBank New Business Activities (NBAs)  .  On August 23, 2016, the Finance Agency proposed a rule that, if adopted, would reduce the scope of NBAs for which a FHLBank must seek approval from the Finance Agency and would establish more certain timelines for Finance Agency review and approval of NBA notices. The proposed rule also would clarify the protocol  
  
   23 

for Finance Agency review of NBAs. Under the proposed rule, acceptance of new types of legally permissible collateral by the FHLBanks would not constitute a new business activity or require approval from the Finance Agency prior to acceptance. Instead, the Finance Agency would review new collateral types as part of the annual exam process.  
    
  On October 24, 2016, the FHLBanks provided comments to the proposed rule, which primarily related to certain procedures under the proposed rule. The Bank does not anticipate that the proposed rule, if adopted, would materially impact the Bank. 
    
  Mandatory Contractual Stay Requirements for Qualified Financial Contracts (QFCs)  .  On August 19, 2016, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) issued a proposed rule, which, if adopted, would require certain systemically important financial institutions (SIFI) regulated by the OCC to limit a counterparty s immediate termination or exercise of default rights in the event of bankruptcy or receivership of the SIFI or an affiliate of the SIFI. Covered QFCs include derivatives, repurchase agreements (know as repos) and reverse repos, and securities lending and borrowing agreements.  On May 3, 2016, the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) issued a substantively identical proposed rule with respect to QFCs entered into with globally systemically important banking organizations (GSIBs) and their affiliates that are subject to regulation in the U.S.  Further, on October 26, 2016, the FDIC issued a parallel proposed rule applicable to certain FDIC-supervised institutions. 
    
  The FHLBanks provided comments on the FRB proposed rule on August 5, 2016 and to the OCC proposed rule on October 18, 2016, which primarily seek clarification of an exemption and the recognition of a safe harbor. The Bank does not anticipate that the proposed rule, if adopted, would materially impact the Bank, but the Bank would need to amend any covered QFCs entered into with FRB regulated GSIBs or OCC regulated SIFIs. 
    
  European Union (EU) Market Abuse Regulation (MAR)  .  The EU issued updated MAR that became effective July 3, 2016 and which contain rules on insider dealing, unlawful disclosure of inside information and market manipulation for debt and equity securities on European securities exchanges, which differ in certain respects from U.S. regulations. MAR applies to issuers with securities admitted to trading on EU exchanges, including EU exchanges on which FHLBank consolidated obligations are listed. MAR contains an exemption to its requirements for certain public bodies and central banks of third countries. The OF and FHLBanks are examining whether this exemption applies. If the exemption does not apply, the Bank anticipates that the most significant impact of the MAR on the Bank will be more stringent and detailed recordkeeping, creation of detailed lists of parties who have access to inside information, and notification requirements. 
    
  Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Rule 4210 Establishing Margin Requirements for the to-be-announced (TBA) Market.    On June 15, 2016, the SEC approved a proposed rule by FINRA to require the margining of certain TBA transactions. Specifically, the approved FINRA Rule 4210 will require FINRA members to collect from, but not post to, their customer s maintenance margin (i.e. initial margin) and variation margin on transactions that are  Covered Agency Transactions,  subject to certain exemptions. A  Covered Agency Transaction  includes (certain terms are defined under FINRA rules): 

TBA transactions inclusive of ARM transactions, and specified pool transactions, for which the difference between the trade date and contractual settlement date is greater than one business day; and 
                
    CMOs issued in conformity with a program of an agency or a GSE for which the difference between the trade date and contractual settlement date is greater than three business days. 
       
  Covered Agency Transactions with a counterparty in multifamily housing securities are exempt from the margin requirements provided that certain requirements are met. 
    
  Under the rule, the Bank is exempt from posting initial margin but would be required to post variation margin to its FINRA-member counterparty in connection with covered transactions, provided the Bank has $10 million or more in gross open positions with the counterparty.  FINRA members will be required to comply with the new margin requirements beginning in December 2017. The Bank is currently assessing the financial and operational impacts of this rule on the Bank. 
    
  FRB Framework for Implementing the U.S. Basel III Countercyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB).    On September 8, 2016, the FRB adopted a final policy statement (Policy Statement) describing the framework that the FRB will follow in setting the CCyB for banking organizations that are subject to the advanced approaches capital rules, generally those with more than $250 billion in assets or $10 billion in on-balance-sheet foreign exposures, and to any depository institution subsidiary of such banking organizations. The CCyB supplements the minimum capital requirements and other capital buffers included in existing regulations, which were designed to provide resilience to unexpected losses created by normal fluctuations in economic and financial conditions. Although the Policy Statement does not directly impact the Bank, the potential impact on borrowings by the Bank s larger members is uncertain. 
  
   24 

Risk Management 
    
  The Bank employs a corporate governance and internal control framework designed to support the effective management of the Bank s business activities and the related inherent risks. As part of this framework, the Board has approved a Risk Governance Policy and a Member Products Policy, both of which are reviewed regularly and re-approved at least annually.  The Risk Governance Policy establishes risk guidelines, limits (if applicable), and standards for credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operating risk, and business risk in accordance with Finance Agency regulations and consistent with the Bank s risk appetite.  The Member Products Policy establishes the eligibility and authorization requirements, policy limits and restrictions, and the terms applicable to each type of Bank product or service, as well as collateral requirements.  The risk appetite is established by the Board, as are other applicable guidelines in connection with the Bank s Capital Plan and overall risk management. 

Risk Governance 
    
  The Bank s lending, investment and funding activities and use of derivative instruments expose the Bank to a number of risks that include market and interest rate risk, credit and counterparty risk, liquidity and funding risk, and operating and business risk, among others.  In addition, the Bank s risks are affected by current and projected financial and residential mortgage market trends including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K.  Details regarding the Bank's risk governance framework and processes are included in the "Risk Governance" discussion in Risk Management in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Capital Adequacy Measures  .    MV/CS provides a current assessment of the liquidation value of the balance sheet and measures the Bank's current ability to honor the par put redemption feature of its capital stock.  This is one of the risk metrics used to evaluate the adequacy of retained earnings which is used to develop dividend payment recommendations and support the repurchase of excess capital stock.  
    
  The current Board-approved floor for MV/CS is 90.0%.  MV/CS is measured against the floor monthly.  When MV/CS is below the established floor, excess capital stock repurchases and dividend payouts are restricted.  See the  Capital and Retained Earnings  discussion in Financial Condition in this Item 2 for details regarding the Bank s retained earnings policy. 
    
  The MV/CS ratio was 126.4% at   September 30, 2016   and 127.9% at December 31, 2015. 
    
  Subprime and Nontraditional Loan Exposure.        The Bank policy definitions of subprime and nontraditional residential mortgage loans and securities are consistent with Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) and Finance Agency guidance.  According to policy, the Bank does not accept subprime residential mortgage loans (defined as FICO          score of 660 or below) as qualifying collateral unless there are certain mitigating factors including an LTV ratio of 65% or less (100% if loan level data is provided by the member for valuation) and one of the following: (1) a debt-to-income ratio of 35% (50% if loan level data is provided by member) or less or (2) a satisfactory payment history over the past 12 months (no 30-day delinquencies).    The Bank requires members to identify the amount of subprime and nontraditional mortgage collateral in their Qualifying Collateral Report (QCR) each quarter     and provide periodic certification that they comply with the FFIEC guidance.      Loans identified as subprime which do not have the mitigating factors described above are not included when determining a member s maximum borrowing capacity (MBC). 
    
  Limits have been established for exposure to low FICO          and nontraditional residential mortgages. A limit of 25% has been established for the percentage of member collateral that is categorized as low FICO          (with acceptable mitigating factors), missing (unknown) FICO          score loans and nontraditional loans and securities. A limit of 25% has also been established for total exposure related to nontraditional, subprime and low FICO          whole mortgage loans acquired through the Bank s MPF program.

Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures Regarding Market Risk  
    
  Managing Market Risk  .   The Bank's market risk management objective is to protect member/shareholder and bondholder value consistent with the Bank's housing mission and safe and sound operations across a wide range of interest rate environments. Management believes that a disciplined approach to market risk management is essential to maintaining a strong capital base and uninterrupted access to the capital markets. 
    
  The Bank's Market Risk Model.   Significant resources are devoted to ensuring that the level of market risk in the balance sheet is accurately measured, thus allowing management to monitor the risk against policy and regulatory limits. The Bank uses externally developed models to evaluate its financial position and market risk. One of the most critical market-based models relates to the prepayment of principal on mortgage-related instruments.  Management regularly reviews the major assumptions and methodologies used in its models, as well as the performance of the models relative to empirical results, so that appropriate changes to the models can be made. 
    
  The Bank regularly validates the models used to measure market risk. Such model validations are performed by third-party specialists or the Bank's model risk management department, both of which are considered to be independent.  The model validations are supplemented by additional validation processes performed by the Bank, most notably benchmarking model-derived fair values to those provided by third-party services or alternative internal valuation models. This analysis is performed by a group that is independent of the model owner who is responsible for measuring risk and the units conducting the business transactions. Results of the validation process, as well as any changes in valuation methodologies, are reported to the Bank's Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO), which is responsible for reviewing and approving the approaches used in the valuation of such risks to ensure that they are well controlled and effective and result in reasonable fair values. 
    
  Duration of Equity.   One key risk metric used by the Bank is duration. Duration is a measure of the sensitivity of a financial instrument's value, or the value of a portfolio of instruments, to a 100 basis point parallel shift in interest rates. Duration (typically expressed in years) is commonly used by investors throughout the fixed income securities market as a measure of financial instrument price sensitivity. 
    
  The Bank's asset/liability management policy approved by the Board calls for actual duration of equity to be maintained within a   +   4.5 year range in the base case. In addition, the duration of equity exposure limit in an instantaneous parallel interest rate shock of   +   200 basis points is   +   7 years. Management analyzes the duration of equity exposure against this policy limit on a daily basis and regularly evaluates its market risk management strategies. 
    
  The following table presents the Bank's duration of equity exposure at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Given the low level of interest rates, an instantaneous parallel interest rate shock of "down 200 basis points" and "down 100 basis points" cannot be meaningfully measured for these periods and therefore is not presented. 

Duration of equity changes in the first nine months of 2016 primarily reflect the impact of balance sheet management actions (e.g., funding decisions) which more than offset the impact of lower long-term interest rates. The Bank continues to monitor the mortgage and related fixed-income markets, including the impact that changes in the market or anticipated modeling changes may have on duration of equity and other market risk measures, and may take actions to reduce market risk exposures as needed. Management believes that the Bank's current market risk profile is reasonable given these market conditions. 
    
  Return on Equity (ROE) Spread Volatility  .  Interest rate risk is also measured based on the volatility in the Bank s projected return on capital in excess of the return of an established benchmark market index.  ROE spread is defined as the Bank's return on average equity, including capital stock and retained earnings, in excess of the average of 3-month LIBOR.  ROE spread volatility is a measure of the variability of the Bank s projected ROE spread in response to shifts in interest rates and represents the change in ROE spread compared to an ROE spread that is generated by the Bank in its base forecasting scenario.  ROE spread volatility is measured over a rolling forward 12 month period for selected interest rate scenarios and excludes the income sensitivity resulting from mark-to-market changes which are separately described below. 

26 

The ROE spread volatility presented in the table below reflects spreads relative to 3-month LIBOR. Management uses both parallel and non-parallel rate scenarios to assess interest rate risk.  The steeper and flatter yield curve shift scenarios are represented by appropriate increases and decreases in short-term and long-term interest rates using the three-year point on the yield curve as the pivot point. Given the current low rate environment, management replaced a down 200 basis points parallel rate scenario with a down 100 basis point longer term rate shock as an additional non-parallel rate scenario that reflects a decline in longer term rates.  

The changes in ROE spread volatility in the first nine months of 2016 were mainly the result of balance sheet management actions (e.g. funding decisions) along with the lower long-term interest rate environment. These factors affected ROE spread volatility differently in each scenario, as displayed in the table above.  The Board's limit on the decline in ROE spread is set at no greater than 100 basis points.  The Bank was in compliance with the ROE spread volatility limit across all selected interest rate shock scenarios at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
    
    Mark-to-Market Risk.   The Bank measures earnings risk associated with certain mark-to-market positions, including economic hedges. This framework establishes a forward-looking, scenario-based exposure limit based on interest rate and volatility shocks that would apply to any existing or proposed transaction that is marked to market through the income statement without an offsetting mark arising from a qualifying hedge relationship. The Bank's Capital Markets and Corporate Risk Management departments also monitor the actual profit/loss change on a daily, monthly cumulative, and quarterly cumulative basis. 
    
    During the first nine months of 2016, the daily limit of mark-to-market risk as approved by the Board was $3.5 million. The daily exposure was within this guideline throughout the first nine months of 2016.  At   September 30, 2016  , mark-to-market risk measured $2.4 million. 

27 

Credit and Counterparty Risk - Total Credit Exposure (TCE) and Collateral 
    
  TCE.     The Bank manages the credit risk of each member on the basis of the member s total credit exposure (TCE) to the Bank, which includes advances and related accrued interest, fees, basis adjustments and estimated prepayment fees; letters of credit; forward-dated advance commitments; member derivatives; and MPF credit enhancement and related obligations.  This credit risk is managed by monitoring the financial condition of borrowers and by requiring all borrowers (and, where applicable in connection with member affiliate pledge arrangements approved by the Bank, their affiliates) to pledge sufficient eligible collateral for all borrower obligations to the Bank to ensure that all potential forms of credit-related exposures are covered by sufficient eligible collateral.  This may include collateral pledged by a member s affiliate.  At   September 30, 2016  , aggregate TCE was $94.0 billion, comprised of approximately $71.7 billion in advance principal outstanding, $21.1 billion in letters of credit (including forward commitments), $0.8 billion in advance commitments, and $0.4 billion in accrued interest, prepayment fees, MPF credit enhancement obligations and other fees.  
    
  The Bank establishes an MBC for each member based on collateral weightings applied to eligible collateral as described in the Bank s Member Products Policy.  Details regarding this policy are available in the Advance Products discussion in Item 1. Business in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K.  According to the Policy, eligible collateral is weighted to help ensure that the collateral value will exceed the amount that may be owed to the Bank in the event of a default.  The Bank also has the ability to call for additional or substitute collateral while any indebtedness is outstanding to protect the Bank s fully secured position. 
    
  The financial condition of all members and eligible non-member housing associates is closely monitored for compliance with financial criteria as set forth in the Bank s credit policies.  The Bank has developed an internal credit rating (ICR) system that calculates financial scores and rates member institutions on a quarterly basis using a numerical rating scale from one to ten, with one being the best rating.  Generally, scores are objectively calculated based on financial ratios computed from publicly available data. The scoring system gives the highest weighting to the member s asset quality and capitalization.  Other key factors include earnings and balance sheet composition.  Operating results for the previous four quarters are used, with the most recent quarter s results given a higher weighting.  Additionally, a member s credit score can be adjusted for various qualitative factors, such as the financial condition of the member s holding company.  A rating in one of the higher number (i.e., worse) categories indicates that a member exhibits defined financial weaknesses.  Members in these categories are reviewed for potential collateral delivery status.  Other uses of the ICR include the scheduling of on-site collateral reviews.  A separate financial analysis method is used to analyze insurance company exposure.  While depository institution member analysis is based on standardized regulatory Call Report data and risk modeling, insurance company credit risk analysis is based on various forms of financial data, including, but not limited to, statutory reporting filed by insurance companies with state insurance regulators, which requires specialized methodologies and dedicated underwriting resources. 
    
  During the first nine months of 2016, there were five failures of FDIC-insured institutions nationwide. One of the institutions was a member of the Bank.  With no credit exposure outstanding to the Bank, the institution was closed by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities on May 6, 2016.  The FDIC was appointed receiver, and it entered into a purchase and assumption agreement with an out-of-district institution to assume substantially all of the assets and deposits of the failed institution. 
    
  Management believes that it has adequate policies and procedures in place to effectively manage credit risk exposure related to member TCE.  These credit and collateral policies balance the Bank s dual goals of meeting members  needs as a reliable source of liquidity and limiting credit loss by adjusting the credit and collateral terms in response to deterioration in creditworthiness.  The Bank has never experienced a loss on its member advance exposure; losses have been reserved for mortgage loan exposure in the MPF program. 

28 

The following table presents the Bank s top ten members with respect to their TCE at   September 30, 2016  . 

Notes  : 
   (1)     For Bank membership purposes, principal place of business is Pittsburgh, PA. 
   (2)     For Bank membership purposes, principal place of business is Horsham, PA. 
   (3)     Santander Bank, N.A. is a subsidiary of Banco Santander, which is located in Spain. 
    
    Member Advance Concentration Risk.    The following table lists the Bank s top ten borrowers based on advance balances at par as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Notes  : 
   (1)     For Bank membership purposes, principal place of business is Pittsburgh, PA. 
   (2)     For Bank membership purposes, principal place of business is Horsham, PA. 
   (3)     Santander Bank, N.A. is a subsidiary of Banco Santander, which is located in Spain. 
    
  The average year-to-date   September 30, 2016   balances for the ten largest borrowers totaled $55.7 billion, or 83.3% of total average advances outstanding.  During the first nine months of 2016, the maximum outstanding balance to any one borrower was $21.3 billion.  The advances made by the Bank to each of these borrowers are secured by collateral with an estimated value, after collateral weightings, in excess of the book value of the advances.  The Bank has never incurred any losses on these advances.  The Bank has implemented specific credit and collateral review monitoring for these members. 

29 

Letters of Credit.    The following table presents the Bank s total outstanding letters of credit as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.  The letter of credit product is collateralized under the same policies, procedures and guidelines that apply to advances. 

Notes: 
   (1)     For   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 respectively, excludes approved requests to issue future standby letters of credit of   $158.5 million   and $136.4 million; also excludes available master standby letters of credit of $716.4 million and $479.4 million at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had a concentration of letters of credit with two members (PNC Bank and TD Bank) totaling $12.5 billion or 61.9% of the total outstanding amount.  At December 31, 2015, $12.9 billion or 63.9% of the letters of credit were concentrated with these same two members. 
    
  Collateral Policies and Practices.   All members are required to maintain eligible collateral to secure their TCE. Refer to the Risk Management section of the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information related to the Bank s Collateral Policy. 
    
  Collateral Agreements and Valuation.    The Bank provides members with two types of collateral agreements: a blanket lien collateral pledge agreement and a specific collateral pledge agreement.  Under a blanket lien agreement, the Bank obtains a lien against all of the member s unencumbered eligible collateral assets and most ineligible assets to secure the member s obligations with the Bank.  Under a specific collateral pledge agreement, the Bank obtains a lien against specific eligible collateral assets of the member or its affiliate (if applicable) to secure the member s obligations with the Bank.  The member provides a detailed listing, as an addendum to the specific collateral agreement, identifying those assets pledged as collateral or delivered to the Bank or its third party custodian.  Details regarding average lending values provided under both blanket liens and specific liens and delivery arrangements are available in the "Credit and Counterparty Risk - TCE and Collateral" discussion in Risk Management in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  For all of the Bank's members, the following table summarizes total eligible collateral values, after collateral weighting, by type under both blanket lien and specific collateral pledge agreements as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.  The amount of excess collateral by individual borrowers varies significantly.  

Note  : 
   (1)    High quality investment securities are defined as U.S. Treasury and U.S. Agency securities, REFCORP bonds, GSE MBS, commercial and residential private label MBS with a minimum credit rating of single A, which the Bank considers as part of its evaluation of the collateral. In addition, municipal securities with a real estate nexus (e.g. proceeds primarily used for real estate development) with a minimum credit rating of single A are included.  Members have the option to deliver such high quality investment securities to the Bank to increase their maximum borrowing capacity.  Upon delivery, these securities are valued daily and private label residential MBS are subject to weekly ratings reviews. 
   (2)    Other real estate related collateral 

30 

For member borrowers, the following tables present information on a combined basis regarding the type of collateral securing their outstanding credit exposure and the collateral status as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 

Note  : 
   (1)    High quality investment securities are defined as U.S. Treasury and U.S. Agency securities, REFCORP bonds, GSE MBS, commercial and residential private label MBS with a minimum credit rating of single A, which the Bank considers as part of its evaluation of the collateral. In addition, municipal securities with a real estate nexus (e.g. proceeds primarily used for real estate development) with a minimum credit rating of single A are included.  Members have the option to deliver such high quality investment securities to the Bank to increase their maximum borrowing capacity.  Upon delivery, these securities are valued daily, and private label residential MBS are subject to weekly ratings reviews. 

Credit and Counterparty Risk - Investments 
    
    The Bank is also subject to credit risk on investments consisting of money market investments and investment securities. The Bank considers a variety of credit quality factors when analyzing potential investments, including collateral performance, marketability, asset class or sector considerations, local and regional economic conditions, credit ratings based on NRSROs, and/or the financial health of the underlying issuer.  As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Bank s carrying value of investment securities issued by entities other than the U.S. government, Federal agencies or GSEs was $3.0 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. 

31 

Investment Quality and External Credit Ratings.   The following tables present the Bank s investment carrying values as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, based on the lowest credit rating from the NRSROs (Moody s, S P and Fitch). 

Notes: 
   (1)    Various deposits not held as investments as well as mutual fund equity investments held by the Bank through Rabbi trusts which are not generally assigned a credit rating are excluded from the tables above.  The mutual fund equity investment balances totaled   $8.7   million and $7.4 million at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
   (2)    Balances exclude   $1.9   million and $2.6 million pertaining to one unrated private label MBS at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
   (3)    Balances exclude total accrued interest of $27.2 million and $25.2 million at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
    
  The Bank also manages credit risk based on an internal credit rating system. For purposes of determining the internal credit rating, the Bank measures credit exposure through a process which includes internal credit review and various external factors, including placement of the counterparty on negative watch by one or more NRSROs. For internal reporting purposes, the incorporation of negative credit watch into the credit rating analysis of an investment may translate into a downgrade of one credit rating level from the external rating. The Bank does not rely solely on any NRSRO rating in deriving its final internal credit rating. 
  
   32 

Short-term Investments.    The Bank maintains a short-term investment portfolio to provide funds to meet the credit needs of its members and to maintain liquidity.  The FHLBank Act and Finance Agency regulations set liquidity requirements for the FHLBanks.  In addition, the Bank maintains a contingency liquidity plan in the event of operational disruptions at the Bank and the Office of Finance (OF).  See the Liquidity and Funding Risk section of this Item 2 for a discussion of the Bank s liquidity management. 
    
  Within the portfolio of short-term investments, the Bank faces credit risk from unsecured exposures.  The Bank's unsecured credit investments have maturities generally ranging between overnight and six months and may include the following types:  

Interest-bearing deposits.   Primarily consists of unsecured deposits that earn interest; 
                
    Federal funds sold.   Unsecured loans of reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Banks between financial institutions that are made on an overnight and term basis;    
                
    Certificates of deposit.   Unsecured negotiable promissory notes issued by banks and payable to the bearer on demand.  
       
  Under the Bank s Risk Governance Policy, the Bank can place money market investments, which include those investment types listed above, on an unsecured basis with large financial institutions with long-term credit ratings no lower than BBB. Management actively monitors the credit quality of these counterparties. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had unsecured exposure to 14 counterparties totaling $5.2 billion with four counterparties each exceeding 10% of the total exposure.  The following table presents the Bank's unsecured credit exposure with private counterparties by investment type at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015  .  The unsecured investment credit exposure presented may not reflect the average or maximum exposure during the period. 

Note: 
   (1)    Excludes unsecured investment credit exposure to U.S. government, U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities, GSEs, and supranational entities. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , 83.5% of the Bank s unsecured investment credit exposure in Federal funds sold was to U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks. The Bank actively monitors its credit exposures and the credit quality of its counterparties, including an assessment of each counterparty s financial performance, capital adequacy, sovereign support, and the current market perceptions of the counterparties.  General macro-economic, political and market conditions may also be considered when deciding on unsecured exposure. As a result, the Bank may limit or suspend existing exposures. 
    
  Finance Agency regulations include limits on the amount of unsecured credit the Bank may extend to a counterparty or to a group of affiliated counterparties. This limit is based on a percentage of eligible regulatory capital and the counterparty's overall credit rating. Under these regulations, the level of eligible regulatory capital is determined as the lesser of the Bank's total regulatory capital or the eligible amount of regulatory capital of the counterparty. The eligible amount of regulatory capital is then multiplied by a stated percentage. This percentage is 1% to 15% and is based on the counterparty's credit rating. The calculation of term extensions of unsecured credit includes on-balance sheet transactions, off-balance sheet commitments, and derivative transactions. 
    
  Finance Agency regulation also permits the Bank to extend additional unsecured credit for overnight transactions and for sales of Federal funds subject to continuing contracts that renew automatically.  For overnight exposures only, the Bank's total unsecured exposure to a counterparty may not exceed twice the applicable regulatory limit, or a total of 2% to 30% of the eligible amount of regulatory capital, based on the counterparty's credit rating. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank was in compliance with the regulatory limits established for unsecured credit. 
    
  The Bank's unsecured credit exposures to U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks include the risk that, as a result of political or economic conditions in a country, the counterparty may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. The Bank's unsecured credit exposures to domestic counterparties and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign  
  
   33 

commercial banks include the risk that these counterparties have extended credit to foreign counterparties.  Bank management has limited its unsecured investment activity with all European private counterparties to overnight maturities only. 
    
  The following table presents the long-term credit ratings of the unsecured investment credit exposures by the domicile of the counterparty or the domicile of the counterparty's immediate parent for U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks based on the NRSROs used. This table does not reflect the foreign sovereign government's credit rating.  

Notes: 
   (1)    Does not reflect any changes in ratings, outlook or watch status occurring after   September 30, 2016  . 
   (2)    These ratings represent the lowest rating available for each security owned by the Bank based on the NRSROs used by the Bank.  The Bank s internal ratings may differ from those obtained from the NRSROs. 
   (3)    Excludes unsecured investment credit exposure to U.S. government, U.S. government agencies and instrumentalities, GSEs, and supranational entities. 
   (4)    Represents the NRSRO rating of the counterparty not the country.  There were no AAA-rated investments at either   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 

34 

The following table presents the remaining contractual maturity of the Bank's unsecured investment credit exposure by the domicile of the counterparty or the domicile of the counterparty's parent for U.S. branches and agency offices of foreign commercial banks.  The Bank also mitigates the credit risk on investments by generally investing in investments that have short-term maturities. At December 31, 2015, all the unsecured investments held by the Bank had overnight maturities.  

U.S. Treasury Bills, Agency Securities, GSE Securities and State and Local Agency Obligations.   In addition to U.S. Treasury bills and securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. Agencies or U.S government corporations, the Bank invests in and is subject to credit risk related to GSE securities and state and local agency obligations.  As a secondary liquidity portfolio, the Bank purchases investments such as U.S. Treasury, U.S. Agency and GSE/TVA securities. Further, the Bank maintains a portfolio of state and local agency obligations to enhance net interest income. These portfolios totaled $4.5 billion and $4.2 billion at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. The increase was due to purchases of $1.8 million, partially offset by paydowns of $1.4 billion and the sale of 11 AFS Agency securities with a book value of $178.2 million.  
    
  Agency and GSE MBS.   The Bank invests in and is subject to credit risk related to MBS issued or guaranteed by Federal agencies and GSEs that are directly supported by underlying mortgage loans.  The Bank s total agency and GSE MBS portfolio at   September 30, 2016   was $6.2 billion which was an increase of $597.3 million from December 31, 2015. This was due to purchases of $1.5 billion of securities and increases in the fair value of the securities, partially offset by paydowns of $933.8 million.  
    
  Private Label MBS.   The Bank also holds investments in private label MBS, which are supported by underlying mortgage loans.     The Bank made investments in private label MBS that were rated AAA at the time of purchase with the exception of one, which was rated AA at the time of purchase. However, since the time of purchase, there have been significant downgrades. Current ratings are in the table below. The carrying value of the Bank s private label MBS portfolio at   September 30, 2016   was $1.1 billion which was a decrease of $213.8 million from   December 31, 2015  .  This decline was primarily due to repayments.  In addition, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Bank sold five HELOC securities with a book value of $8.4 million and three private label MBS with a book value of $8.6 million.  These sales were from the Bank's AFS investment portfolio. 
    
  Unrealized gains of OTTI securities in AOCI at   September 30, 2016   were $67.9 million compared to $73.0 million at December 31, 2015.  The decrease was due to recovery of OTTI and the sale of the HELOC securities at a gain.  The weighted average prices on OTTI securities were 87.1 and 87.5 at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. These fair values are determined using unobservable inputs (i.e., Level 3) derived from four third-party pricing services. There continues to be unobservable inputs and a     lack of significant market activity for private label MBS; therefore, as of September 30, 2016, the Bank classified private label MBS as Level 3. The Bank uses the unadjusted prices received from the third-party pricing services in its process relating to fair value calculations and methodologies as described further in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section in Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Approximately 15.4% of the Bank s MBS portfolio at   September 30, 2016   was issued by private label issuers. In late 2007, the Bank discontinued the purchase of private label MBS. 
  
   35 

Participants in the mortgage market often characterize single family loans based upon their overall credit quality at the time of origination, generally considering them to be Prime, Alt-A or subprime. There is no universally accepted definition of these segments or classifications. The subprime segment of the mortgage market primarily serves borrowers with poorer credit payment histories, and such loans typically have a mix of credit characteristics that indicate a higher likelihood of default and higher loss severities than Prime loans. Further, many mortgage participants classify single family loans with credit characteristics that range between Prime and subprime categories as Alt-A because these loans have a combination of characteristics of each category or may be underwritten with low or no documentation compared to a full documentation mortgage loan. Industry participants often use this classification principally to describe loans for which the underwriting process is less rigorous and to reduce the documentation requirements of the borrower. 
    
  Private Label MBS Collateral Statistics.   The following tables provide collateral performance and credit enhancement information for the Bank s private label MBS portfolio by par and by collateral type as of   September 30, 2016  . 

Notes  :  
   (1)    Represents total gross unrealized losses including non-credit-related other-than-temporary impairment recognized in AOCI. The unpaid principal balance and amortized cost of private label MBS in a gross unrealized loss position was   $296.4 million   and   $296.0 million  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  . 
   (2)    For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
   (3)    Delinquency information is presented at the cross-collateralization level. 
    
  OTTI.   The Bank recognized no credit-related OTTI charges in earnings during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $0.2 million during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , and $0.4 million and $0.9 million during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Because the Bank does not intend to sell and it is not more likely than not that the Bank will be required to sell, any OTTI securities before anticipated recovery of their amortized cost basis, the Bank does not have an additional OTTI charge for the difference between amortized cost and fair value.  The Bank has not recorded OTTI on any other type of security (i.e., U.S. Agency MBS or non-MBS securities).  
  
   36 

The Bank s estimate of cash flows has a significant impact on the determination of credit losses. Cash flows expected to be collected are based on the performance and type of private label MBS and the Bank s expectations of the economic environment. To ensure consistency in determination of the OTTI for private label MBS among all FHLBanks, each quarter the Bank works with the OTTI Governance Committee to update its OTTI analysis based on actual loan performance and current housing market assumptions in the collateral loss projection models, which generate the estimated cash flows from the Bank s private label MBS. This process is described in Note 5 - OTTI to the unaudited financial statements included in this Form 10-Q. 
    
  The Bank s quarterly OTTI analysis is based on current and forecasted economic trends.  Significant assumptions used on the Bank s private label MBS as part of its   third quarter   of 2016 analysis are presented below. 

The Bank s life-to-date credit losses are concentrated in its 2006 and 2007 vintage bonds. These vintages represent 92% of life-to-date credit losses, of which 48% relates to Prime and 44% relates to Alt-A, with the remainder in subprime and HELOC.  The Bank has recognized life to date OTTI as follows: 

The table above excludes recoveries of OTTI through interest income, which occur if there is a significant increase in estimated cash flows whereby the Bank increases the yield on the Bank s investment and recognizes recovery as interest income over the life of the investment. OTTI recovered through interest income on these securities was $6.4 million and $6.9 million for the   third quarter  s of 2016 and 2015, respectively; $18.5 million and $21.0 million for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively; and $105.3 million life-to-date. The OTTI recovered through interest income was recognized on 37 private label MBS securities for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015. The same private label MBS can have multiple increases in cash flows that are deemed to be significant. 
    
  The Bank transfers private label MBS from HTM to AFS when an OTTI credit loss is recorded on a security. The Bank believes that a credit loss constitutes evidence of deterioration in the credit quality of the security. The Bank believes that the transfer increases its flexibility to potentially sell other-than-temporarily-impaired securities if it makes economic sense. There were no transfers during the first nine months of 2016.  The Bank transferred one private label MBS from HTM to AFS during the first nine months of 2015, which is the period in which an OTTI credit loss was recorded on the security. 
    
  Management will continue to evaluate all impaired securities, including those on which OTTI has been recorded. Material credit losses have occurred on private label MBS and may occur in the future. The specific amount of credit losses will depend on the actual performance of the underlying loan collateral as well as the Bank s future modeling assumptions. The Bank cannot estimate the future amount of any additional credit losses. The FASB recently issued guidance which will amend the accounting for credit losses. See Note 1 to the Financial Statements for additional discussion.  
  
   37 

As discussed above, the projection of cash flows expected to be collected on private label MBS involves significant judgment with respect to key modeling assumptions. Therefore, on all private label MBS, the Bank performed a cash flow analysis under one additional scenario which was agreed to by the OTTI Governance Committee that represented meaningful, plausible and more adverse external assumptions. This more adverse scenario decreases the short-term forecast by five percentage points, and slows housing price recovery rates 33%.     The adverse scenario estimated cash flows were generated using the same model (Prime, Alt-A or subprime) as the base scenario.  Using a model with more severe assumptions could increase the estimated credit loss recorded by the Bank. The securities included in this stress scenario were only those that were in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016  .  Additionally, the maximum credit loss under the adverse case was limited to the amount of the security's unrealized loss.  The adverse case housing price forecast is not management s current best estimate of cash flows and is therefore not used as a basis for determining OTTI.  The results of the analysis were immaterial. 

Credit and Counterparty Risk - Mortgage Loans, BOB Loans and Derivatives 
    
  Mortgage Loans.      The Finance Agency has authorized the Bank to hold mortgage loans under the MPF Program whereby the Bank acquires mortgage loans from participating members in a shared credit risk structure.  These assets carry CEs, which give them the approximate equivalent of a AA credit rating at the time of purchase by the Bank, although the CE is not actually rated.  The Bank had net mortgage loans held for portfolio of $3.3 billion and $3.1 billion at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, after an allowance for credit losses of   $6.5 million   and $5.7 million, respectively.  
    
  Mortgage Insurers.    The Bank s MPF Program currently has credit exposure to 10 mortgage insurance companies which provide PMI and/or Supplemental Mortgage Insurance (SMI) for the Bank s various products.  The Bank closely monitors the financial condition of these mortgage insurers.  PMI for MPF Program loans must be issued by a mortgage insurance company on the approved mortgage insurance company list whenever PMI coverage is required. 
    
  None of the Bank s mortgage insurers currently maintain a rating by at least one NRSRO of A or better.  Given the credit deterioration of PMI providers, the estimate of the allowance for credit losses includes projected reduced claim payments.  As required by the MPF Program, for originations with PMI, the ratings model currently requires additional CE from the PFI to compensate for the mortgage insurer rating when it is below A+. 
    
  The MPF Plus product required SMI under the MPF Program when each pool was established.  At   September 30, 2016  , seven of the 14 MPF Plus pools still have SMI policies in place.  The Bank does not currently offer the MPF Plus product and has not purchased loans under MPF Plus Commitments since July 2006.  Per MPF Program guidelines, the existing MPF Plus product exposure is required to be secured by the PFI once the SMI company is rated below AA-.  The Finance Agency guidelines require mortgage insurers that underwrite SMI to be rated AA- or better.  This requirement has been temporarily waived by the Finance Agency provided that the Bank otherwise mitigates the risk by requiring the PFI to secure the exposure.  As of   September 30, 2016  , $28.5 million of SMI exposure had been secured by two PFIs. 
    
  The unpaid principal balance and maximum coverage outstanding for seriously delinquent loans with PMI as of   September 30, 2016   was $8.2 million and $3.3 million, respectively.  As of   December 31, 2015  , the unpaid principal balance and maximum coverage outstanding for seriously delinquent loans with PMI amounts was $10.8 million and $4.4 million, respectively. 
    
    BOB Loans  . See Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting policies in Item 8 in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K for a description of the BOB program.  At   September 30, 2016  , the allowance for credit losses on BOB loans was   $2.0 million  , a decrease of $0.1 million from December 31, 2015. 
    
  Derivative Counterparties.    To manage market risk, the Bank enters into derivative contracts.  Derivative transactions may be either executed with a counterparty (referred to as uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent) or a Swap Execution Facility with a Derivatives Clearing Organization (referred to as cleared derivatives).  For uncleared derivatives, the Bank transacts most of its derivatives with large banks and major broker-dealers.  Some of these banks and broker-dealers or their affiliates buy, sell, and distribute consolidated obligations.  The Bank is not a derivatives dealer and does not trade derivatives for short-term profit. 
    
  The Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of non-performance by counterparties to its derivative transactions.  The amount of credit risk on derivatives depends on the extent to which netting procedures, collateral requirements and other credit enhancements are used and are effective in mitigating the risk.  The Bank manages credit risk through credit analysis, collateral management, and other credit enhancements. 
  
   38 

Uncleared Derivatives.    The Bank is subject to non-performance by counterparties to its uncleared derivative transactions. The Bank requires collateral on uncleared derivative transactions. The amount of net unsecured credit exposure that is permissible with respect to each counterparty depends on the credit rating of that counterparty. A counterparty must deliver collateral to the Bank if the total market value of the Bank's exposure to that counterparty rises above a specific trigger point. As a result of these risk mitigation initiatives, the Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its uncleared derivative transactions with counterparties as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
    Cleared Derivatives.    The Bank is subject to credit risk due to non-performance by the Clearing Houses and clearing agent. The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin, through the clearing agent, to the Clearing Houses, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearing Houses fail to meet their obligations. Initial margin is the amount calculated based on anticipated exposure to future changes in the value of a swap and protects the Clearing Houses from market risk in the event of default by one of its clearing agents.  Variation margin is the amount calculated to cover the current exposure arising from changes in the market value of the position since the trade was executed or the previous time the position was marked to market. The Bank's use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives through a clearing agent. The Bank does not anticipate any credit losses on its cleared derivatives as of   September 30, 2016  . 

39 

The contractual or notional amount of derivative transactions reflects the involvement of the Bank in the various classes of financial instruments. The maximum credit risk of the Bank with respect to derivative transactions is the estimated cost of replacing the derivative transactions if there is a default, minus the value of any related collateral, including initial and variation margin. In determining maximum credit risk, the Bank considers accrued interest receivables and payables as well as the netting requirements to net assets and liabilities. The following table presents the derivative positions with non-member counterparties and member institutions to which the Bank has credit exposure at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Notes: 
   (1)    This table does not reflect any changes in rating, outlook or watch status occurring after   September 30, 2016  . The ratings presented in this table represent the lowest long-term counterparty credit rating available for each counterparty based on the NRSROs used by the Bank. 
  
   40 

(2)    Represents derivative transactions cleared through Clearing Houses. 
   (3)    Member institutions include mortgage delivery commitments.  
    
  The following tables summarize the Bank s uncleared derivative counterparties which represent more than 10% of the Bank s total notional amount outstanding and net credit exposure as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Notes: 
   (1)    The percentage of notional was not greater than 10%. 
   (2)    The percentage of credit exposure was not greater than 10%. 
   (3)    The counterparty had no credit exposure for the period-end. 
    
  To manage market risk, the Bank enters into derivative contracts.  Some of the Bank's derivative transactions are made with U.S. branches of financial institutions located in Europe.  In terms of counterparty credit risk exposure, European financial institutions are exposed to the Bank as shown below. 

Note:   The average maturity of these derivative contracts is September 2021 at   September 30, 2016   and July 2019 at   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Collateral Obligation (Net Exposure) is defined as Market Value of Total Exposure minus delivery threshold and minimum collateral transfer requirements. 

41 

In addition, the Bank is exposed to counterparty credit risk with U.S. branches of European financial institutions, as presented in the tables below. 

Note:   The average maturity of these derivative contracts is January 2020 at   September 30, 2016   and November 2019 at December 31, 2015, respectively.  Collateral Obligation (Net Exposure) is defined as Market Value of Total Exposure minus delivery threshold and minimum collateral transfer requirements. 
    
  To appropriately assess potential credit risk to its European holdings, the Bank annually underwrites each counterparty and country and regularly monitors NRSRO rating actions and other publications for changes to credit quality.  The Bank also actively monitors its counterparties' approximate indirect exposure to European sovereign debt and considers this exposure as a component of its credit risk review process. 

Liquidity and Funding Risk    
    
  As a wholesale bank, the Bank employs financial strategies that are designed to enable it to expand and contract its assets, liabilities and capital in response to changes in member credit demand, membership composition and other market factors.  The Bank's liquidity resources are designed to support these strategies and are described further in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K.  
    
  The Bank is focused on maintaining a liquidity and funding balance between its financial assets and financial liabilities.  The FHLBanks and the OF jointly monitor the combined refinancing risk of the FHLBank System.  In managing and monitoring the amounts of assets that require refunding, the Bank may consider contractual maturities of the financial assets, as well as certain assumptions regarding expected cash flows (i.e., estimated prepayments and scheduled amortizations). 
    
  Consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes are rated Aaa with stable outlook/P-1 by Moody s and AA+ with stable outlook/A-1+ by S   P, as of   September 30, 2016  .  These ratings measure the likelihood of timely payment of principal and interest.  In April 2016, Moody's affirmed the Aaa senior debt and P-1 ratings of the FHLBank System and affirmed the Aaa bank deposit and P-1 ratings of all 11 FHLBanks and the A2 subordinated debt of FHLBank Chicago.  The outlook on the FHLBank System's and FHLBanks' ratings is stable. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank s consolidated obligation bonds outstanding increased to   $67.7 billion   compared to $48.6 billion at December 31, 2015.  The Bank also issues discount notes, which are shorter-term consolidated obligations, to support its short-term member loan portfolio and other short-term asset funding needs.  Total discount notes outstanding at   September 30, 2016   decreased to   $22.6 billion   compared to $42.3 billion at December 31, 2015.  Investor demand for certain structures shifted during the first nine months of 2016, which included increased demand for floating-rate and short-term, fixed-rate bonds.  In addition, the Bank reduced its refunding risk exposure by issuing longer term bonds. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, funding spreads (i.e., the cost of FHLBank debt relative to LIBOR), particularly short-term funding spreads, improved considerably. This development was driven by the impending implementation of new rules applicable to institutional money market funds. The reform measures, which took effect in October 2016, spurred an increase in both 3-month LIBOR and investor demand for FHLBank short-term consolidated obligations during the quarter.  The Bank primarily uses noncallable bonds as a source of funding but also utilizes structured notes such as callable bonds.  Unswapped callable bonds primarily fund the Bank s mortgage portfolio while swapped callable bonds fund other floating-rate assets.  At   September 30, 2016  , callable bonds issued by the Bank were down approximately $2.3 billion from December 31, 2015.  Note 10 - Consolidated Obligations to the unaudited financial statements in   this Form 10-Q   provides additional information regarding the Bank s consolidated obligations. 
    
  The Bank is required to maintain a level of liquidity in accordance with certain Finance Agency guidance and policies established by management and the Board. Under these policies and guidelines, the Bank is required to maintain sufficient liquidity in an amount at least equal to its anticipated net cash outflows under two different scenarios. One scenario assumes that the Bank cannot access the capital markets for a period of 15 days and that, during that time, members do not renew any  
  
   42 

maturing, prepaid and called advances. The second scenario assumes that the Bank cannot access the capital markets for five days and that, during that period, it will automatically renew maturing and called advances for all members except very large, highly rated members.  These requirements are designed to enhance the Bank s protection against temporary disruptions in access to the debt markets. Refer to the Liquidity and Funding Risk section in Item 7. of the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.  The Bank was in compliance with these requirements at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Contingency Liquidity.   In their asset/liability management planning, members may look to the Bank to provide standby liquidity. The Bank seeks to be in a position to meet its customers  credit and liquidity needs without maintaining excessive holdings of low-yielding liquid investments or being forced to incur unnecessarily high borrowing costs.  To satisfy these requirements and objectives, the Bank s primary sources of liquidity are the issuance of new consolidated obligation bonds and discount notes and short-term investments, such as Federal funds sold and overnight securities purchased under agreements to resell. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , excess contingency liquidity was approximately $19.5 billion and $20.8 billion, respectively.  
    
  Refer to the Liquidity and Funding Risk section in Item 7. of the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information.   
    
    Joint and Several Liability.    Although the Bank is primarily liable for its portion of consolidated obligations, (i.e., those issued on its behalf), the Bank is also jointly and severally liable with the other 10 FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on consolidated obligations of all the FHLBanks.  The Finance Agency, in its discretion and notwithstanding any other provisions, may at any time order any FHLBank to make principal or interest payments due on any consolidated obligation, even in the absence of default by the primary obligor. To the extent that an FHLBank makes any payment on a consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank, the paying FHLBank shall be entitled to reimbursement from the non-paying FHLBank, which has a corresponding obligation to reimburse the FHLBank to the extent of such assistance and other associated costs.  However, if the Finance Agency determines that the non-paying FHLBank is unable to satisfy its obligations, then the Finance Agency may allocate the outstanding liability among the remaining FHLBanks on a pro rata basis in proportion to each FHLBank s participation in all consolidated obligations outstanding, or on any other basis the Finance Agency may determine. Finance Agency regulations govern the issuance of debt on behalf of the FHLBanks and authorize the FHLBanks to issue consolidated obligations, through the OF as its agent.  The Bank is not permitted to issue individual debt without Finance Agency approval.  See Note 14 - Consolidated Obligations of the audited financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Financial Data in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K for additional information. 

Operating and Business Risks 
    
  Operating Risk.   Operating risk is defined as the risk of unexpected loss resulting from human error, system malfunctions, man-made or natural disasters, fraud, legal risk, compliance risk, or circumvention or failure of internal controls. The Bank has established operating policies and procedures to manage each of the specific operating risks which are categorized as financial reporting, compliance, fraud, legal, information and personnel. 
    
  Business Risk.    Business risk is the risk of an adverse impact on the Bank s profitability or financial or business strategies resulting from external factors that may occur in the short-term and/or long-term. This risk includes the potential for strategic business constraints to be imposed through regulatory, legislative or political changes. The Bank s Risk Management Committee monitors economic indicators and the external environment in which the Bank operates and attempts to mitigate this risk through long-term strategic planning. For additional information, on operating and business risks, see the "Operating and Business Risks" discussion in the Risk Management section of Item 7. in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K.

  Notes to Financial Statements (  unaudited  ) 
    
  Background Information 
    
  The Bank, a federally chartered corporation, is one of   11   district Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks).  The FHLBanks are government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) that serve the public by increasing the availability of credit for residential mortgages and community development. The Bank provides a readily available, low-cost source of funds to its member institutions. The Bank is a cooperative, which means that current members own nearly all of the outstanding capital stock of the Bank. All holders of the Bank s capital stock may, to the extent declared by the Board, receive dividends on their capital stock. Regulated financial depositories and insurance companies engaged in residential housing finance that maintain their principal place of business (as defined by Finance Agency regulation) in Delaware, Pennsylvania or West Virginia may apply for membership.  Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) which meet membership regulation standards are also eligible to become Bank members. State and local housing associates that meet certain statutory and regulatory criteria may also borrow from the Bank. While eligible to borrow, state and local housing associates are not members of the Bank and, as such, are not required to hold capital stock. 
    
  All members must purchase stock in the Bank. The amount of capital stock a member owns is based on membership requirements (membership asset value) and activity requirements (i.e., outstanding advances, letters of credit, and the principal balance of certain residential mortgage loans sold to the Bank). The Bank considers those members with capital stock outstanding in excess of   10%   of total capital stock outstanding to be related parties. See Note 12 - Transactions with Related Parties for additional information. 
    
  The Federal Housing Finance Agency (Finance Agency) is the independent regulator of the FHLBanks. The mission of the Finance Agency is to ensure the FHLBanks operate in a safe and sound manner so they serve as a reliable source for liquidity and funding for housing finance and community investment.  Each FHLBank operates as a separate entity with its own management, employees and board of directors. The Bank does not consolidate any off-balance sheet special-purpose entities or other conduits. 
    
  As provided by the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (FHLBank Act) or Finance Agency regulation, the Bank s debt instruments, referred to as consolidated obligations, are the joint and several obligations of all the FHLBanks and are the primary source of funds for the FHLBanks. These funds are primarily used to provide advances, purchase mortgages from members through the MPF Program and purchase certain investments. See Note 10 - Consolidated Obligations for additional information.  The Office of Finance (OF) is a joint office of the FHLBanks established to facilitate the issuance and servicing of the consolidated obligations of the FHLBanks and to prepare the combined quarterly and annual financial reports of all 11 FHLBanks.  Deposits, other borrowings, and capital stock issued to members provide other funds. The Bank primarily invests these funds in short-term investments to provide liquidity. The Bank also provides member institutions with correspondent services, such as wire transfer, safekeeping and settlement with the Federal Reserve. 
    
  The accounting and financial reporting policies of the Bank conform to U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Preparation of the unaudited financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. In addition, from time to time certain amounts in the prior period may be reclassified to conform to the current presentation. To the extent that any reclassifications were made, the reclassifications did not have a material impact on the Bank's financial statements. In the opinion of management, all normal recurring adjustments have been included for a fair statement of this interim financial information. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K.

Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

Note 1   Accounting Adjustments, Changes in Accounting Principle and Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Interpretations 
    
    Statement of Cash Flows.   In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) focused on reducing diversity in practice in the Statement of Cash Flows by providing clarification on eight issues involving classification in this financial statement. The Bank is evaluating the impact of this guidance, which will be effective for the Bank no later than January 1, 2018. 
    
  Credit Losses.   In June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU which amends the accounting for credit losses on financial instruments. The ASU will eliminate the incurred loss model and implement a new model based on expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. The Bank is evaluating the impact of this guidance and will assess its impact, if any, on all of the Bank s financial assets, including advances, MPF loans, BOB loans, repurchase agreements, and AFS and HTM securities. This guidance will be effective for the Bank no later than January 1, 2020. 
    
    Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments.   In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to eliminate diversity in practice when determining whether the economic characteristics of an embedded put or call option in a debt instrument are clearly and closely related to the debt host. The Bank expects its embedded derivatives to continue to not require bifurcation as a result of this guidance, which will be effective for the Bank no later than January 1, 2017. 
    
    Derivative Novations.   In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies that a change in the counterparty to a derivative contract, in and of itself, does not require the dedesignation of the hedge relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. This position is consistent with the SEC staff s position on novations, as well as the Bank s practice. The guidance was early-adopted by the Bank as of January 1, 2016 and had no impact on the Bank. 
    
  Leases.   In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends the accounting for leases. This guidance will require lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for virtually all leases, other than short-term leases. The Bank is evaluating the impact of this guidance, which will be effective for the Bank no later than January 1, 2019. 
    
    Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities.   In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends existing guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Although many of the existing requirements are not changed, this guidance revises the accounting for equity securities, financial liabilities measured under the fair value option, and certain disclosure requirements for fair value of financial instruments. The Bank is evaluating the impact of this guidance, which will be effective for the Bank beginning January 1, 2018. 
    
    Cloud Computing Arrangements.   In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which clarifies circumstances under which a cloud computing arrangement should be accounted for as a license of internal-use software as opposed to a service contract. This guidance was effective for the Bank beginning January 1, 2016 and did not impact the Bank's financial condition or results of operations. 
    
    Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance which requires the Bank to present debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the related debt on the Statement of Condition, consistent with debt discounts. This guidance was effective for the Bank beginning January 1, 2016 and was applied retrospectively, resulting in an immaterial reclassification of debt issuance costs from Other Assets to Consolidated Obligations in the Bank's Statement of Condition. 
    
    Consolidation.   In February 2015, the FASB issued amendments to its existing consolidation guidance.  This guidance was effective for the Bank beginning January 1, 2016 and did not impact the Bank's financial condition. 
    
    Extraordinary Items.   In January 2015, the FASB issued guidance which eliminates the concept of extraordinary items. As a result, preparers and auditors no longer need to determine whether an event is extraordinary. However, the guidance continues to require separate presentation on the Statement of Income for items that are both unusual and infrequent. This guidance was effective for the Bank beginning January 1, 2016 and did not impact the Bank s results of operations. 
    
  Going Concern  .   In August 2014, the FASB issued guidance which requires all entities to perform an interim and annual assessment of their ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date of issuance of their respective financial statements. The guidance also requires disclosures if there is  substantial doubt  of the entity s ability to continue as a going concern.  The Bank's initial quarterly assessment will be completed as of its December 31, 2016 financial statements. 
  
   52 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers.   In May 2014, the FASB issued revised guidance for revenue recognition. This guidance will increase comparability across industries by providing a single, comprehensive revenue recognition model for all contracts with customers. The guidance will require recognition of revenue to reflect the economics of the transaction and will require expanded disclosures regarding revenue recognition. This guidance, which will be effective for the Bank beginning January 1, 2018, is not expected to materially impact the Bank's financial condition or results of operations. 
    
  Framework for Adversely Classifying Loans, Other Real Estate Owned, and Other Assets and Listing Assets for Special Mention.    In April 2012, the Finance Agency issued Advisory Bulletin 2012-02, Framework for Adversely Classifying Loans, Other Real Estate Owned, and Other Assets and Listing Assets for Special Mention (AB 2012-02 or Advisory Bulletin). The Advisory Bulletin established guidelines for adverse classification of various assets, primarily MPF loans at the Bank, and required the Bank to charge-off the portion of the loan classified as a  loss.  The Bank implemented the classification provisions on January 1, 2014.  During the first quarter 2014, the Bank incorporated estimates of fair values on loans as applicable under the Advisory Bulletin in its calculation of the required  loss  on MPF loans. The Bank adopted the charge-off provisions of the Advisory Bulletin on January 1, 2015. The adoption of the Advisory Bulletin did not have a material impact on the Bank s financial condition or results of operations. 

Note 2   Trading Securities 
    
  The following table presents trading securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

The mutual funds are held in a Rabbi trust to generate returns that seek to offset changes in liabilities related to market risk of certain deferred compensation agreements. These deferred compensation liabilities were   $6.8 million   and   $5.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in Other liabilities in the Statement of Condition. 
    
  The following table presents net gains (losses) on trading securities for the   third quarter   and the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  .

Note 3   Available-for-Sale (AFS) Securities 
    
  The following tables present AFS securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Notes  : 
   (1)    Amortized cost includes adjustments made to the cost basis of an investment for accretion of discounts and/or amortization of premiums, collection of cash, previous OTTI recognized in earnings, and/or fair value hedge accounting adjustments. 
   (2)    Represents the non-credit portion of an OTTI recognized during the life of the security. 
    
  The Bank has established a Rabbi trust to secure a portion of the Bank's benefit obligation under its supplemental retirement plan. The Rabbi trust assets are invested in mutual funds. These obligations were   $7.2 million   and   $6.7 million     September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are included in Other liabilities in the Statement of Condition. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the amortized cost of the Bank s MBS classified as AFS included net purchased discounts of   $14.0 million  , credit losses of   $194.3 million   and OTTI-related accretion adjustments of   $38.6 million  . As of   December 31, 2015  , these amounts were   $9.7 million  ,   $205.9 million   and   $31.5 million  , respectively.

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table presents a reconciliation of the AFS OTTI loss recognized through AOCI to the total net non-credit portion of OTTI gains on AFS securities in AOCI as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

The following tables summarize the AFS securities with unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The unrealized losses are aggregated by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position.  

Note: 
   (1)    Total unrealized losses equal the sum of  OTTI Recognized in AOCI  and  Gross Unrealized Losses  in the first two tables of this Note 3. 

55 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

Securities Transferred.    The Bank may transfer investment securities from HTM to AFS when an OTTI credit loss has been recorded on the security.  The Bank believes that a credit loss constitutes evidence of a significant decline in the issuer s creditworthiness.  The Bank transfers these securities to increase its flexibility to sell the securities if management determines it is prudent to do so.  Refer to description in Note 4 - Held-to-Maturity Securities.  There were   no   transfers during the first nine months of 2016.  The Bank transferred   one   private label MBS from HTM to AFS during the second quarter of 2015, which is the period in which an OTTI credit loss was recorded on the security.  The amortized cost, OTTI recognized in OCI, and the fair value of the security transferred were   $4.4 million  ,   $(1.0) million  , and   $3.4 million  , respectively.  There were no other transfers during the first nine months of 2015. 
    
  Redemption Terms.   The amortized cost and fair value of AFS securities by contractual maturity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented below. Expected maturities of some securities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees. 

Interest Rate Payment Terms.    The following table details interest payment terms at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Realized Gains (Losses) on AFS Securities.   The following table provides a summary of proceeds, gross gains and losses on sales of AFS securities for the three and nine months ended 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

56 

Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

Note 4   Held-to-Maturity (HTM) Securities 
    
  The following tables present HTM securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

57 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

The following tables summarize the HTM securities with unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The unrealized losses are aggregated by major security type and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position. 

Securities Transferred.    There were no transfers of private label MBS from HTM to AFS during the first nine months of 2016.  The Bank transferred one private label MBS from HTM to AFS during the second quarter of 2015. There were no other transfers during the first nine months of 2015  See Note 3 - Available-for-Sale Securities for additional information. 
    
  Changes in circumstances may cause the Bank to change its intent to hold a certain security to maturity without calling into question its intent to hold other debt securities to maturity in the future. Thus, the transfer or sale of an HTM security due to certain changes in circumstances, such as evidence of significant deterioration in the issuer s creditworthiness or changes in regulatory requirements, is not considered to be inconsistent with its original classification. Other events that are isolated, nonrecurring, and unusual for the Bank that could not have been reasonably anticipated may cause the Bank to transfer or sell an HTM security without necessarily calling into question its intent to hold other debt securities to maturity. 

58 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

Redemption Terms.   The amortized cost and fair value of HTM securities by contractual maturity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented below. Expected maturities of some securities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment fees. 

Interest Rate Payment Terms.   The following table details interest rate payment terms at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Note 5   Other-Than-Temporary Impairment (OTTI) 
    
  The Bank evaluates its individual AFS and HTM securities in an unrealized loss position for OTTI on a quarterly basis. The Bank assesses whether there is OTTI by performing an analysis to determine if any securities will incur a credit loss, the amount of which could be up to the difference between the security's amortized cost basis and its fair value, and records any difference in its Statement of Income.  For information on the Bank s accounting for OTTI, see Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the audited financial statements in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K.  For information about how the Bank projects cash flows expected to be collected, see Note 7 - Other-than-Temporary Impairment     Analysis to the audited financial statements in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  A significant input to the projection of cash flows expected to be collected is the forecast of future housing price changes for the relevant states and core-based statistical areas (CBSAs) which is based upon an assessment of the individual housing markets.  During the   third quarter   of 2016, the OTTI Governance Committee developed a short-term housing price forecast using whole percentages with changes ranging from   (1.0)%   to   10.0%   over the   12   month period beginning July 1, 2016. For the vast majority of markets the short-term forecast has changes from   3.0%   to   6.0%  .  Thereafter, a unique path is projected for each geographic area based on an internally developed framework derived from historical data. 

59 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

All of the Bank's other-than-temporarily impaired securities were classified as AFS as of   September 30, 2016  . The "Total OTTI securities" balances below summarize the Bank s securities as of   September 30, 2016   for which an OTTI has been recognized during the life of the security. The "Private label MBS with no OTTI" balances below represent AFS securities on which an OTTI was not taken. The sum of these two amounts reflects the total AFS private label MBS balance. 

Notes: 
   (1)    Amortized cost includes adjustments made to the cost basis of an investment for accretion of discounts and/or amortization of premiums, collection of cash, and/or previous OTTI recognized in earnings. 
    
  The following table presents the rollforward of the amounts related to OTTI credit losses recognized during the life of the security for which a portion of the OTTI charges was recognized in AOCI for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

Notes: 
   (1)    For the three months ended September 30, additional OTTI credit losses for which an OTTI charge was previously recognized relates to all securities that were also previously impaired prior to July 1 of that year. For the nine months ended September 30, additional OTTI credit losses for which an OTTI charge was previously recognized relates to all securities that were also previously impaired prior to January 1 of that year.  
   (2)    Represents reductions related to securities sold or having reached final maturity during the period, and therefore are no longer held by the Bank at the end of the period. 
    
  All Other AFS and HTM Investments.   At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank held certain securities in an unrealized loss position. These unrealized losses were considered to be temporary as the Bank expects to recover the entire amortized cost basis on the remaining securities in unrealized loss positions based on the creditworthiness of the underlying creditor, guarantor, or implicit government support, and the Bank neither intends to sell these securities nor considers it more likely than not that the Bank would be required to sell any such security before its anticipated recovery. As a result, the Bank did not consider any of these other investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  .

Note 6   Advances 
    
  General Terms.   The Bank offers fixed- and variable-rate advance products with different maturities, interest rates, payment characteristics and optionality. Fixed-rate advances generally have maturities ranging from   one day   to   30 years  . Variable-rate advances generally have maturities ranging from less than 30 days to   ten   years and the interest rates reset periodically at a fixed spread to LIBOR or other specified indices. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had advances outstanding, including AHP advances, with interest rates ranging from   0.34%   to   7.40%  .  AHP subsidized advances have interest rates ranging from   2.00%   to   5.50%  . 
    
  The following table details the Bank s advances portfolio by year of contractual maturity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

The Bank also offers convertible advances. Convertible advances allow the Bank to convert an advance from one interest rate structure to another. When issuing convertible advances, the Bank may purchase put options from a member that allow the Bank to convert the fixed-rate advance to a variable-rate advance at the current market rate or another structure after an agreed-upon lockout period. A convertible advance carries a lower interest rate than a comparable-maturity fixed-rate advance without the conversion feature. Variable to fixed-rate convertible advances have a defined lockout period during which the interest rates adjust based on a spread to LIBOR. At the end of the lockout period, these advances may convert to fixed-rate advances. The fixed rates on the converted advances are determined at origination.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had convertible advances outstanding of   $0.7 billion   and   $1.5 billion  , respectively. 
    
  The Bank offers certain advances to members that   provide a member the right, based upon predetermined exercise dates, to prepay the advance prior to maturity   without incurring prepayment or termination fees (returnable advances).  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had   $12.5 billion   and   $12.6 billion   of returnable advances, respectively.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank did not have any advances with embedded features that met the requirements to separate the embedded feature from the host contract and designate the embedded feature as a stand-alone derivative.

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table summarizes advances by the earlier of (i) year of contractual maturity or next call date and (ii) year of contractual maturity or next convertible date as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Interest Rate Payment Terms.    The following table details interest rate payment terms for advances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Credit Risk Exposure and Security Terms.   The Bank s potential credit risk from advances is concentrated in commercial banks and savings institutions. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had advances of   $55.0 billion   outstanding to the five largest borrowers, which represented   76.6%   of total advances outstanding. Of these   five  ,   three   had outstanding advance balances that were each in excess of   10%   of the total portfolio at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had advances of   $55.1 billion   outstanding to the five largest borrowers, which represented   74.1%   of total advances outstanding. Of these   five  ,   four   had outstanding advance balances that were each in excess of   10%   of the total portfolio at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  See Note 8 for information related to the Bank's allowance for credit losses.

Note 7   Mortgage Loans Held for Portfolio 
    
  Under the MPF Program, the Bank invests in mortgage loans that it purchases from its participating members and housing associates. The Bank s participating members originate, service, and credit enhance residential mortgage loans that are sold to the Bank. See Note 12 for further information regarding transactions with related parties. 
    
  The following table presents balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   for mortgage loans held for portfolio. 

Note: 
   (1)    Long-term is defined as greater than 15 years. Medium-term is defined as a term of 15 years or less.  
    
  The following table details the par value of mortgage loans held for portfolio outstanding categorized by type as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

See Note 8 - Allowance for Credit Losses for information related to the Bank's credit risk on mortgage loans and allowance for credit losses. 

Note 8   Allowance for Credit Losses 
    
  The Bank has established an allowance methodology for each of the Bank s portfolio segments: credit products, government-guaranteed or insured mortgage loans held for portfolio, conventional MPF loans held for portfolio, and BOB loans.  
    
  Credit Products  .   The Bank manages its total credit exposure (TCE), which includes advances, letters of credit, advance commitments, and other credit product exposure, through an integrated approach.  This approach generally calls for a credit limit to be established for each borrower, includes an ongoing review of each borrower s financial condition and is coupled with collateral and lending policies to limit risk of loss while balancing each borrower's need for a reliable source of funding.  In addition, the Bank lends to its members in accordance with the     FHLBank     Act and Finance Agency regulations. Specifically, the FHLBank Act requires the Bank to obtain collateral to fully secure credit products. The estimated value of the collateral required to secure each member s credit products is calculated by applying collateral weightings, or haircuts, to the value of the collateral. The Bank accepts cash, certain investment securities, residential mortgage loans, deposits, and other real estate related assets as collateral. In addition, Community Financial Institutions (CFIs) are eligible to utilize expanded statutory collateral provisions for small business, agriculture, and community development loans. The Bank s capital stock owned by the borrowing member is pledged as secondary collateral. Collateral arrangements may vary depending upon borrower credit quality, financial condition and performance, borrowing capacity, and overall credit exposure to the borrower. The Bank can require additional or substitute collateral to help ensure that credit products continue to be secured by adequate collateral.  Management of the Bank believes that these policies effectively manage the Bank s credit risk from credit products.  
    
  Based upon the financial condition of the member, the Bank either allows a member to retain physical possession of the collateral assigned to the Bank or requires the member to specifically deliver physical possession or control of the collateral to the Bank or its custodians. However, regardless of the member's financial condition, the Bank always takes possession or control of securities used as collateral if they are used for maximum borrowing capacity (MBC) or to secure advances.  The  
  
   63 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

Bank perfects its security interest in all pledged collateral. The FHLBank Act affords any security interest granted to the Bank by a member (or an affiliate of a member) priority over the claims or rights of any other party, except for claims or rights of a third party that would be otherwise entitled to priority under applicable law and that are held by a bona fide purchaser for value or by a secured party holding a prior perfected security interest.  
    
  Using a risk-based approach, the Bank considers the payment status, collateral types and concentration levels, and borrower s financial condition to be indicators of credit quality on its credit products. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had rights to collateral on a member-by-member basis with a value in excess of its outstanding extensions of credit.  
    
  The Bank continues to evaluate and, as necessary, make changes to its collateral guidelines based on current market conditions. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank did not have any credit products that were past due, on nonaccrual status, or considered impaired. In addition, the Bank did not have any credit products considered to be troubled debt restructurings (TDRs). 
    
  Based upon the collateral held as security, its credit extension policies, collateral policies, management s credit analysis and the repayment history on credit products, the Bank has not incurred any credit losses on credit products since inception.  Accordingly, the Bank has not recorded any allowance for credit losses for these products.  
    
  Mortgage     Loans     - Government-Guaranteed or Insured.   The Bank invests in government-guaranteed or insured fixed-rate mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family residential properties. Government-guaranteed mortgage loans are those insured or guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Rural Housing Service (RHS) of the Department of Agriculture and/or by Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Any losses from such loans are expected to be recovered from those entities.  If not, losses from such loans must be contractually absorbed by the servicers.  Therefore, there is no allowance for credit losses on government-guaranteed or insured mortgage loans.  
    
  Mortgage Loans - Conventional MPF.   The allowances for conventional loans are determined by analyses that include consideration of various data observations such as past performance, current performance, loan portfolio characteristics, collateral-related characteristics, industry data, and prevailing economic conditions. The measurement of the allowance for credit losses includes: (1) reviewing all residential mortgage loans at the individual master commitment level; (2) reviewing specifically identified collateral-dependent loans for impairment; and/or (3) reviewing homogeneous pools of residential mortgage loans.  
    
  The Bank s allowance for credit losses takes into consideration the credit enhancement (CE) associated with conventional mortgage loans under the MPF Program. Specifically, the determination of the allowance generally considers expected Primary Mortgage Insurance (PMI), Supplemental Mortgage Insurance (SMI), and other CE amounts.  Any incurred losses that are expected to be recovered from the CE reduce the Bank s allowance for credit losses.  
    
  For conventional MPF loans, credit losses that are not fully covered by PMI are allocated to the Bank up to an agreed-upon amount, referred to as the first loss account (FLA). The FLA functions as a tracking mechanism for determining the point after which the participating financial institution (PFI) is required to cover losses. The Bank pays the PFI a fee, a portion of which may be based on the credit performance of the mortgage loans, in exchange for absorbing the second layer of losses up to an agreed-upon CE amount. The CE amount may be a direct obligation of the PFI and/or an SMI policy paid for by the PFI, and may include performance-based fees which can be withheld to cover losses allocated to the Bank (referred to as recaptured CE fees).  The PFI is required to pledge collateral to secure any portion of its CE amount that is a direct obligation.  A receivable which is assessed for collectability is generally established for losses expected to be recovered by withholding CE fees.  Estimated losses exceeding the CE, if any, are incurred by the Bank.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the MPF exposure under the FLA was   $23.4 million   and   $22.7 million  , respectively. The Bank records CE fees paid to PFIs as a reduction to mortgage loan interest income. The Bank incurred CE fees of   $0.8 million   for both the third quarter of   2016   and   2015   and   $2.3 million   for both the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
    
  Individually Evaluated Mortgage Loans.   The Bank evaluates certain conventional mortgage loans for impairment individually. Prior to January 1, 2014, these loans were limited to TDRs. Beginning January 1, 2014, the Bank adopted the classification provisions required by AB 2012-02 as described in Note 1 -Accounting Adjustments, Changes in Accounting Principle and Recently Issued Accounting Standards and Interpretations. As a result, the population of individually evaluated mortgage loans expanded to include impaired loans considered collateral-dependent loans where repayment is expected to be provided by the sale of the underlying property, which primarily consists of MPF loans that are 180 days or more delinquent and other loans where the borrower has filed for bankruptcy.

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

The estimated credit losses on impaired collateral-dependent loans are separately determined because sufficient information exists to make a reasonable estimate of the inherent loss for such loans on an individual basis. The incurred loss on each loan is equal to the difference between the carrying value of the loan and the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs and recovery through PMI. The estimated fair value is determined based on a value provided by a third party's retail-based Automated Valuation Model (AVM). The Bank adjusts the AVM based on the amount it has historically received on liquidations.  The resulting loss is reduced by available CE. The estimated credit loss on individually evaluated MPF loans is charged-off against the reserve. However, if the estimated loss can be recovered through CE, a receivable is established, resulting in a net charge-off. The CE receivable is evaluated for collectibility, and a reserve, included as part of the allowance for credit losses, is established if required.  
    
  Collectively Evaluated Mortgage Loans.    For the remainder of the portfolio, the Bank evaluates the homogeneous mortgage loan portfolio collectively for impairment. The allowance for credit loss methodology for mortgage loans considers loan pool specific attribute data, applies loss severities and incorporates the CEs of the MPF Program and PMI.  The probability of default and loss given default are based on the actual 12-month historical performance of the Bank s mortgage loans.  Actual probability of default was determined by applying migration analysis to categories of mortgage loans (current, 30 days past due, 60 days past due, and 90 days past due).  Actual loss given default was determined based on realized losses incurred on the sale of mortgage loan collateral over the previous 12 months. The resulting estimated losses are reduced by the CEs the Bank expects to be eligible to receive. The CEs are contractually set and calculated by a master commitment agreement between the Bank and the PFI.  Losses in excess of the CEs are incurred by the Bank.

BOB Loans.    Both the probability of default and loss given default are determined and used to estimate the allowance for credit losses on BOB loans. Loss given default is considered to be 100% due to the fact that the BOB program has no collateral or credit enhancement requirements.  The probability of default is based on the actual performance of the BOB program. The Bank considers BOB loans that are delinquent to be nonperforming assets.

  TDRs.   TDRs are considered to have occurred when a concession is granted to the debtor that would not have been considered had it not been for economic or legal reasons related to the debtor's financial difficulties.  
    
  Mortgage Loans - Conventional MPF.   The Bank offers a loan modification program for its MPF Program.  The loans modified under this program are considered TDRs.  The Bank also considers a TDR to have occurred when a borrower files for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the bankruptcy court discharges the borrower s obligation, and the borrower does not reaffirm the debt.      The recorded investment in mortgage loans classified as TDRs was   $15.1 million   and   $16.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The financial amounts related to TDRs are not material to the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  BOB Loans.   The Bank offers a BOB loan deferral which the Bank considers a TDR. A deferred BOB loan is not required to pay principal or accrue interest for a period up to one year. The credit loss is measured by factoring expected shortfalls incurred as of the reporting date. BOB loan TDRs are not material to the Bank s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Real Estate Owned (REO)  . The Bank had   $5.2 million   and   $6.5 million   of REO reported in Other assets on the Statement of Condition at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Purchases, Sales and Reclassifications.   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were no significant purchases or sales of financing receivables. Furthermore, none of the financing receivables were reclassified to held-for-sale. 

Note 9   Derivatives and Hedging Activities 
    
  Nature of Business Activity.   The Bank is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from the effect of interest rate changes on its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities that finance these assets. The goal of the Bank's interest rate risk management strategy is not to eliminate interest rate risk but to manage it within appropriate limits. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Bank has established policies and procedures which include guidelines on the amount of exposure to interest rate changes it is willing to accept. In addition, the Bank monitors the risk to its interest income, net interest margin and average maturity of interest-earning assets and funding sources.  For additional information on the Bank's derivative transactions, see Note 11 to the audited financial statements in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Derivative transactions may be executed either with a counterparty (referred to as uncleared derivatives) or cleared through a Futures Commission Merchant (i.e., clearing agent) or a Swap Execution Facility with a Derivatives Clearing Organization (referred to as cleared derivatives).  Once a derivative transaction has been accepted for clearing by a Derivative Clearing Organization (Clearing House), the derivative transaction is novated and the executing counterparty is replaced with the Clearing House. The Bank is not a derivatives dealer and does not trade derivatives for short-term profit. For uncleared derivatives, the Bank transacts most of its derivatives with large banks and major broker-dealers. Some of these banks and broker-dealers or their affiliates buy, sell, and distribute consolidated obligations.

These amounts do not include   $(1.5) million   and   $(1.2) million   for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $(3.9) million   and   $1.7 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of amortization/accretion of the basis adjustment related to discontinued fair value hedging relationships. 
    
  The Bank had no active cash flow hedging relationships during the first nine months of   2016   or   2015  . 
    
  Managing Credit Risk on Derivatives.   The Bank is subject to credit risk due to the risk of nonperformance by counterparties to its derivative transactions. The Bank manages counterparty credit risk through credit analysis, collateral requirements, and adherence to the requirements set forth in its policies, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission regulations, and Finance Agency regulations.  For uncleared derivatives, the degree of credit risk depends on the extent to which netting arrangements are included in such contracts to mitigate the risk. The Bank requires collateral agreements with collateral delivery thresholds on all uncleared derivatives.  
    
  For cleared derivatives, the Clearing Houses are the Bank's counterparties. The Clearing House notifies the clearing agent of the required initial and variation margin.  The requirement that the Bank post initial and variation margin through the clearing agent, which notifies the FHLBank on behalf of the Clearing Houses, exposes the Bank to institutional credit risk in the event that the clearing agent or the Clearing Houses fail to meet their respective obligations.  Initial margin is the amount calculated based on anticipated exposure to future changes in the value of a swap and protects the Clearing Houses from market risk in the event of default by one of their respective clearing agents.  Variation margin is the amount calculated to cover the current exposure arising from changes in the market value of the position since the trade was executed or the previous time the position was marked to market.   
    
  The use of cleared derivatives is intended to mitigate credit risk exposure because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral is posted daily, through a clearing agent, for changes in the fair value of cleared derivatives. The Bank has analyzed the enforceability of offsetting rights incorporated in its cleared derivative transactions and determined that the exercise of those offsetting rights by a non-defaulting party under these transactions should be upheld under applicable law upon an event of default including a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding involving the Clearing Houses or the Bank s clearing agent, or both. Based on this analysis, the Bank presents a net derivative receivable or payable for all of its transactions through a particular clearing agent with a particular Clearing House. 
    
  Based on credit analyses and collateral requirements, the Bank does not anticipate credit losses related to its derivative agreements. See Note 13 - Estimated Fair Values for discussion regarding the Bank's fair value methodology for derivative assets and liabilities, including an evaluation of the potential for the fair value of these instruments to be affected by counterparty credit risk. 
    
  Generally, the Bank s ISDA agreements for uncleared derivatives contain provisions that require the Bank to post additional collateral with its counterparties if there is deterioration in the Bank's credit rating and the net liability position exceeds the relevant threshold. If the Bank s credit rating is lowered by a major credit rating agency, the Bank would be  
  
   71 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

required to deliver additional collateral on uncleared derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all uncleared derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position (before cash collateral and related accrued interest) at   September 30, 2016   was   $48.3 million  , for which the Bank has posted cash collateral with a fair value of approximately   $38.5 million  . If the Bank s credit rating had been lowered one notch (i.e., from its current rating to the next lower rating), the Bank would have been required to deliver up to an additional   $6.6 million   of collateral to its derivative counterparties at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  For cleared derivatives, the Clearing House determines initial margin requirements and generally credit ratings are not factored into the initial margin. However, clearing agents may require additional initial margin to be posted based on credit considerations, including but not limited to credit rating downgrades. The Bank was not required by its clearing agents to post additional initial margin at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Offsetting of Derivative Assets and Derivative Liabilities  .   When it has met the netting requirements, the     Bank presents derivative instruments, related cash collateral (including initial and variation margin) received or pledged, and associated accrued interest on a net basis by clearing agent and/or by counterparty.  The following tables present separately the fair value of derivative instruments meeting or not meeting netting requirements, including the related collateral received from or pledged to counterparties.

Note 10   Consolidated Obligations 
    
  Consolidated obligations consist of consolidated bonds and discount notes. The Bank records as a liability its specific portion of consolidated obligations for which it is the primary obligor.  Although the Bank is primarily liable for its portion of consolidated obligations, the Bank is also jointly and severally liable with the other ten FHLBanks for the payment of principal and interest on all consolidated obligations of each of the FHLBanks. The Finance Agency, at its discretion, may require any FHLBank to make principal or interest payments due on any consolidated obligations whether or not the consolidated obligation represents a primary liability of such FHLBank. 
  Although an FHLBank has never paid the principal or interest payments due on a consolidated obligation on behalf of another FHLBank, if one FHLBank is required to make such payments on behalf of another FHLBank, Finance Agency regulations provide that the paying FHLBank is entitled to reimbursement from the non-complying FHLBank for any payments made on its behalf and other associated costs including interest to be determined by the Finance Agency. However, if the Finance Agency determines that the non-complying FHLBank is unable to satisfy its repayment obligations, then the Finance Agency may allocate the outstanding liabilities of the non-complying FHLBank among the remaining FHLBanks on a pro rata basis in proportion to each FHLBank s participation in all consolidated obligations outstanding. The Finance Agency reserves the right to allocate the outstanding liabilities for the consolidated obligations among the FHLBanks in any other manner it may determine to ensure that the FHLBanks operate in a safe and sound manner.  The par amounts of the FHLBanks  outstanding consolidated obligations were     $967.7 billion     and     $905.2 billion   at     September 30, 2016     and     December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Additional detailed information regarding consolidated obligations including general terms and interest rate payment terms can be found in Note 14 to the audited financial statements in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K.

Note 11   Capital 
    
  The Bank is subject to   three   capital requirements under its current Capital Plan Structure and the Finance Agency rules and regulations: (1) risk-based capital; (2) total regulatory capital; and (3) leverage capital. Regulatory capital does not include AOCI, but does include mandatorily redeemable capital stock.  See details regarding these requirements and the Bank s Capital Plan in Note 16 to the audited financial statements in the Bank s 2015 Form 10-K.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank was in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements. 
    
  The Bank has   two   subclasses of capital stock: B1 membership stock and B2 activity stock.  The Bank had   $0.3 billion   and   $3.2 billion   in B1 membership stock and B2 activity stock at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table demonstrates the Bank s compliance with the regulatory capital requirements at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

When the Finance Agency implemented the prompt corrective action provisions of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (Housing Act), it established four capital classifications for the FHLBanks: adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.  On September 20, 2016, the Bank received final notification from the Finance Agency that it was considered "adequately capitalized" for the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  As of the date of this filing, the Bank has not received final notice from the Finance Agency regarding its capital classification for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Capital Concentrations.   The following tables present member holdings of   10%   or more of the Bank s total capital stock, including mandatorily redeemable capital stock, outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Note: 
   (1)    For Bank membership purposes, the principal place of business for PNC Bank is Pittsburgh, PA. For Ally Bank, the principal place of business is Horsham, PA. 
    
  Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock.   Each FHLBank is a cooperative whose member financial institutions and former members own all of the relevant FHLBank's issued and outstanding capital stock. Shares cannot be purchased or sold except between an FHLBank and its members at the shares' par value of   $100  , as mandated by each FHLBank's capital plan. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had   $5.4 million   and   $6.0 million  , respectively, in capital stock subject to mandatory redemption with payment subject to a   five  -year waiting period and the Bank meeting its minimum regulatory capital requirements.  Estimated dividends on mandatorily redeemable capital stock recorded as interest expense were immaterial during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

76 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

The following table provides the related dollar amounts for activities recorded in mandatorily redeemable capital stock during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the total mandatorily redeemable capital stock reflected the balance for   three   institutions.    Two   institutions were merged out of district and are considered to be non-members.    One   other institution has notified the Bank of its intention to voluntary redeem its capital stock and withdraw from membership.  This institution will continue to be a member of the Bank until the withdrawal period is completed. 
    
  The following table shows the amount of mandatorily redeemable capital stock by contractual year of redemption at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

The year of redemption in the table above is the end of the five-year redemption period for the mandatorily redeemable capital stock. Under the terms of the Bank s Capital Plan, membership capital stock is redeemable five years from the date of membership termination or withdrawal notice from the member. If the membership is terminated due to a merger or consolidation, the membership capital stock is deemed to be excess stock and is repurchased. The activity capital stock (i.e., supporting advances, letters of credit and MPF) relating to termination, withdrawal, mergers or consolidation is recalculated based on the underlying activity. Any excess activity capital stock is repurchased on an ongoing basis as part of the Bank s excess stock repurchase program that is in effect at the time. Therefore, the redemption period could be less than five years if the stock becomes excess stock. However, the redemption period could extend beyond five years if the underlying activity is still outstanding. 
    
  Dividends and Retained Earnings.   Each FHLBank is required to contribute   20%   of its net income each quarter to a restricted retained earnings (RRE) account until the balance of that account equals at least   1%   of that FHLBank's average balance of outstanding consolidated obligations for the previous quarter.  These RRE will not be available to pay dividends.  At   September 30, 2016  , retained earnings were   $942.2 million  , including   $744.0 million   of unrestricted retained earnings and   $198.2 million   of RRE. 
    
  The Finance Agency has issued regulatory guidance to the FHLBanks relating to capital management and retained earnings. The guidance directs each FHLBank to assess, at least annually, the adequacy of its retained earnings with consideration given to future possible financial and economic scenarios. The guidance also outlines the considerations that each FHLBank should undertake in assessing the adequacy of the Bank s retained earnings. The Bank s retained earnings policy and capital adequacy metric utilize this guidance. 
    
  Dividends paid by the Bank are subject to Board approval and may be paid in either capital stock or cash; historically, the Bank has paid cash dividends only.  In February 2016, the Bank paid a quarterly dividend equal to an annual yield of   5.0%   and   3.0%   on activity stock and membership stock, respectively.  In April, July and October 2016, the Bank paid quarterly dividends equal to an annual yield of   5.0%   and   2.0%   on activity and membership stock, respectively.

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

From time to time, a member of one FHLBank may be acquired by a member of another FHLBank. When such an acquisition occurs, the two FHLBanks may agree to transfer at fair value the loans of the acquired member to the FHLBank of the surviving member. The FHLBanks may also agree to the purchase and sale of any related hedging instrument. The Bank had no such activity during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Additional discussions regarding related party transactions can be found in Note 18 to the audited financial statements in the Bank's 2015 Form 10-K. 

Note 13   Estimated Fair Values  
    
  Fair value amounts have been determined by the Bank using available market information and appropriate valuation methods. These estimates are based on recent market data and other pertinent information available to the Bank at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Although the management of the Bank believes that the valuation methods are appropriate and provide a reasonable determination of the fair value of these financial instruments, there are inherent limitations in any valuation technique. Therefore, these fair values are not necessarily equal to the amounts that would be realized in current market transactions, although they do reflect the Bank s judgment of how a market participant would estimate the fair values. 
    
  The carrying value and estimated fair value of the Bank s financial instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented in the table below.

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

Notes: 
   (1)    The estimated fair value amount for the mandatorily redeemable capital stock line item includes accrued dividend interest; this amount is excluded from the estimated fair value for the accrued interest payable line item. 
   (2)    Amounts represent the application of the netting requirements that allow the Bank to settle positive and negative positions and also cash collateral held or placed by the Bank with the same clearing agent and/or counterparties. 
    
  Fair Value Hierarchy.    The fair value hierarchy is used to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value for those assets and liabilities carried at fair value. The inputs are evaluated and an overall level for the fair value measurement is determined. This overall level is an indication of the market observability of the fair value measurement for the asset or liability.  
    
  The fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three broad levels: 
    
    Level 1 Inputs   - Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the reporting entity can access on the measurement date.  
    
    Level 2 Inputs   - Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable inputs for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include the following: (1) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; (2) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active or in which little information is released publicly; (3) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals, and implied volatilities); and (4) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means. 
    
    Level 3 Inputs   - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. 
    
  The Bank reviews its fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the observability of the valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of certain assets or liabilities. These reclassifications are reported as transfers in/out as of the beginning of the quarter in which the changes occur. There were no such transfers during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Summary of Valuation Methodologies and Primary Inputs 
    
  Cash and Due from Banks.   The fair values equal the carrying values. 
    
  Interest-Bearing Deposits.   The fair value is determined by calculating the present value of the future cash flows. The discount rates used in these calculations are the rates for interest-bearing deposits with similar terms.  These instruments  maturity term is overnight. 
    
  Federal Funds Sold.   The fair value of Federal funds sold is determined by calculating the present value of the future cash flows. The discount rates used in these calculations are the rates for Federal funds with similar terms.  These instruments  maturity term is overnight. 
    
  Securities Purchased Under Agreements to Resell.    The fair values are determined by calculating the present value of the future cash flows.  The discount rates used in these calculations are the rates for securities with similar terms.  Based on the fair value of the related collateral held, the securities purchased under agreements to resell were fully collateralized for the periods presented. There were no offsetting liabilities related to these securities at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. These instruments  maturity term is overnight. 
    
    Investment Securities   non-MBS.   The Bank uses the income approach to determine the estimated fair value of non-MBS investment securities. The significant inputs include a market-observable interest rate curve and a discount spread, if applicable. The market-observable interest rate curves used by the Bank and the related instrument types they measure are as follows: 

Treasury curve: U.S. Treasury obligations 
                
    LIBOR Swap curve: certificates of deposit 
                
    CO curve: GSE, state and local agency, and other U.S. obligations 
       
  Investment Securities   MBS.    To value MBS holdings, the Bank obtains prices from   four   designated third-party pricing vendors, when available. The pricing vendors use various proprietary models to price MBS. The inputs to those models are derived from various sources including, but not limited to: benchmark yields, reported trades, dealer estimates, issuer spreads, benchmark securities, bids, offers and other market-related data. Since many MBS do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing vendors use available information such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing to determine the prices for individual securities, as applicable. Each pricing vendor has an established challenge process in place for all MBS valuations, which facilitates resolution of potentially erroneous prices identified by the Bank.  
    
  During the year, the Bank conducts reviews of the four pricing vendors to enhance its understanding of the vendors' pricing processes, methodologies and control procedures for agency and private label MBS. To the extent available, the Bank also reviews the vendors' independent auditors' reports regarding the internal controls over their valuation processes. 
    
  The Bank's valuation technique first requires the establishment of a median price for each security. All prices that are within a specified tolerance threshold of the median price are included in the cluster of prices that are averaged to compute a default price. Prices that are outside the threshold (outliers) are subject to further analysis (including, but not limited to, comparison to prices provided by an additional third-party valuation service, prices for similar securities, and/or non-binding dealer estimates) to determine if an outlier is a better estimate of fair value. If an outlier (or some other price identified in the analysis) is determined to be a better estimate of fair value, then the outlier (or the other price as appropriate) is used as the final price rather than the default price. If, on the other hand, the analysis confirms that an outlier (or outliers) is (are) in fact not representative of fair value and the default price is the best estimate, then the default price is used as the final price. In all cases, the final price is used to determine the fair value of the security. If all prices received for a security are outside the tolerance threshold level of the median price, then there is no default price, and the final price is determined by an evaluation of all outlier prices as described above. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , four vendor prices were received for a majority of the Bank's MBS holdings, and the final prices for nearly all of those securities were computed by averaging the four prices. Based on the Bank's reviews of the pricing methods including inputs and controls employed by the third-party pricing vendors and the relative lack of dispersion among the vendor prices (or, in those instances in which there were outliers or significant yield variances, the Bank's additional analyses), the Bank believes the final prices are representative of the prices that would have been received if the assets had been sold at the measurement date (i.e., exit prices) and further that the fair value measurements are classified appropriately in the fair value hierarchy.  There continues to be unobservable inputs and a lack of significant market activity for private label MBS; therefore, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank classified private label MBS as Level 3. 
  
   83 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

Mutual Funds Offsetting Deferred Compensation and Employee Benefit Plan Obligations.   Fair values for publicly traded mutual funds are based on quoted market prices. 
    
  Advances.   The Bank determines the fair value by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows from the advances. The discount rates used in these calculations are equivalent to the replacement advance rates for advances with similar terms. The inputs used to determine fair value of advances are the LIBOR curve, a volatility assumption for advances with optionality, and a spread adjustment. 
    
  Mortgage Loans Held For Portfolio.   The fair value is determined based on quoted market prices for new MBS issued by U.S. GSEs. Prices are then adjusted for differences in coupon, seasoning and credit quality between the Bank s mortgage loans and the referenced MBS and a price adjustment reflective of a secondary mortgage market participant. The prices of the referenced MBS are highly dependent upon the underlying prepayment assumptions used in the secondary market.  
    
  Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable.   The fair values approximate the carrying values. 
    
  Derivative Assets/Liabilities.   The Bank bases the fair values of derivatives with similar terms on market prices, when available. However, market prices do not exist for many types of derivative instruments. Consequently, fair values for these instruments are estimated using standard valuation techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis and comparisons to similar instruments. Estimates developed using these methods are highly subjective and require judgment regarding significant matters such as the amount and timing of future cash flows, volatility of interest rates and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks.  
    
  The Bank is subject to credit risk on uncleared derivatives transactions due to the potential nonperformance by the derivatives counterparties. To mitigate this risk, the Bank has entered into netting arrangements for its uncleared derivative transactions. In addition, the Bank has entered into uncleared security agreements with all active derivatives counterparties that provide for delivery of collateral at specified levels tied to those counterparties  credit ratings to limit the Bank s net unsecured credit exposure to these counterparties.  For cleared derivatives, the Bank's credit risk exposure is mitigated because a central counterparty is substituted for individual counterparties and collateral is posted daily for changes in the value of cleared derivatives.  The Bank has evaluated the potential for the fair value of the instruments to be affected by counterparty credit risk and has determined that no adjustments were significant or necessary to the overall fair value measurements. 
    
  The fair values of the Bank s derivative assets and liabilities include accrued interest receivable/payable and cash collateral remitted to/received from counterparties. The estimated fair values of the accrued interest receivable/payable and cash collateral approximate their carrying values due to their short-term nature. The fair values of derivatives are netted by clearing agent and/or by counterparty pursuant to the provisions of each of the Bank s netting agreements. If these netted amounts are positive, they are classified as an asset and, if negative, as a liability. 
    
  The discounted cash flow analysis used to determine the fair value of derivative instruments utilizes market-observable inputs (inputs that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources). Inputs by class of derivative are as follows: 
    
  Interest-rate related: 
             
    Discount rate assumption.  Overnight Index Swap (OIS) curve. 
                
    Forward interest rate assumption.  LIBOR Swap Curve.  
                
    Volatility assumption. Market-based expectations of future interest rate volatility implied from current market prices for similar options. 
       
  Mortgage delivery commitments: 
             
    To Be Announced (TBA) securities prices. Market-based prices of TBAs are determined by coupon class and expected term until settlement and a pricing adjustment reflective of the secondary mortgage market. 
       
  BOB Loans.   The fair value approximates the carrying value. 
    
  Deposits.   The Bank determines the fair value by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows from the deposits. The discount rates used in these calculations are the cost of deposits with similar terms. Substantially all of these instruments  maturity terms are overnight. 
    
  Consolidated Obligations.   The Bank s internal valuation model determines fair values of consolidated obligations bonds and discount notes by calculating the present value of expected cash flows using market-based yield curves. The inputs used to  
  
   84 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

determine fair value of consolidated obligations are a CO curve and a LIBOR swap curve, a volatility assumption for consolidated obligations with optionality, and a spread adjustment. The OF constructs an internal curve, referred to as the CO curve, using the U.S. Treasury curve as a base curve that is then adjusted by adding indicative spreads obtained from market observable sources. These market indications are generally derived from pricing indications from dealers, historical pricing relationships, recent GSE trades and secondary market activity. 
    
  Mandatorily Redeemable Capital Stock.   The fair value of capital stock subject to mandatory redemption is generally its par value plus estimated dividends at the time of reclassification and any subsequently estimated dividend. FHLBank stock is not traded and no market mechanism exists for the exchange of stock outside the FHLBank System's cooperative structure. 
    
  Commitments.   For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The Bank issues standby letters of credit for a fee.  The unamortized fee is the letter of credit's carrying value and represents its fair value. The fair value of the Bank's commitments to extend credit for advances and letters of credit was immaterial at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Subjectivity of Estimates.   Estimates of the fair value of financial assets and liabilities using the methods described above are highly subjective and require judgments regarding significant matters such as the amount and timing of future cash flows, prepayment speed assumptions, expected interest rate volatility, possible distributions of future interest rates used to value options, and the selection of discount rates that appropriately reflect market and credit risks. The use of different assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value estimates. These estimates are susceptible to material near term changes because they are made as of a specific point in time.

Fair Value Measurements.   The following tables present, for each hierarchy level, the Bank s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or non-recurring basis on its Statement of Condition at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Bank measures certain mortgage loans held for portfolio at fair value when a charge-off is recognized and subsequently when the fair value less costs to sell is lower than the carrying amount.  Real estate owned is measured using fair value when the assets' fair value less costs to sell is lower than the carrying amount. 

86 

    Notes to Financial Statements (continued) 

Notes: 
   (1)    Amounts represent the application of the netting requirements that allow the Bank to settle positive and negative positions and also cash collateral held or placed by the Bank with the same clearing agent and/or counterparties. 
   (2)    Derivative liabilities represent the total liabilities at fair value. 
   (3)    The estimated fair values of impaired mortgage loans held for portfolio and real estate owned are determined based on values provided by a third party's retail-based AVM.  The Bank adjusts the AVM value based on the amount it has historically received on liquidation. 
    
  There were no transfers between Levels 1 or 2 during the first nine months of 2016 or 2015.

Level 3 Disclosures for all Assets and Liabilities That Are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis.   The following table presents a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on the Statement of Condition using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. For instruments carried at fair value, the Bank reviews the fair value hierarchy classifications each quarter. Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets or liabilities. Such reclassifications are reported as transfers in/out at fair value in the quarter in which the changes occur.  Transfers are reported as of the beginning of the period. There were   no   Level 3 transfers during the first nine months of 2016.  During the first nine months of 2015, the Bank transferred one private label MBS from its HTM portfolio to its AFS portfolio, in the period in which the OTTI was recorded.  

Note: 
   (1)     All AFS Private Label MBS - HELOCs were sold during the first quarter of 2016.

Note 14   Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  The following table presents the Bank's various off-balance sheet commitments which are described in detail below. 

Notes  : 
   (1)    Excludes approved requests to issue future standby letters of credit of   $158.5 million   and   $136.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   (2)    Letters of credit in the amount of   $6.9 billion   and   $5.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, have annual renewal language that, as long as both parties agree, permit the letter of credit to be renewed for an additional year with a maximum renewal period of approximately   5 years  . 
   (3)    Includes   $23.6 million   and   $115.0 million   of consolidated obligation bonds which were hedged with associated interest rate swaps at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Commitments to Extend Credit on Standby Letters of Credit, Additional Advances and BOB Loans.   Standby letters of credit are issued on behalf of members for a fee. A standby letter of credit is a financing arrangement between the Bank and its member. If the Bank is required to make payment for a beneficiary s draw, these amounts are withdrawn from the member s Demand Deposit Account (DDA). Any remaining amounts not covered by the withdrawal from the member s DDA are converted into a collateralized overnight advance. 
    
  Unearned fees related to standby letters of credit are recorded in other liabilities and had a balance of   $4.2 million   and   $5.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Bank monitors the creditworthiness of its standby letters of credit based on an evaluation of the member. The Bank has established parameters for the review, assessment, monitoring and measurement of credit risk related to these standby letters of credit. 
    
  Based on management s credit analyses, collateral requirements, and adherence to the requirements set forth in Bank policy and Finance Agency regulations, the Bank has not recorded any additional liability on these commitments and standby letters of credit. Excluding BOB, commitments and standby letters of credit are collateralized at the time of issuance. The Bank records a liability with respect to BOB commitments, which is reflected in other liabilities on the Statement of Condition. 
    
  The Bank does not have any legally binding or unconditional unused lines of credit for advances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . However, within the Bank's Open RepoPlus advance product, there were conditional lines of credit outstanding of   $7.4 billion   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Commitments to Fund or Purchase Mortgage Loans.    The Bank may enter into commitments that unconditionally obligate the Bank to purchase mortgage loans under the MPF Program. These delivery commitments are generally for periods not to exceed   60   days.  Such commitments are recorded as derivatives. 
    
  Pledged Collateral.    The Bank may pledge cash and securities, as collateral, related to derivatives.  Refer to Note 9 - Derivatives and Hedging Activities for additional information about the Bank's pledged collateral and other credit-risk-related contingent features. 
    
  Legal Proceedings.   The Bank is subject to legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.  The Bank would record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. After consultation with legal counsel, management does not anticipate that the ultimate liability, if any, arising out of these matters will have a material effect on the Bank's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  Notes 6, 9, 10, 11, and 12 also discuss other commitments and contingencies.

Based on this evaluation, the Bank s chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and chief accounting officer concluded that the Bank s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   third quarter   of   2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Bank s internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1: Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Bank may be subject to various legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business.
