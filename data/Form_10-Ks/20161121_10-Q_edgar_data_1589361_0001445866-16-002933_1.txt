Mount TAM Biotechnologies, Inc.

Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016

Note 1   Nature of the Business

Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated in November, 2011. The terms "we," "us," "our," "registrant," and the "Company" refer to Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc., a Nevada corporation, and, where applicable, Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary ("Mount Tam"). The Company is an early-stage life sciences and technology company pursuing the development of bio-pharmaceuticals to treat serious diseases, including autoimmune diseases. The Company intends to optimize and bring to market a portfolio of products focused on improving the health and wellbeing of individuals afflicted with serious diseases, with a lead product targeting systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and a strategy to bring to market novel therapeutics across a range of serious disease areas. The Company is headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. 

On August 13, 2015, Mount Tam entered into a Share Exchange and Conversion Agreement (the "Exchange Agreement") with the Company and certain other persons party thereto. Immediately following the effective time of the Exchange Agreement, Mount Tam's stockholders (as of immediately prior to the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement (such transactions, the "Share Exchange")) owned approximately 57.14% of the Company's outstanding common stock and the Company's stockholders (as of immediately prior to the Share Exchange) owned approximately 42.86% of the Company's outstanding common stock. Additionally, following the Share Exchange, the business conducted by Mount Tam became the primary the business conducted by the Company.

As a result of the Share Exchange, Mount Tam became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. However, the former stockholders of Mount Tam acquired a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock.  In connection with the Share Exchange, a former shareholder of the Company agreed to surrender all of his shares of the Company's common stock in exchange for $30,000, and all of the issued and outstanding shares of Epicurean Cigars, Inc., which at the time was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which had a nominal remaining net liability. The shares were returned to the Company, and the $30,000 due to the shareholder had been accrued as of March 31, 2016  .   As of September 30, 2016, the Company eliminated the $30,000 financial obligation pursuant to an executed Resignation, Release and Waiver agreement between the Company and the former shareholder. 

Effective on August 31, 2015, the Company changed its name from TabacaleraYsidron, Inc. to Mount TAM Biotechnologies, Inc.  The name change was effected through a parent/subsidiary short-form merger of Mount TAM Biotechnologies, Inc., our wholly-owned Nevada subsidiary which we formed solely for the purpose of the name change, with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving corporation.  With the exception of the name change, there were no changes to the Company's Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. There was no mandatory exchange of stock certificates. The Company's trading symbol on the PINK market operated by OTC Markets Group, was changed to "MNTM" from "TQBY".

Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc., the Company's wholly-owned legal subsidiary, was the "accounting acquirer," and for accounting purposes, the Company was deemed as having been "acquired" in the Share Exchange.  The board of directors and officers that managed and operated Mount Tam immediately prior to the effective time of the Share Exchange became the Company's board of directors and officers.

To meet its business objectives, the Company formed a strategic partnership with the Buck Institute for Research on Aging ("Buck Institute"), an independent research facility focused on understanding the connection between aging and chronic disease. As part of the partnership, the Company signed an exclusive worldwide licensing and collaboration agreement with the Buck Institute that includes many of the Buck Institute's intangible research and development assets in the area of autoimmune disorders. This collaboration has since been expanded to include all therapeutic and diagnostic uses of certain compounds in the human or veterinary fields.  The Company's research and development efforts are currently focused on a pre-clinical stage compound for the treatment of SLE with potential to treat other serious diseases as well. The Company has not produced any revenues from the intangible research and development assets it acquired from Buck Institute and it has not commenced its planned principal operations.  

The production and marketing of the Company's products and its ongoing research and development activities will be subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States. Prior to marketing in the United States, any drug developed by the Company must undergo additional rigorous preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) testing and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the Food and Drug Administration under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. In addition, the Company's success will depend in part on its ability to obtain and maintain patents, exploit its product license rights, maintain trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and other countries.

The following reflects the Company's current, post-merger corporate structure (State of Incorporation):

Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc., formerly TabacaleraYsidron, Inc. (Nevada) 

Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc. (Delaware)

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

The Company is a publicly-traded biotechnology company dedicated to speeding the delivery of new treatment options to patients affected by serious diseases through the development and application of highly specialized drug discovery and development  platforms and formulation expertise. The Company focuses on areas of serious medical need where it can have the greatest potential impact.

The Company is subject to a number of risks, including: the need to raise capital through equity and/or debt financings; the uncertainty whether the Company's research and development efforts will result in successful commercial products; competition from larger organizations; reliance on licensing proprietary technology of others; dependence on key personnel; uncertain patent protection; and dependence on corporate partners and collaborators.  See the section titled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016.

History 

The Company was established in November 2011 under the name TabacaleraYsidron. Mount Tam was incorporated on August 13, 2014 (date of inception). On August 13, 2014, Mount Tam issued 9,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value, for $900.

On August 13, 2015, Mount Tam and the Company entered into the Exchange Agreement as described above.

The Share Exchange was treated as a reverse acquisition of the Company, a public shell company at the time, by Mount Tam for financial accounting and reporting purposes. As such, Mount Tam was treated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes while the Company is treated as the acquired entity for accounting and financial reporting purposes. As a result of the Share Exchange, $50,048 of accounts payable and $17,500 of a note payable of the Company was brought forward at their book values and no goodwill has been recognized. Prior to the Share Exchange, the Company was a non-operating public shell company with nominal operations and nominal assets.

Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

The significant accounting policies applied in the annual consolidated financial statements of the Company as of December 31, 2015 are applied consistently in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 have been prepared in accordance with the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("U.S. GAAP") for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the Company's results of operation for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company's Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016. The December 31, 2015 condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from the audited financial statements included in the Form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016. The financial statements and notes are representations of the Company's management ("Management") and its board of directors (the "Board of Directors"), who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity.

Results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016 or any other future period.

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Management makes estimates that affect certain accounts including deferred income tax assets, accrued expenses, fair value of equity instruments and reserves for any other commitments or contingencies. Any adjustments applied to estimates are recognized in the period in which such adjustments are determined.

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of those investments approximates their fair market value due to their short maturity and liquidity. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts on deposit with financial institutions, which amounts may at times exceed federally insured limits. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts and it does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $714,263 and $5,447, respectively.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

The carrying amounts of certain of the Company's financial instruments including cash and cash equivalents, prepaid expenses, accounts payable, accrued liabilities and note payable approximate fair value due either to length of maturity or interest rates that approximate prevailing market rates unless otherwise disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.

Research and Development costs 

The Company follows Accounting Standards Codification Subtopic ("ASC") 730-10, "Research and Development," in which research and development costs are charged to the statement of operations as incurred. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company incurred $89,137 and $6,655, respectively of expenses related to research and development costs. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred $230,179 and $418,900, respectively, of expenses related to research and development costs.

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share 

The Company computes earnings per share under ASC 260-10, "Earnings Per Share." Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to the common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding (the denominator) during the reporting periods. Diluted loss per share is computed by increasing the denominator by the weighted average number of additional shares that could have been outstanding from securities convertible into common stock (using the "treasury stock" method), unless their effect on net loss per share is anti-dilutive. There were no potentially dilutive shares for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016.

Accounts Payable 

Accounts payable and accrued expenses include the following as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

Fair Value Measurements 

The Company measures and discloses the fair value of assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" ("ASC 820"). ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and enhances fair value measurement disclosure.

ASC 825 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets to which we have access at the measurement date.

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

The determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company has determined that there we no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.

The Company believes the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, other current assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses salaries, wages and payroll taxes, and other accrued expenses are a reasonable approximation of the fair value of those financial instruments because of the nature of the underlying transactions and the short-term maturities involved.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Going Concern 

The Company's financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has no significant operating history and had a cumulative net loss from August 13, 2014 to September 30, 2016 of $3,869,904. The Company has a working capital of $3,008 as of September 30, 2016. Since inception, the Company has been funded through debt and equity financings. The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and to allow it to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2016 have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company believes its cash resources are insufficient to meet its anticipated needs during the next twelve months. The Company will require additional financing to fund its future planned operations, including research and development and clinical trials and commercialization of its product candidates. In addition, the Company will require additional financing in order to seek to license or acquire new assets, research and develop any potential patents and the related compounds, and obtain any further intellectual property that the Company may seek to acquire.

The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining adequate capital to fund operating losses until it establishes a revenue stream and becomes profitable. Management's plans to continue as a going concern include raising additional capital through borrowing and sales of common stock. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. If the Company is not able to obtain the necessary additional financing on a timely basis, the Company will be forced to delay or scale down some or all of its development activities or perhaps even cease the operation of its business.  Since its inception, the Company has funded its operations primarily through debt financings and it expects that it will continue to fund its operations through a mix of equity and debt financings.  If the Company secures additional financing by issuing equity securities, its existing stockholders' ownership will be diluted.  The Company also expects to pursue non-dilutive financing sources. However, obtaining such financing would require significant efforts by Management, and such financing may not be available, and if available, could take a long period of time to obtain. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern.

Comprehensive Loss 

Comprehensive loss is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding transactions resulting from investment owners and distributions to owners. For the periods presented, comprehensive loss did not differ from net loss.

Collaborative Arrangements 

The Company and its collaborative partners are active participants in the collaborative arrangements and both parties are exposed to significant risks and rewards depending on the commercial success of the activity. The Company records all expenses related to collaborative arrangements as research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Going Concern ("ASU 2014-15"). ASU 2014-15 provides GAAP guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and about related footnote disclosures. For each reporting period, management will be required to evaluate whether there are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the date the financial statements are issued. The standard will be effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted for annual or interim reporting periods for which the financial statements have not previously been issued. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on the Company's financial statements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03, Interest   Imputation of Interest:  Simplifying the presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ("ASU 2015-03").  The standard requires entities to present debt issuance costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset, and the amortization is reported as interest expense.  The result of application of this guidance would be to reduce the deferred financing costs balance, with a corresponding reduction to the long term liabilities to which the debt issuance costs relate in the balance sheets.  The standard does not affect recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 and, as of September 30, 2016, there are no debt issuance cost.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements Issued But Not Adopted as of September 30, 2016 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): This ASU amends the Board's guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption will be permitted.  The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements.

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of licensing implementation guidance. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, the amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The guidance in Topic 842 supersedes Topic 840, Leases. The core principle of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For public companies, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements.

In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.

In November 2015, the FASB issued (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Currently deferred taxes for each tax jurisdiction are presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability on the balance sheet. To simplify the presentation, the new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets for all jurisdictions along with any related valuation allowances be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows, and did not have any effect on prior periods due to the full valuation allowance against the Company's net deferred tax assets.

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement  Period Adjustments. Changes to the accounting for measurement-period adjustments relate to business combinations. Currently, an acquiring entity is required to retrospectively adjust the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill as a result of changes made to the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree. The measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the balance sheet amounts recognized for a business combination (generally up to one year from the date of acquisition). The changes eliminate the requirement to make such retrospective adjustments, and, instead require the acquiring entity to record these adjustments in the reporting period they are determined. The new standard is effective for both public and private companies for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this new standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement," which provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This ASU is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance.

In April 2015, the FASB issued guidance related to a customer's accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. This standard provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis," which makes changes to both the variable interest model and voting interest model and eliminates the indefinite deferral of FASB Statement No. 167, included in ASU 2010-10, for certain investment funds. All reporting entities that hold a variable interest in other legal entities will need to re-evaluate their consolidation conclusions as well as disclosure requirements. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted, including any interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, "Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20)," effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. This update eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. The adoption of ASU 2014-16 will not have a significant impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)." Entities commonly raise capital by issuing different classes of shares, including preferred stock, that entitle the holders to certain preferences and rights over the other shareholders. The specific terms of those shares may include conversion rights, redemption rights, voting rights, and liquidation and dividend payment preferences, among other features. One or more of those features may meet the definition of a derivative under U.S. GAAP. Shares that include such embedded derivative features are referred to as hybrid financial instruments. The objective of this update is to eliminate the use of different methods in practice and thereby reduce existing diversity under U.S. GAAP in the accounting for hybrid financial instruments issued in the form of a share. The amendments are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2014-16 will not have a significant impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40), effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. This standard provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company expects to adopt this guidance on January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, the adoption of ASU 2014-15 will have on footnote disclosures, however, the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have any impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)," on revenue recognition. This guidance provides that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This guidance also requires more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The original effective date of this guidance was for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, early adoption is not permitted, and the guidance must be applied retrospectively or modified retrospectively. In July 2015, the FASB approved an optional one-year deferral of the effective date. As a result, we expect to adopt this guidance on January 1, 2018. The Company has not yet determined its approach to adoption or the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows, if any.

There were various other updates recently issued, most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not expected to a have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Note 3   Loans

By way of background, and as previously disclosed in the Company's public filings, the Company previously entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the "Buck Institute License Agreement") with the Buck Institute, which establishes a joint research effort led by Buck Institute to identify and develop compounds from two specific chemical chemotypes identified therein. The Company agreed to provide certain funding for Buck Institute's research efforts performed under the Buck Institute License Agreement. Under the terms of the Buck Institute License Agreement, Buck Institute assigned exclusive, worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize pharmaceutical products that incorporate a compound from one of two chemical compounds, identified therein, and exclusive rights to practice the drug discovery platform technology as necessary to research, develop and commercialize such pharmaceutical products. (Additional information about the Buck Institute License Agreement, together with prior amendments thereto, may be found in the Company's public filings, including the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.)

Pursuant to this Amendment, the Research Collaboration Term of the License Agreement is tolled until the Company can achieve a Qualified Financing (defined as any financing occurring after the date of the Amendment which results in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $2,000,000). Once a Qualified Financing has been achieved, the research collaboration efforts will resume, and will continue for a period of twenty-one months (the "Extended Research Collaboration Term"). The Company and The Buck Institute agreed to work together to determine a new research plan, specifying the research and development activities of both parties during the Extended Research Collaboration Term.

Additionally, pursuant to the Amendment, the parties agreed to settle past research funding amounts owed by the Company to The Buck Institute. The Company agreed to pay $40,000 within ten days of the execution of the Amendment, and The Buck Institute agreed that once this amount is paid, the Company will be deemed to be in full compliance with the terms of the License Agreement, including its payment obligations. On July 19, 2016, the Company made the $40,000 payment to The Buck Institute.  In addition to the $40,000 payment, on June 13, 2016, the Company paid to The Buck Institute $11,706 in connection with costs incurred to further the Company's intellectual property position under the License Agreement. Pursuant to the above amendment The Buck Institute waived $274,247 of payable by the Company.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION

The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the Company, and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the Risk Factors and Business sections in the form 10-K filed on April 14, 2016. Words such as "anticipate," "estimate," "plan," "project," "continuing," "ongoing," "expect," "believe," "intend," "may," "will," "should," "could," and similar expressions are used to identify forward-looking statements.

We believe that our assumptions are based upon reasonable data derived from and known about our business and operations and the business and operations of the Company. No assurances are made that actual results of operations or the results of our future activities will not differ materially from its assumptions. Factors that could cause differences include, but are not limited to, expected market demand for the Company's products and services and competition. 

The Share Exchange was treated as a reverse acquisition for financial accounting and reporting purposes.  As such, Mount Tam is treated as the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes while the Company was treated as the acquired entity for accounting and financial reporting purposes.  Further, as a result, the historical financial statements that will be reflected in the Company's future financial statements filed with the SEC will be those of Mount Tam, and the Company's assets, liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with the assets, liabilities and results of operations of Mount Tam.  Accordingly, for clarity and continuity, we are presenting the historical financial statements for Mount Tam for the periods presented.

Overview

We are an early stage company primarily engaged in the development of bio-pharmaceuticals to treat a range of disease areas with high unmet need. Our lead program is focused on SLE, and we intend to optimize and bring to market a portfolio of leading products focused on improving the health and well being of millions of people who have been affected by a range of serious disease conditions. To that end, we have formed a strategic partnership with the Buck Institute, an independent research facility focused on understanding the connection between aging and chronic disease. As part of the partnership, we have signed the License Agreement that includes many of the Buck Institute's intangible research and development assets. The initial focus of our research and development efforts will be a pre-clinical stage compound for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus ("SLE"), a serious form of lupus.  

Plan of Operations

As shown in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company incurred net losses of $552,460 and $1,516,770 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively and has an accumulated deficit of $3,869,904 as of September 30, 2016.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Our principal sources of cash have been proceeds from private placements of common stock and incurrence of debt. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had working capital of $3,008 with cash balance of $714,263. Our cash increased by approximately $708,816 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

On October 12, 2015, the Buck Institute delivered to us a letter stating that we had not performed certain covenants set forth in the License Agreement, including certain payment obligations. On October 16, 2015, the Company responded to the October 12, 2015 letter from the Buck Institute, and in such response, the Company proposed to defer payments for up to 90 days. The Buck Institute did not respond to this letter and took no formal steps or actions to terminate the License Agreement.

During the second quarter of 2016 the Company entered into negotiations with the Buck Institute to resolve certain outstanding financial concerns, and to broaden the Research Collaboration and License Agreement beyond the area of autoimmune disease.  On July 18, 2016, Mount Tam Biotechnologies, Inc. (the "Company"), entered into an amendment (the "Amendment") to the Research Collaboration and License Agreement (the "License Agreement") between the Company and The Buck Institute for Research on Aging ("The Buck Institute").

Pursuant to this Amendment, the Research Collaboration Term of the License Agreement is tolled until the Company can achieve a Qualified Financing (defined as any financing occurring after the date of the Amendment which results in gross proceeds to the Company of at least $2,000,000). Once a Qualified Financing has been achieved, the research collaboration efforts will resume, and will continue for a period of twenty-one months (the "Extended Research Collaboration Term"). The Company and The Buck Institute agreed to work together to determine a new research plan, specifying the research and development activities of both parties during the Extended Research Collaboration Term. 

Additionally, pursuant to the Amendment, the parties agreed to settle past research funding amounts owed by the Company to The Buck Institute. The Company agreed to pay $40,000 within ten days of the execution of the Amendment, and The Buck Institute agreed that once this amount is paid, the Company will be deemed to be in full compliance with the terms of the License Agreement, including its payment obligations. On July 19, 2016, the Company made the $40,000 payment to The Buck Institute.  In addition to the $40,000 payment, on June 13, 2016, the Company paid to The Buck Institute $11,706 in connection with costs incurred to further the Company's intellectual property position under the License Agreement. Pursuant to the above amendment The Buck Institute waived $274,247 of payable by the Company.

Moreover, the parties agreed that the field of use covered by the License Agreement would be expanded, with the new definition being "the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of any and all conditions or diseases including, without limitation, systemic lupus erythematous and multiple sclerosis for human and/or veterinary use." (Under the original License Agreement, the Company's field of use had been restricted to autoimmune disorders.) The foregoing is qualified in its entirety to the terms of the License Agreement, a copy of which was filed as Exhibit 99.1 to our Form 8-K filed on July 21, 2016.

Negative Operating Cash Flow

We reported negative cash flow from operations for the nine month ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. It is anticipated that we will continue to report negative operating cash flow in future periods, likely until one or more of our products are placed into production and released to our customers.

Our cash balance of $714,263 may not be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Additionally, if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to pay our expenses, we will need to raise additional funds to continue our operations. We have historically financed our operations through private equity and debt financings. Recent economic turmoil and lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets together with high volatility in prices in the equity capital markets have severely and adversely affected capital raising opportunities. We do not have any commitments for financing at this time, and financing may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing in amounts sufficient to fund our operations, if necessary, we will be forced to suspend or curtail our operations. In that event, current stockholders would likely experience a loss of most or all of their investment. Additional funding that we do obtain may be dilutive to the interests of existing stockholders.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We had cash and equivalents of $714,263 at September 30, 2016.

Operating Activities

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used $743,184 of cash in operating activities, compared to $993,772 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Non-cash adjustments included $15,358 and $20,000 in amortization of prepaid expenses, fair value of options of $400,702 and $34,861, amortization of debt discount of $65,127 and $0 and net change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $311,267 and $709,032 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Financing Activities

Financing activities provided $1,452,000 to us during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $996,796 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We received $477,000 in net proceeds from loans under the Secured Note for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $896,791 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, we received $975,000 in proceeds from issuance of common stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $100,005 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Sources of Liquidity and Capital

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received net proceeds from issuance of loans under the Secured Note in the amount of $477,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received $975,000 proceeds from issuance of common stock in a private placement. The capital raised has been used primarily to support our operations. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had remaining cash of $714,263 with net working capital of $3,008. As a result of the Company's significant operating expenditures and the lack of any significant product sales revenue, we expect to incur losses from operations for the near future.

We reported negative cash flow from operations for the period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. It is anticipated that we will continue to report negative operating cash flow in future periods, likely until one or more of our products are placed into production and released to our customers.

Our cash balance of $714,263 may not be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Additionally, if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to pay our expenses, we will need to raise additional funds to continue our operations. We have historically financed our operations through private equity and debt financings. Recent economic turmoil and lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets together with volatility in the equity capital markets have severely and adversely affected capital raising opportunities. We do not have any commitments for financing at this time, and financing may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing in amounts sufficient to fund our operations, if necessary, we will be forced to suspend or curtail our operations. In that event, current stockholders would likely experience a loss of most or all of their investment. Additional funding that we do obtain may be dilutive to the interests of existing stockholders.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

To the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or obtaining borrowings convertible into equity, ownership dilution to existing stockholders will result and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness or debt financing would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations. Our ability to obtain additional capital may depend on prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Economic crisis and disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit, as well as our ability to raise money in the capital markets. Instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business. The Company cannot provide any assurances that it will be able to raise the additional capital needed to fund its operations, or if the Company is able to raise such additional capital, that any such financing will be on terms which are beneficial to the existing shareholders.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the Company's financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires it to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an on-going basis, the Company evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company's critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed in footnote Note 2 to our financial statements.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

As a smaller reporting company as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide the information required by this Item.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

We are required to maintain "disclosure controls and procedures" as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that the information relating to our company required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure as a result of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.

Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  .

Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; 

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and 

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

TABLE OF CONTENTS 

Because of the inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Management's assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of these controls. Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that as of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles as a result of material weaknesses.

We have identified the following factors that have led management to determine that material weaknesses exist in our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016:

1. 
 We do not have written documentation of our internal control policies and procedures. Written documentation of key internal controls over financial reporting is a requirement of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have written documentation of our internal controls and procedures on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

2. 
 We do not have sufficient segregation of duties within accounting functions, which is a basic internal control. Due to our size and nature, segregation of all conflicting duties may not always be possible and may not be economically feasible. However, to the extent possible, the initiation of transactions, the custody of assets and the recording of transactions should be performed by separate individuals. Management evaluated the impact of our failure to have segregation of duties on our assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and has concluded that the control deficiency that resulted represented a material weakness. 

These factors represent material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. Although we believe the possibility of errors in our financial statements is remote, until such time as we expand our staff with additional qualified personnel, we expect to continue to report material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.

There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS

As of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes to the Risk Factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on April 14, 2016. (the "2015 Form 10-K").  The Risk Factors set forth in the 2015 Form 10-K should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and in connection with the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  Any of the risks described in the 2015 Form 10-K could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or future results and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made.  These are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.

ITEM 2 - UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

On November 2, 2016, the Company entered into a Subscription Agreement with an investor for such investor to purchase from the Company 166,666 shares on the Company's common stock at a price of $0.30 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000.  The Company intends to use the proceeds from this investment for general corporate and working capital purposes.

The common stock was offered to the investor in reliance upon an exemption from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Regulation D promulgated thereunder.  Our reliance on Regulation D under the Securities Act was based in part upon written representations made by the investor that: (a) the investor is acquiring the securities for his, her or its own account for investment and not for the account of any other person and not with a view to or for distribution, assignment or resale in connection with any distribution within the meaning of the Securities Act, (b) the investor agrees not to sell or otherwise transfer the securities unless they are registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws, or an exemption from such registration is available, (c) the investor has knowledge and experience in financial and business matters such that he, she or it is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an investment in the Company, (d) the investor had access to all of our documents, records, and books pertaining to the investment and was provided the opportunity to ask questions and receive answers regarding the terms and conditions of the offering or issuance and to obtain any additional information which we possessed or were able to acquire without unreasonable effort and expense, and (e) the investor has no need for liquidity in its investment and could afford the complete loss of such investment.  In our reliance upon Rule 506(b) of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act, management made the determination, based upon written representations, that such investor was an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D. In addition, there was no general solicitation or advertising for securities issued in reliance upon Regulation D.

Our reliance upon Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 was based in part upon the following factors: (a) the issuance of the securities was in connection with isolated private transactions which did not involve any public offering; (b) there were a limited number of offerees; (c) there were no subsequent or contemporaneous public offerings of the securities by us; (d) the securities were not broken down into smaller denominations; and (e) the negotiations for the sale of the securities took place directly between the offeree and the Company.
