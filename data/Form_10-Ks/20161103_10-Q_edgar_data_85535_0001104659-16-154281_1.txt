   1.                                           OPERATIONS, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  
     
  Royal Gold, Inc. ( Royal Gold , the  Company ,  we ,  us , or  our ), together with its subsidiaries, is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metals streams, royalties and similar interests.  We seek to acquire existing stream and royalty interests or to finance projects that are in production or in the development stage in exchange for stream or royalty interests.  A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more metals produced from a mine at a price determined for the life of the transaction by the purchase agreement.  Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any.  
     
   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for annual financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments which are of a normal recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation of our interim financial statements have been included in this Form 10-Q.  Operating results for the three months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.  These interim unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 11, 2016 ( Fiscal 2016 10-K ).  
     
  Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform with the presentation in the current period financial statements.  Reclassified amounts were not material to the financial statements.  
     
   Recently Issued Account Standards   
     
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) guidance to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation with actual forfeitures as they occur, as well as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows.  The new guidance is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning July 1, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, as long as all of the amendments are adopted in the same period.  We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.  
     
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU guidance for the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers.  Subsequent to the issuance of this ASU guidance, the FASB issued additional related ASU s on revenue recognition.  The effective date and transition requirements for all of these ASU s are the same.  Specifically, the guidance under these ASU s is to be applied using a full retrospective method or a modified retrospective method, as described in the guidance, and is effective for the Company s fiscal year beginning July 1, 2018.  The Company is currently evaluating the level of effort needed to implement the guidance, evaluating the provisions of each new guidance, and assessing their impact on

   2.                                           ACQUISITIONS  
     
   Acquisition of Additional Royalty Interests at Cortez   
     
  On September 19, 2016, Royal Gold, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Denver Mining Finance Company, Inc., acquired a 3.75% Net Value Royalty ( NVR ) covering a significant area of Barrick Gold Corporation s ( Barrick ) Cortez mine, including the Crossroads deposit, from a private party seller for total consideration of $70 million.  With this acquisition, Royal Gold s interests at Cortez Crossroads comprise a 4.43% NVR and a 5% sliding-scale Gross Smelter Return ( GSR ) royalty at current gold prices.  Royal Gold s interests on production from the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits as well as portions of the Gap deposit are comprised of a 4.83% NVR and a 5.71% GSR royalty at current gold prices.  
     
  The acquisition of the additional royalty interests at Cortez has been accounted for as an asset acquisition.  The portion of the acquisition, plus direct transaction costs, attributable to the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits as well as portions of the Gap deposit ($10.2 million) has been recorded as a production stage royalty interest while the portion of the acquisition attributable to the Crossroads deposit ($59.8 million) has been recorded as a development stage royalty interest and both are included within  Stream and royalty interests, net,  on our consolidated balance sheets.  
     
   3.                                           STREAM AND ROYALTY INTERESTS

   Amendment to Mount Milligan   
     
  Refer to Note 12 for further discussion on the amendment to our Mount Milligan stream effective October 20, 2016.  
     
   4.                                           DEBT  
     
   The Company s non-current debt as of  September 30, 2016  and June 30, 2016 consists of the following: 

Convertible Senior Notes Due 2019   
     
  In June 2012, the Company completed an offering of $370 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% convertible senior notes due 2019 ( 2019 Notes ).  The 2019 Notes bear interest at the rate of 2.875% per annum, and the Company is required to make semi-annual interest payments on the outstanding principal balance of the 2019 Notes on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning December 15, 2012.  The 2019 Notes mature on June 15, 2019.  Interest expense recognized on the 2019 Notes for the three months ended September 30, 2016, was $5.8 million compared to $5.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and included the contractual coupon interest, the accretion of the debt discount and amortization of the debt issuance costs.  
     
   Revolving credit facility   
     
  The Company maintains a $650 million revolving credit facility.  The acquisition discussed in Note 2 was funded from our revolving credit facility during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $345 million outstanding and $305 million available under the revolving credit facility.  Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% to 3.00%, based on Royal Gold s defined leverage ratio.  As of September 30, 2016, the interest rate on borrowings under the revolving credit facility was LIBOR plus 1.75% for an all-in rate of 2.28%.  Royal Gold may repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility at any time without premium or penalty.  
     
  As discussed in Note 6 to the notes to consolidated financial statements in the Company s Fiscal 2016 10-K, the Company has financial covenants associated with its revolving credit facility.  At September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with each financial covenant.  
     
   5.                                           REVENUE

6.                                           STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  
     
  The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense as follows:  

Stock-based compensation expense is included within  General and administrative expense  in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).  
     
  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company granted the following stock-based compensation awards:  

As of  September 30, 2016 , unrecognized compensation expense (expressed in thousands below) and weighted-average vesting period for each of our stock-based compensation awards was as follows:

7.                                           EARNINGS PER SHARE ( EPS )  
     
  Basic earnings (loss) per common share were computed using the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, considering the effect of participating securities.  Unvested stock-based compensation awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method.  The Company s unvested restricted stock awards contain non-forfeitable dividend rights and participate equally with common stock with respect to dividends issued or declared.  The Company s unexercised stock options, unexercised SSARs and unvested performance stock do not contain rights to dividends.  Under the two-class method, the earnings (loss) used to determine basic earnings (loss) per common share are reduced by an amount allocated to participating securities.  Use of the two-class method has an immaterial impact on the calculation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per common share.

  (Unaudited)  
     
  The following tables summarize the effects of dilutive securities on diluted EPS for the period:  

The calculation of weighted average shares includes all of our outstanding common stock.  The Company intends to settle the principal amount of the 2019 Notes in cash.  As a result, there will be no impact to diluted earnings per share unless the share price of the Company s common stock exceeds the conversion price of $103.52.  
     
   8.                                           INCOME TAXES  

The higher effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily due to the prior year discrete tax impacts attributable to the Company s Andacollo transaction and liquidation of our Chilean subsidiary.  
     
   9.                                           SEGMENT INFORMATION  
     
  The Company manages its business under two reportable segments, consisting of the acquisition and management of stream interests and the acquisition and management of royalty interests.  Royal Gold s long-lived assets (stream and royalty interests, net) are geographically distributed as shown in the following table:

The Company s revenue, cost of sales and net revenue by reportable segment for the three months ended  September 30, 2016  and 2015, is geographically distributed as shown in the following table: 

10.                                    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
     
  FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ) establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.  The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC 820 are described below:  
     
  Level 1:                   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; 
     
  Level 2:                   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 
     
  Level 3:                   Prices or valuation techniques requiring inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity).

  The following table sets forth the Company s financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) by level within the fair value hierarchy.  

(1)    Included in  Other assets  on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 
  (2)    Included in the carrying amount is the equity component of our 2019 Notes in the amount of $77 million, which is included within  Additional paid-in capital  on the Company s consolidated balance sheets. 
     
  The Company s debt classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy is valued using quoted prices in an active market.  The carrying value of the Company s revolving credit facility (Note 4) approximates fair value as of September 30, 2016.    The warrants classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy are valued at each reporting period using the Black-Scholes model.  The warrants are part of the term loan funded to Golden Star Resources Ltd. in July 2015 and have been classified as a financial asset instrument.   Any change in the fair value of the warrants at subsequent reporting periods will be recorded within  Interest and other income  on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income. 
     
   As of September 30, 2016,  the Company also had assets that, under certain conditions, are subject to measurement at fair value on a non-recurring basis like those associated with stream and royalty interests, intangible assets and other long-lived assets.  For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if any of these assets are determined to be impaired.  If recognition of these assets at their fair value becomes necessary, such measurements will be determined utilizing Level 3 inputs.  
     
   11.                                    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

  On December 5, 2014, LNRLP filed amendments to its October 16, 2009 Statement of Claim in the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador Trial Division against Vale Inco Limited, now known as Vale Canada Limited ( Vale Canada ) and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Vale Inco Atlantic Sales Limited and VNL, related to calculation of the NSR on the sale of concentrates, including nickel concentrates, from the Voisey s Bay mine.  LNRLP asserts that the defendants have incorrectly calculated the NSR since production at Voisey s Bay began in late 2005, have indicated an intention to calculate the NSR in a manner LNRLP believes will violate the royalty agreement as Voisey s Bay concentrates are processed at Vale s new Long Harbour processing facility, and have breached their contractual duties of good faith and honest performance in several ways.  LNRLP requests an order in respect of the correct calculation of future payments, and unspecified damages for non-payment and underpayment of past royalties to the date of the claim, together with additional damages until the date of trial, interest, costs and other damages.  The litigation is in the discovery phase.

   Mount Milligan Stream Amendment   
     
  On October 20, 2016, Centerra Gold Inc. ( Centerra ) and Thompson Creek Metals Inc. ( Thompson Creek ) completed the Plan of Arrangement (the  Arrangement ) previously announced on July 5, 2016, pursuant to which Centerra acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Thompson Creek.  RGLD Gold AG s ( RGLD Gold ) streaming interest at Mount Milligan was amended (the  amendment ) concurrently with the closing of the Arrangement.  
     
  Under the terms of the amendment, RGLD Gold s 52.25% gold stream at Mount Milligan was amended to a 35% gold stream and an 18.75% copper stream.  RGLD Gold will continue to pay $435 per ounce of gold delivered and will pay 15% of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered.  Mount Milligan gold in concentrate in transit prior to October 20, 2016, will be delivered to RGLD Gold under the current 52.25% stream.  Under the terms of both the original and amended agreements, there is a maximum of five months between concentrate shipment and final settlement, and RGLD Gold expects to begin receiving gold and copper deliveries reflecting the amended stream agreement around March 2017.

   General   
     
  This Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD A ) is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.  Royal Gold, Inc. ( Royal Gold , the  Company ,  we ,  us , or  our ), recommends that you read this MD A in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on August 11, 2016 (the  Fiscal 2016 10-K ).  
     
  This MD A contains forward-looking information.  You should review our important note about forward-looking statements following this MD A.  
     
  We refer to  GSR,   NSR,   NVR,   metal stream (or  stream )  and other types of royalty or similar interests throughout this MD A.  These terms are defined in our Fiscal 2016 10-K.  
     
   Statement Regarding Third Party Information   
     
  Certain information provided in this report, including production estimates for calendar 2016, has been provided to us by the operators of properties where we own interests or is publicly available information filed by these operators with applicable securities regulatory bodies, including the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Royal Gold has not verified, and is not in a position to verify, and expressly disclaims any responsibility for, the accuracy, completeness or fairness of such third-party information and refers the reader to the public reports filed by the operators for information regarding those properties.  
     
   Overview   
     
   Royal Gold, together with its subsidiaries , is engaged in the business of acquiring and managing precious metal streams, royalties, and similar interests.  We seek to acquire existing stream and royalty interests or to finance projects that are in production or in the development stage in exchange for stream or royalty interests.  
     
  We manage our business under two segments:  
     
   Acquisition and Management of Stream Interests     A metal stream is a purchase agreement that provides, in exchange for an upfront deposit payment, the right to purchase all or a portion of one or more metals produced from a mine, at a price determined for the term of the agreement.  As of September 30, 2016, we owned stream interests on four producing properties and three development stage properties.  As discussed further in our Fiscal 2016 10-K, we closed and funded approximately $1.4 billion in stream interests in our fiscal year 2016, including stream interests relating to Pueblo Viejo, Andacollo, Wassa and Prestea, and Rainy River.  Stream interests accounted for approximately 72% and 51% of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  We expect stream interests to continue representing a significant proportion of our total revenue. 
     
   Acquisition and Management of Royalty Interests     Royalties are non-operating interests in mining projects that provide the right to revenue or metals produced from the project after deducting specified costs, if any.  As of September 30, 2016, we owned royalty interests on 34 producing properties, 21 development stage properties and 131 exploration stage properties, of which we consider 50 to be evaluation stage projects.  We use  evaluation stage  to describe exploration stage properties that contain mineralized material and on which operators are engaged in the search for reserves.  Royalties accounted 
     
 16   

Table of Contents   
     
  for approximately 28% and 49% of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  We do not conduct mining operations on the properties in which we hold stream and royalty interests, and except for our interest in the Peak Gold, LLC joint venture, we generally are not required to contribute to capital costs, exploration costs, environmental costs or other operating costs on those properties.  
     
  In the ordinary course of business, we engage in a continual review of opportunities to acquire existing stream and royalty interests, to establish new streams on operating mines, to create new stream and royalty interests through the financing of mine development or exploration, or to acquire companies that hold stream and royalty interests.  We currently, and generally at any time, have acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, analysis of technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest and term sheets, participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes.  
     
  Our financial results are primarily tied to the price of gold and, to a lesser extent, the price of silver and copper, together with the amounts of production from our producing stage stream and royalty interests.  The price of gold, silver, copper and other metals has fluctuated widely in recent years.  The marketability and the price of metals are influenced by numerous factors beyond the control of the Company and significant declines in the price of gold, silver or copper could have a material and adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.  
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, gold, silver and copper price averages and percentage of revenue by metal were as follows:  

Recent Business Developments   
     
   Mount Milligan Stream Amendment   
     
  On October 20, 2016, Centerra Gold Inc. ( Centerra ) and Thompson Creek Metals Inc. ( Thompson Creek ) completed the Plan of Arrangement (the  Arrangement ) previously announced on July 5, 2016, pursuant to which Centerra acquired all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Thompson Creek.  RGLD Gold AG s ( RGLD Gold ) streaming interest at Mount Milligan was amended (the  amendment ) concurrently with the closing of the Arrangement.  
     
  Under the terms of the amendment, RGLD Gold s 52.25% gold stream at Mount Milligan was amended to a 35% gold stream and an 18.75% copper stream.  RGLD Gold will continue to pay $435 per ounce of gold delivered and will pay 15% of the spot price per metric tonne of copper delivered.  
     
  Mount Milligan gold in concentrate in transit prior to October 20, 2016, will be delivered to RGLD Gold under the current 52.25% stream.  Under the terms of both the original and amended agreements, there is a maximum of five months between concentrate shipment and final settlement, and RGLD Gold expects

Table of Contents   
     
  to begin receiving gold and copper deliveries reflecting the amended stream agreement around March 2017.  
     
  In connection with the amendment, RGLD Gold s first ranking security over 52.25% of gold produced from the Mount Milligan assets was amended to provide for first ranking security over 35% of produced gold and 18.75% of produced copper.  RGLD Gold s other existing security over the Mount Milligan assets remains unaffected.  
     
   Acquisition of Additional Royalty Interests at Cortez   
     
  On September 19, 2016, Royal Gold, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Denver Mining Finance Company, Inc., acquired a 3.75% Net Value Royalty ( NVR ) covering a significant area of Barrick Gold Corporation s ( Barrick ) Cortez mine, including the Crossroads deposit, from a private party seller for total consideration of $70 million.  With this acquisition, Royal Gold s interests at Cortez Crossroads comprise a 4.43% NVR and a 5% sliding-scale Gross Smelter Return ( GSR ) royalty at current gold prices.  Royal Gold s interests on production from the Pipeline and South Pipeline deposits as well as portions of the Gap deposit are comprised of a 4.83% NVR and a 5.71% GSR royalty at current gold prices.  
     
  As of December 31, 2015, proven and probable reserves subject to Royal Gold s interests at Cortez were estimated at 3.7 million ounces of gold, including approximately 3 million gold ounces at Crossroads.  Waste stripping at Crossroads is underway and production is expected to begin in calendar 2018.  
     
   Principal Stream and Royalty Interests   
     
  The Company considers both historical and future potential revenues in determining which stream and royalty interests in our portfolio are principal to our business.  Estimated future potential revenues from both producing and development properties are based on a number of factors, including reserves subject to our stream and royalty interests, production estimates, feasibility studies, metal price assumptions, mine life, legal status and other factors and assumptions, any of which could change and could cause the Company to conclude that one or more of such stream and royalty interests are no longer principal to our business.  Currently, our principal producing and development stream and royalty interests are listed alphabetically in the following tables.  
     
  Please refer to our Fiscal 2016 10-K for further discussion of our principal producing and development stream and royalty interests.

  Operators  Estimated and Actual Production by Stream and Royalty Interest for Calendar 2016  
  Principal Producing Properties  
  For the period January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016  

(1)                Production estimates received from our operators are for calendar 2016.  There can be no assurance that production estimates received from our operators will be achieved.  Please refer to our cautionary language regarding forward-looking statements following this MD A, as well as the Risk Factors identified in Part I, Item 1A, of our Fiscal 2016 10-K for information regarding factors that could affect actual results. 
     
  (2)                Actual production figures shown are from our operators and cover the period January 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016, unless otherwise noted. 
     
  (3)                Actual production figures for Cortez are based on information provided to us by the operators, and actual production figures for Andacollo, Mount Milligan, Pueblo Viejo, Pe asquito (gold) and Wassa and Prestea are the operators  publicly reported figures. 
     
  (4)                The estimated and actual production figures shown for Andacollo are contained gold in concentrate. 
     
  (5)                The estimated and actual production figures shown for Mount Milligan are payable gold in concentrate. Actual production shown is for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Nine months ended September 30, 2016, information was not available from the operator as of the date of this report. 
     
  (6)                The estimated and actual production figures shown are payable gold in dor  and represent Barrick s 60% interest in Pueblo Viejo.  In October 2016, Barrick increased their calendar 2016 gold production guidance from 600,000-650,000 ounces to 670,000-700,000 ounces. 
     
  (7)                The estimated production figure shown is payable gold in dor . Actual production shown is for the six months ended June 30, 2016.  Nine months ended September 30, 2016, information was not available from the operator as of the date of this report. 
     
  (8)                The estimated gold and silver production figures reflect payable gold and silver in concentrate and dor , while the estimated lead and zinc production figures reflect payable metal in concentrate. The Company s royalty interest at Pe asquito includes gold, silver, lead and zinc. 
     
   Property Developments   
     
  The following information is provided by the operators of the property, either to Royal Gold or in various documents made publicly available.  
     
   Stream Interests   
     
   Andacollo   
     
  Gold stream deliveries from Andacollo were approximately 15,300 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately 9,800 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Teck indicated that they expect calendar 2016 gold grade and production to exceed calendar 2015.  Teck reported copper production increased by 12% when compared to the prior year quarter due to   
     
 20   

Table of Contents   
     
  improved throughput ,  which primarily resulted from a deferral of major plant maintenance to later in calendar 2016 and a focus on improving operational efficiency in the flotation circuit.  
     
   Mount Milligan   
     
  Gold stream deliveries from Mount Milligan were approximately 29,900 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately 23,800 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase during the current quarter is primarily attributable to improved throughput and grade.  
     
  For the remainder of calendar 2016, the primary operational focus at Mount Milligan is to continue to optimize the mine and mill throughput with the expectation to gradually increase recoveries.  In October 2016, Thompson Creek announced that commissioning of the secondary crusher commenced and that the first feed through the secondary crusher is expected near the end of October 2016.  Centerra expects Mount Milligan gold production will be at the lower end of their calendar 2016 production guidance of 240,000 to 270,000 ounces and copper production to be on the higher end of the calendar 2016 guidance of 55 million to 65 million pounds.  
     
  Please refer to  Recent Business Developments  earlier in this MD A for discussion on amendments to our Mount Milligan stream.  
     
   Pueblo Viejo   
     
  Stream deliveries from Pueblo Viejo were approximately 13,700 ounces of gold and approximately 543,300 ounces of silver for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  RGLD Gold AG began receiving gold and silver deliveries during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and March 31, 2016, respectively.  Barrick reported that gold recovery improved during the current quarter as a result of higher grade and lower carbonaceous ore content.  Barrick also reported that silver recovery achieved its best quarterly performance to date at 67% during the current quarter, through process refinements and higher pre-heater availability.  
     
   Wassa and Prestea   
     
  Gold stream deliveries from Wassa and Prestea were approximately 4,500 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to approximately 6,300 ounces for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The prior year quarter benefited from the inclusion of one-third of the ounces for production associated with April 2015 through July 2015, per the stream agreement.  The open pit operations at Wassa and Prestea continued to be the primary source of production during the current quarter.  In July 2016, Golden Star stated they are on track to achieve their full year calendar 2016 production guidance of between 180,000 to 205,000 ounces of gold.  
     
  In July 2016, Golden Star announced that pre-commercial production commenced at the Wassa underground gold mine, as scheduled.  Golden Star expects Wassa underground to achieve commercial production in early calendar 2017, at which time it is expected to deliver 2,000 to 2,500 tonnes of ore per day.  The Prestea underground project is currently in development, and Golden Star expects first production at the Prestea underground project in mid-calendar 2017.

   Royalty Interests   
     
   Cortez   
     
  Production attributable to our royalty interests at Cortez during the three months ended September 30, 2016, was in-line with production during the prior year quarter.   Waste stripping at Crossroads, which is subject to our royalty interest, restarted in October 2016 and is currently ongoing. 
     
  Please refer to  Recent Business Developments  earlier in this MD A for discussion on the acquisition of additional royalty interests at Cortez.  
     
   Pe asquito   
     
  Gold, silver, lead and zinc production attributable to our royalty interest at Pe asquito decreased approximately 56%, 29%, 33% and 39%, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2016, when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in production  is attributable to lower grades and lower recoveries associated with processing lower grade stockpile ore.  Goldcorp reported that mining shifted from the lower grade upper transitional ore into higher grade ore in the lower portion of the pit towards the end of the September 2016 quarter. Goldcorp expects gold grades to continue to improve during the December 2016 quarter as the mine continues mining deeper into the higher gold grade zone. 
     
  Goldcorp reported that the Northern Well Field project, which will satisfy Pe asquito s long-term water requirements, ramped up as expected and reached full design capacity in the fourth quarter of calendar 2016.  
     
   Results of Operations   
     
   Quarter Ended September 30, 2016, Compared to Quarter Ended September 30, 2015   
     
   For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recorded net income attributable to Royal Gold stockholders of  $29.8  million, or $0.46 per basic and diluted share, as compared to a net loss attributable to Royal Gold stockholders of $45.0 million, or ($0.69) per basic and diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in our earnings per share in the current period was primarily attributable to an increase in our revenue, as discussed below.  During the prior year quarter, the Company s income tax expense increased due to the termination of the Andacollo royalty interest and the liquidation of our Chilean subsidiary by approximately $56.0 million.  The effect of the tax expense attributable to the termination of the Andacollo royalty interest during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, was $0.86 per share. 
     
   For the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we recognized total revenue of  $117.9  million, which is comprised of stream revenue of $85.5 million and royalty revenue of $32.4 million, at an average gold price of $1,335 per ounce, an average silver price of $19.61 per ounce and an average copper price of $2.16 per pound.  This is compared to total revenue of $74.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which was comprised of stream revenue of $37.9 million and royalty revenue of $36.2 million, at an average gold price of $1,124 per ounce, an average silver price of $14.91 per ounce and an average copper price of $2.39 per pound for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  Revenue and the corresponding production attributable to our stream and royalty interests for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015 is as follows:

  (3)                The gold and silver streams at Pueblo Viejo were acquired during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The first gold and silver stream deliveries were in December 2015 and March 2016, respectively. 
     
  (4)                Individually, no stream or royalty included within the  Other  category contributed greater than 5% of our total revenue for either period, with the exception of Voisey s Bay royalty revenue ($5.4 million) during the prior year quarter. 
     
   The increase in our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015, resulted primarily from an increase in our stream revenue and an increase in the average gold and silver prices.  The increase in our stream revenue was primarily attributable to new production from our Pueblo Viejo gold and silver stream and increased metal sales from Mount Milligan and Andacollo.   Our first gold stream delivery from Pueblo Viejo was in December 2015, while the first silver stream delivery from Pueblo Viejo was in March 2016.   Gold and silver ounces purchased and sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and gold and silver ounces in inventory as of September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, for our streaming interests were as follows:

Our royalty revenue decreased during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared with the quarter ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to production decreases at Pe asquito.  These production decreases were partially offset by an increase in the average gold and silver prices during the current period.  Please refer to  Recent Business Developments  and  Property Developments  earlier within this MD A for further discussion on recent developments regarding properties covered by certain of our stream and royalty interests.  
     
  Cost of sales were approximately $22.7 million for the three months ended  September 30, 2016, compared to $11.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase is primarily attributable to new production from our gold and silver streams at Pueblo Viejo, which resulted in cost of sales of approximately $5.9 million during the current period.  The increase was also attributable to increased stream deliveries from Andacollo and Mount Milligan during the current period, which resulted in additional cost of sales of approximately $4.9 million.  Cost of sales is specific to our stream agreements and is the result of RGLD Gold s purchase of gold and silver for a cash payment.  The cash payment at Mount Milligan is the lesser of $435 per ounce or the prevailing market price of gold when purchased, while the cash payment for our other streams is a set contractual percentage of the gold or silver spot price near the date of metal delivery. 
     
   General and administrative expenses increased to  $10.5  million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase during the current quarter was due to an increase in legal and litigation costs of approximately $1.3 million. 
     
   Depreciation, depletion and amortization increased to  $40.1  million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $27.1 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily attributable to new production from our gold and silver streams at Pueblo Viejo ($9.6 million) and an increase in gold stream sales from Mount Milligan and Andacollo, which resulted in additional depletion of approximately $5.7 million.  These increases were partially offset by lower overall production within our royalty interest segment. 
     
   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we recognized income tax expense totaling  $7.2  million compared with income tax expense of $59.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.1% in the current period, compared with 415.7% in the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in the effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily related to the discrete tax impacts attributable to the Company s Andacollo transactions and the liquidation of our Chilean subsidiary during the three months ended September 30, 2015.

   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
   Overview   
     
   At September 30, 2016, we had current assets of  $192.0  million compared to current liabilities of $25.6 million resulting in working capital of $166.4 million and a current ratio of 8 to 1.  This compares to current assets of $164.8 million and current liabilities of $22.7 million at June 30, 2016, resulting in working capital of $142.1 million and a current ratio of approximately 7 to 1.  The increase in our current ratio was primarily attributable to an increase in our cash and equivalents during the current period.  Please refer to  Summary of Cash Flows  below for further discussion on changes to our cash and equivalents during the period. 
     
   During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, liquidity needs were met from  $95.3  million in net revenue and our available cash resources.  The $70 million acquisition of additional royalty interests at Cortez, as discussed above, was funded from our revolving credit facility during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $305 million available and $345 million outstanding under its revolving credit facility.  Working capital, combined with the Company s undrawn revolving credit facility, resulted in approximately $470 million of total liquidity at September 30, 2016.  The Company was in compliance with each financial covenant as of September 30, 2016.  Refer to Note 4 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our debt and Note 11 for our remaining conditional commitments that impact our liquidity. 
     
  We believe that our current financial resources and funds generated from operations will be adequate to cover anticipated expenditures for debt service, general and administrative expense costs and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.  Our current financial resources are also available to fund dividends and for acquisitions of stream and royalty interests, including the remaining conditional commitments incurred in connection with the Ilovica, Wassa and Prestea and Rainy River stream acquisitions and the Peak Gold joint venture.  Our long-term capital requirements are primarily affected by our ongoing acquisition activities.  The Company currently, and generally at any time, has acquisition opportunities in various stages of active review.  In the event of one or more substantial stream and royalty interest or other acquisitions, we may seek additional debt or equity financing as necessary.  
     
  Please refer to our risk factors included in Part 1, Item 1A of our Fiscal 2016 10-K and in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a discussion of certain risks that may impact the Company s liquidity and capital resources.  
     
   Summary of Cash Flows   
     
   Operating Activities   
     
  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $55.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to an increase in proceeds received from our stream and royalty interests, net of production taxes and cost of sales, of approximately $17.2 million.  The increase was also due to a decrease in income taxes paid of approximately $38.0 million, which resulted from $47.7 million of cash taxes paid for the termination of the Andacollo royalty during the prior year quarter, partially offset by $9.7 million of cash taxes paid to taxing authorities, as a condition for appealing an assessment, during the current quarter.  
     
   Investing Activities   
     
   Net cash used in investing activities totaled  $90.0  million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to cash used in investing activities of $976.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to a decrease in acquisitions of stream and royalty interests in mineral properties compared to the prior year period (primarily the Pueblo Viejo and Andacollo stream acquisitions).  Refer to  Recent Business Developments  above for further discussion on our recently acquired royalty interests.

   Financing Activities   
     
   Net cash provided by financing activities totaled  $51.6  million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $335.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to the Company s $350 million borrowing under its revolving credit facility to fund stream acquisitions during the prior year period. 
     
   Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Critical Accounting Policies   
     
  There were no new accounting standards adopted during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Refer to Note 1 of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on recently issued accounting standards.  Refer to our Fiscal 2016 10-K for discussion on our critical accounting policies.

   ITEM 3.                                                     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK    
     
   Our earnings and cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in the market price of gold and other metals.  Gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metal prices can fluctuate significantly and are affected by numerous factors, such as demand, production levels, economic policies of central banks, producer hedging, world political and economic events and the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies.  Please see    Volatility in gold, silver, copper, nickel and other metal prices may have an adverse impact on the value of our stream and royalty interests and may reduce our revenues. Certain contracts governing our royalty stream interests have features that may amplify the negative effects of a drop in metals prices,    under Part I, Item 1A of our Fiscal 2016 10-K, for more information that can affect gold, silver, copper and other metal prices as well as historical gold, silver, copper and nickel prices. 
     
   During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, we reported revenue of  $117.9  million, with an average gold price for the period of $1,335 per ounce, an average silver price of $19.61 per ounce and an average copper price of $2.16 per pound.  Approximately 88% of our total reported revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were attributable to gold sales from our gold producing stream and royalty interests, as shown within the MD A.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, if the price of gold had averaged 10% higher or lower per ounce, we would have recorded an increase or decrease in revenue of approximately $10.7 million. 
     
   Approximately 7% of our total reported revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were attributable to silver sales from our silver producing stream and royalty interests.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, if the price of silver had averaged 10% higher or lower per ounce, we would have recorded an increase or decrease in revenue of approximately  $0.9  million. 
     
   Approximately 2% of our total reported revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were attributable to copper sales from our copper producing royalty interests.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, if the price of copper had averaged 10% higher or lower per pound, we would have recorded an increase or decrease in revenue of approximately  $0.4  million.

   ITEM 4.                   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  As of  September 30, 2016, the Company s management, with the participation of the President and Chief Executive Officer (the principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer (the principal financial and accounting officer) of the Company, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )).  Based on such evaluation, the Company s President and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer have concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the required time periods and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and its Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
     
  Disclosure controls and procedures involve human diligence and compliance and are subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures.  As a result, a control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  
     
   Changes in Internal Controls   
     
  There has been no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or that is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

   9.2            Vendor Right of First Offer on Copper Interest  
     
  (a)                                    If at any time and from time to time, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates wishes to offer for sale to any third party or, following an offer by a third party to purchase any of its rights to acquire Refined Copper under this Agreement (a   Purchaser Copper Right  ), then the Purchaser shall, by notice in writing to the Vendor, first offer to sell back such Purchaser Copper Right to the Vendor for cancellation (or at the option of the Vendor, for sale to an affiliate of the Vendor) at the price and upon substantially the terms that the Purchaser proposes to offer or accept from a third party (which offer the Purchaser shall promptly provide to the Vendor) (the   Purchaser Offer  ). 
     
  (b)                                    Upon receipt of a Purchaser Offer, the Purchaser and the Vendor shall negotiate in good faith for a period of up to 45 days (or such longer period as may be required to give the Parties five (5) Business Days to negotiate a Definitive Agreement following resolution of an Apportionment dispute in accordance with Section 9.2(d)) commencing on the date of delivery by the Purchaser to the Vendor of the Purchaser Offer (the   Negotiation Period (Vendor)  ) the definitive terms of an agreement for cancellation or sale, as the case may be, of the Purchaser Copper Right which is the subject of the Purchaser Offer (the   Definitive Agreement (Vendor)  ). 
     
  If, during the Negotiation Period (Vendor), the Vendor and the Purchaser agree on the terms of the Definitive Agreement (Vendor), then the Vendor and the Purchaser shall enter into the Definitive Agreement (Vendor) and proceed to close the transaction as soon as commercially reasonable thereafter pursuant to the terms of such Definitive Agreement (Vendor). If, during the Negotiation Period (Vendor), the Vendor and the Purchaser are unable to agree on the terms of, and enter into, the Definitive Agreement (Vendor), then, on the earlier of (i) the last day of the Negotiation Period (Vendor), and (ii) the day on which the Vendor and the Purchaser agree that negotiations have ended, the Purchaser may commence negotiations with a third party for the sale of the Purchaser Copper Right which is the subject of the Purchaser Offer, and, either directly or through an Affiliate, sell the Purchaser Copper Right that is the subject of the Purchaser Offer to a third party, provided that the terms of sale are no more favourable to such third party than those offered to the Vendor in the Purchaser Offer.  
     
  (c)                                     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.2 shall not apply to any (i) copper spot sales, copper forward sales or options or other copper sales or copper loans to a financial institution or copper industry participant, (ii) internal transfers among Purchaser and its Affiliates, (iii) a sale of substantially all of the assets of the Purchaser, (iv) the sale of an equity interest in the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or (v) any Transfer under Section 10.2.

Vendor shall have five (5) Business Days, to 
     
 14   

dispute the Apportionment by delivery of a written notice to Purchaser (the   Combination Transaction Dispute Notice  ), which notice shall contain Vendor s proposed Apportionment.  If Vendor fails to deliver a Combination Transaction Dispute Notice within such five (5) Business Day period, Vendor shall be deemed to have accepted the Apportionment for purposes of this Section 9.2.  If Vendor timely delivers a Combination Transaction Dispute Notice, then the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to try to agree on the Apportionment and, if necessary, the identity of an Appraiser to determine the Apportionment.  If the Parties fail to reach agreement on an Appraiser within three (3) Business Days from the date of delivery of the Combination Transaction Dispute Notice, then Purchaser shall immediately submit the name and qualifications of its proposed Appraiser to Vendor (the   Purchaser Appraiser  ). Vendor shall have five (5) Business Days from expiry of such three (3) Business Day period to accept the Purchaser Appraiser as the sole appraiser of the dispute.  If the Vendor accepts the Purchaser Appraiser as the sole appraiser of the dispute (the   Agreed Appraiser  ), the Apportionment shall be determined by such Agreed Appraiser as set forth below.  If the Vendor fails to accept the Purchaser Appraiser as the sole appraiser of the dispute within such five (5) Business Day period, then the Vendor shall select an appraiser (the   Vendor Appraiser  ) and notify Purchaser of the identity of the Vendor Appraiser within such five (5) Business Day period.  Within the three (3) Business Days following the selection of the Vendor Appraiser, each of the Vendor Appraiser and the Purchaser Appraiser shall, acting reasonably, attempt to agree on a third person to act as an Appraiser (the   Third Appraiser  ) and failing agreement between them nominate three (3) persons to serve as a potential Third Appraiser.  If such lists contain a single common person, such person shall be the Third Appraiser hereunder.  If such lists contain more than one common person, the Third Appraiser shall be selected by lot among such common persons.  If such lists do not contain any common persons, then the Vendor Appraiser and Purchaser Appraiser shall, acting reasonably, attempt to agree on a Third Appraiser and failing agreement between them continue to nominate three (3) additional persons on each successive Business Day thereafter until one or more common persons are contained on such lists, following which the Third Appraiser shall be determined as set forth above.   The Apportionment shall be determined as follows:  
     
  (i)                                        If there is an Agreed Appraiser, such Agreed Appraiser shall submit to the Parties a report within seven (7) Business Days of its engagement setting forth the Apportionment. The expenses of the Agreed Appraiser shall be borne equally by the Parties.  The determination of the Agreed Appraiser as to the Apportionment shall be final and binding upon all parties (absent manifest or clerical error). 
     
  (ii)                                     If there is not an Agreed Appraiser, then each of the Vendor Appraiser, the Purchaser Appraiser and the Third Appraiser shall submit to the Parties a report within seven (7) Business Days of their respective engagements setting forth each such Appraiser s determination of the Apportionment.  The expenses of the Vendor Appraiser shall be borne by Vendor, the expenses of the Purchaser Appraiser shall be borne by Purchaser, and the expenses of the Third Appraiser shall be born equally by the Parties.  The calculations of each Appraiser shall be final and binding for purposes of the following sentence (absent manifest or clerical error).  If this Section 9.2(d)(ii) is applicable, the  Apportionment  for purposes of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the average of the determination of each of the Vendor Appraiser, the Purchaser Appraiser and the Third Appraiser.  The Appraisers shall act as, and shall be deemed to act as, experts and not arbitrators. 
     
 15   

The Apportionment, as mutually agreed upon between the Parties or as resolved pursuant to this Section 9.2(d), shall be deemed to be the purchase price of the Purchaser Copper Right for purposes of the last clause the last sentence of Section 9.2(b).  
     
   7.                                           Amendment to Section 10.5(a) of the Existing Agreement.

If it is held that the claims of the Senior Debt Secured Parties and the Purchaser in respect of the Collateral constitute claims in the same class, then the Senior Debt Secured Parties and the Purchaser hereby acknowledge and agree that all distributions shall be made as if there were separate classes of Senior Debt Obligation claims and Royal Gold Obligation claims against the Vendor (with the effect being that, to the extent that the aggregate value of the Senior Debt Priority Collateral or Royal Gold Priority Collateral is sufficient (for this purpose ignoring all claims held by the other Secured Parties), the Senior Debt Secured Parties or the Purchaser, respectively, shall be entitled to receive, in addition to amounts distributed to them in respect of principal, pre-petition interest and other claims, all amounts owing in respect of Post-Filing Interest that are available from each pool of Priority Collateral for each of the Senior Debt Secured Parties and the Purchaser, respectively, before any distribution is made in respect of the claims held by the other Secured Parties, with the other Secured Parties hereby acknowledging and agreeing to turn over to the respective other Secured Parties amounts otherwise received or receivable by them to the extent necessary to effectuate the intent of this sentence, even if such turnover has the effect of reducing the aggregate recoveries). The Purchaser further agrees that it will not support or vote in favor of any plan or similar arrangement (and shall be deemed to have voted to reject any plan or similar arrangement) that involves the Vendor and/or some or all of its affiliates and subsidiaries, unless such plan, arrangement, liquidation, reorganization, proposal, compromise or similar arrangement pursuant to or relating to any Insolvency Proceeding (a   Plan  ) (a) pays off, in immediately available funds, all Senior Debt Obligations or (b) is accepted by the Senior Debt Secured Parties voting thereon or (c) is supported by the Senior Debt Representative for the Senior Debt Secured Parties and the Senior Debt Representative for the Senior Debt Secured Parties so advises the Purchaser in writing (a   Senior Supported Plan  ). In the event that the Plan is supported by the Senior Debt Representative and the Senior Debt Representative has so advised the Purchaser in writing, the Purchaser shall vote in favor of such Senior Supported Plan so long as (i) in the event a Royal Gold Trigger Event has not occurred, the Plan provides that the rights of the Purchaser and the obligations of the Vendor under the Royal Gold Purchase Agreement and the Royal Gold Security Documents (whether such obligations are to be 
     
 11   

performed by the Vendor or a designee or other successor of the Vendor reasonably acceptable to Purchaser) are preserved in all material respects or (ii) in the event a Royal Gold Trigger Event has occurred, the Plan provides for the Purchaser receiving (A) all Royal Gold Priority Collateral (which, for greater certainty, the Purchaser has not already received) calculated and determined as at the date the Plan becomes effective in accordance with its terms or the equivalent value thereof in cash, and (B) without duplication, cash equal to the value of the Royal Gold Liens on all Collateral on the date set in the Insolvency Proceedings as the date for proving and valuing claims generally.

  (b)                                    Each of the Senior Debt Representative and the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that, to the extent that it holds, or a third party holds on its behalf, physical possession of or  control  (as defined in the PPSA or the STA, as applicable) over Collateral pursuant to the Senior Debt Security Documents or the Royal Gold Security Documents, as applicable, such possession or control is also for the benefit of the Purchaser or the Senior Debt Representative and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties, as applicable, solely to the extent required to perfect their security interest in such Collateral. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to impose any duty on the Senior Debt Representative or the Purchaser (or any third party acting on either such Person s behalf) with respect to such Collateral or provide the Purchaser, the Senior Debt Representative or any other Senior Debt Secured Party, as applicable, with any rights with respect to such Collateral beyond those specified in this Agreement, the Senior Debt Security Documents and the Royal Gold Security Documents, as applicable,  provided  that subsequent to the occurrence of the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date (so long as the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date shall not have occurred), the Senior Debt Representative shall (i) deliver to the Purchaser, at the Vendor s sole cost and expense, the Collateral in its possession or control together with any necessary endorsements to the extent required by the Royal Gold Documents or (ii) direct and deliver such Collateral as a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise directs;  provided ,  further , that subsequent to the occurrence of the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date (so long as the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date shall not have occurred), the Purchaser shall (i) deliver to the Senior Debt Representative, at the Vendor s sole cost and expense, the Collateral in its possession or control together with any necessary endorsements to the extent required by the Senior Debt Documents or (ii) direct and deliver such Collateral as a court of competent jurisdiction otherwise directs; provided, further, that (i) prior to the occurrence of the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date, upon the request of the Purchaser, the Senior Debt Representative shall turn over to the Purchaser any Royal Gold Priority Collateral of which it has physical possession, and (ii) prior to the occurrence of the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date, upon the request of the Senior Debt Representative, the Purchaser shall turn over to the Senior Debt Representative any Senior Debt Priority Collateral of which it has physical possession. The provisions of this Agreement are intended solely to 
     
 12   

govern the respective Lien priorities as between the Senior Debt Secured Parties and the Purchaser and shall not impose on the Senior Debt Secured Parties or the Purchaser any obligations in respect of the disposition of any Collateral (or any proceeds thereof) that would conflict with prior perfected Liens or any claims thereon in favor of any other Person that is not a Secured Party.  
     
  2.7                                   No Payment Subordination .  The subordination of any Liens herein constituted is with respect only to the priority of such Liens and shall not constitute a restriction on the obligations of the Vendor under the Royal Gold Purchase Agreement, or obligations of the Vendor under the Senior Debt Documents, as the case may be, or a subordination or postponement of any such obligations except as expressly provided in Section 4.1(a)(ii).  Any payment or delivery under the Royal Gold Documents, or any payment under the Senior Debt Documents, as the case may be, that is in each case made in accordance with this Agreement shall be made free and clear of any Liens as applicable.

(a) If the Vendor becomes subject to any Insolvency Proceeding at any time prior to the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date, and if the Senior Debt Representative or the other Senior Debt Secured Parties desire to consent (or not object) to the use of cash collateral under any Insolvency Law, to the extent applicable or to provide financing to the Vendor (the amount of which may exceed the US$350 million principal obligation limit in the Royal Gold Purchase Agreement) under applicable Insolvency Laws or to consent (or not object) to the provision of such financing to any Borrower Party by any third party (any such financing,   Senior Debt DIP Financing  ), then the Purchaser agrees that the Purchaser (i) will consent (and will be deemed hereunder to have consented) to, will raise no objection to, nor support any other Person objecting to, the use of such cash collateral or to such Senior Debt DIP Financing on any grounds and (ii) will subordinate (and will be deemed hereunder to have subordinated) the Royal Gold Liens on any Senior Debt Priority Collateral (A) to such Senior Debt DIP Financing on the same terms as the Senior Debt Liens are subordinated thereto (and such subordination will not alter in any manner the terms of this Agreement) and (B) to any court-ordered charge ranking senior to the Senior Debt Liens agreed to by the Senior Debt Representative or other Senior Debt Parties, so long as (x) the Purchaser retains its Lien on the Collateral to secure the Royal Gold Obligations (in each case, including Proceeds thereof arising after the commencement of the Insolvency Proceeding) and, as to the Royal Gold Priority Collateral only, such Lien has the same priority as existed prior to the commencement of the Insolvency Proceeding and any Lien securing such Senior Debt DIP Financing is junior and subordinate to the Lien of the Purchaser on the Royal Gold Priority Collateral, and (y) all Liens on Senior Debt Priority Collateral securing any such Senior Debt DIP Financing shall be senior to or on a parity with the Liens of the Senior Debt Representative and the Senior Debt Lenders securing the Senior Debt Obligations on Senior Debt Priority Collateral.  In no event will any of the Senior Debt Secured Parties seek to obtain a priming Lien to secure any Senior Debt DIP Financing on any of the Royal Gold Priority Collateral.  The Senior Debt Representative may seek the appointment of a Receiver by the court over all of the Collateral (including all or any part of the Royal Gold Priority Collateral) and propose to the court that it grant the Receiver priming liens over all such Collateral for funding the costs of the receivership as is customary in Canadian receivership proceedings;  provided , however, the Senior Debt Representative will not commence any Insolvency Proceeding for the appointment of a Receiver by a court with less notice to the Purchaser than is required by the applicable rules of court procedure, unless (i) the Senior Debt Representative reasonably determines that such an action is necessary to preserve and/or protect such Collateral from immediate damage or significant diminution in value and (ii) the Senior Debt Representative provides the Purchaser with no less than three (3) business day s prior written notice of the hearing of the application to the court, to the extent possible; provided, however, that the Senior Debt Representative will not have any personal liability to the Purchaser for failure to provide the Purchaser with such prior written notice. The immediately forgoing sentence is not intended and shall not be construed as a waiver by the Purchaser of any statutory right to receive earlier notice from the Senior Debt Representative or other Person in connection with the appointment of a Receiver or an application to the court for the appointment of a Receiver. In no event shall the Purchaser sell or obtain a priming lien on any Senior Debt Priority Collateral in any Insolvency Proceedings or otherwise. Notwithstanding the granting of any priming liens by a court in favor of a Receiver over such Collateral, all rights and obligations of the Purchaser and the Senior Debt Representative are intended to be and shall be deemed to be subject to the Lien Priority and other terms and conditions of this Agreement. 
     
 20   

(b)                                    All Liens granted to the Purchaser or the Senior Debt Representative in any Insolvency Proceeding are intended to be and shall be deemed to be subject to the Lien Priority and the other terms and conditions of this Agreement.

Until the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date, the Senior Debt Representative agrees, on behalf of itself and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties, that none of them will seek relief from any stay in any Insolvency Proceeding or take any action in derogation thereof, in each case in respect of any Royal Gold Priority Collateral, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser. In addition, neither the Purchaser nor the Senior Debt Representative shall seek any relief from any stay with respect to any Collateral without providing 30 days  prior written notice to the other, unless otherwise agreed by both the Senior Debt Representative and the Purchaser. 
     
  5.4                                   Interest, Fees and Expenses . (a) The Purchaser agrees that, prior to the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date, so long as the Senior Debt Representative and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties comply with  Section 5.4(b) , it shall not object, contest, or support any other Person objecting to or contesting the payment of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts to the Senior Debt Representative or any other Senior Debt Secured Party under applicable Insolvency Law. The Purchaser, further agrees that, prior to the Senior Debt Obligations Payment Date, none of them shall assert or enforce any claim under applicable Insolvency Law that is senior to or on a parity with the Senior Debt Liens for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Senior Debt Priority Collateral. 
     
  (b)                                    The Senior Debt Representative, on behalf of itself and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties, agrees that, prior to the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date, so long as the Purchaser complies with  Section 5.4(a) , none of them shall object, contest, or support any other Person objecting to or contesting the payment of interest, fees, expenses or other amounts to the Purchaser under applicable Insolvency Law. The Senior Debt Representative, on behalf of itself and the other Senior Debt Secured Parties, further agrees that, prior to the Royal Gold Obligations Payment Date, none of them shall assert or enforce any claim under applicable Insolvency Law that is senior to or on a parity with the Royal Gold Liens for costs or expenses of preserving or disposing of any Royal Gold Priority Collateral. 
     
  5.5                                   Avoidance Issues . If any Senior Secured Party is required in any Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise to disgorge, turn over or otherwise pay to the estate of the Vendor, because such amount was avoided or ordered to be paid or disgorged for any reason, including without limitation because it was found to be a preference or transfer at undervalue, any amount (a   Recovery  ), whether received as proceeds of security, enforcement of any right of set-off or otherwise, then the Senior Obligations shall be reinstated to the extent of such Recovery and deemed to be outstanding as if such payment had not occurred and the Senior Obligations Payment Date shall be deemed not to have occurred. If this Agreement shall have been terminated prior to such Recovery, this Agreement shall be reinstated in full force and effect, and such prior termination shall not diminish, release, discharge, impair or otherwise affect the obligations of the parties hereto. The Junior Secured Parties agree that none of them shall be 
     
 21   

entitled to benefit from any avoidance action affecting or otherwise relating to any distribution or allocation made in accordance with this Agreement, whether by preference or otherwise, it being understood and agreed that the benefit of such avoidance action otherwise allocable to them shall instead be allocated and turned over for application in accordance with the priorities set forth in this Agreement.  
     
  5.6                                   Asset Dispositions in an Insolvency Proceeding . (a) The Purchaser shall not, in an Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, oppose any sale or disposition of any Senior Debt Priority Collateral (including any credit bid by the Senior Debt Representative or by any Senior Debt Secured Parties) that is supported by the Senior Debt Secured Parties, and the Purchaser will consent (and will be deemed hereunder to have consented), under the applicable Insolvency Laws to any sale of any Senior Debt Priority Collateral supported by the Senior Debt Secured Parties and to have released the Junior Liens on such assets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is agreed that no Senior Debt Secured Party shall convey or approve a transfer of any mineral tenures necessary or desirable for the extraction of gold at the Milligan Property without requiring such transferee to agree in writing that its interests in such mineral tenures are subject to the obligations of the Vendor under the Royal Gold Purchase Agreement;  provided  that the Purchaser shall not oppose any such transfer of mineral tenures in compliance with the foregoing requirement. 
     
  (b)                                    Neither the Senior Debt Representative nor any Senior Debt Secured Party shall, in an Insolvency Proceeding or otherwise, oppose any sale or disposition of any Royal Gold Priority Collateral (including any credit bid by the Purchaser) that is supported by the Purchaser, and the Senior Debt Representative and the Senior Debt Secured Parties will consent (and will be deemed hereunder to have consented) under applicable Insolvency Law, to any sale of any Royal Gold Priority Collateral supported by the Purchaser and to have released the Junior Liens on such assets. 
     
  (c)                                     For certainty, nothing in this Section 5.6 is intended to prevent any Secured Party from making a credit bid for Collateral in respect of which it holds a Junior Lien provided such bid contemplates payment in full on closing of all Senior Obligations secured by a Senior Lien on such Collateral. 
     
  5.7                                   Other Matters .  To the extent that the Senior Representative or any Senior Secured Party has or acquires rights, under applicable Insolvency Law, with respect to any of the Collateral on which it has a Junior Lien, such Senior Representative agrees, on behalf of itself and the other Senior Secured Parties, not to assert any of such rights without the prior written consent of the Junior Representative;  provided  that if requested by the Junior Representative, such Senior Representative shall timely exercise such rights in the manner requested by the Junior Representative, including any rights to payments in respect of such rights.

  Dear Jason and Tony:  
     
  Further to our recent discussions, Centerra Gold Inc. (  we   or   Centerra  ) has advised each of RGLD Gold AG (  RGLD  ) and Royal Gold, Inc. (  Royal Gold   and, together with RGLD,   RG  ), that we intend to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc. (  TCM  ) (the   Acquisition  ) pursuant to an arrangement agreement (the   Arrangement Agreement  ) between Centerra and TCM. Centerra will hold TCM through a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary (  AcquireCo  ).  
     
  This commitment letter, together with the term sheet attached hereto as Schedule  A  (the   Term Sheet  ) is hereinafter referred to as the   Commitment Letter  .

(  Terrane  ), RGLD, and, solely in respect of certain provisions of the Stream Agreement as set forth therein, Royal Gold and TCM, relating to the Mt. Milligan copper-gold mine, located in British Columbia, and owned by Terrane (the   Project  ).  
     
  RGLD, acknowledging that Centerra is entering into this Commitment Letter in reliance thereon, hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth on  Annex 1  hereto, with respect to RGLD.  
     
  Royal Gold, acknowledging that Centerra is entering into this Commitment Letter in reliance thereon, hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth on  Annex 2  hereto, with respect to Royal Gold.  

Centerra, acknowledging that RG is entering into this Commitment Letter in reliance thereon, hereby makes the representations and warranties set forth on  Annex 3  hereto.  
     
  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Term Sheet, RGLD, Royal Gold and Centerra commit to take (or cause to be taken), simultaneously with the closing of the Acquisition, all necessary steps to consummate the RGLD Amendment, effective upon the closing of the Acquisition.  
     
  On or prior to the closing of the RGLD Amendment, RGLD shall execute and deliver a satisfactory intercreditor agreement (the   Intercreditor Agreement  ) with Terrane and The Bank of Nova Scotia, substantially in the form and on the terms of the intercreditor agreement dated as of November 29, 2012 entered into among JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., RGLD and Terrane (the   Existing Intercreditor Agreement  ) reflecting the amendment contemplated by the RGLD Amendment and the $325m financing contemplated between The Bank of Nova Scotia and AcquireCo. As a statement of principle, RGLD hereby confirms its satisfaction with the substance of the Existing Intercreditor Agreement provisions pertaining to lien priority and subordination, enforcement, standstill and waivers, disposition and application of proceeds of senior collateral and asset dispositions in an insolvency proceeding and that such provisions shall in substance be incorporated into the Intercreditor Agreement (except that RGLD shall obtain a first priority security interest in its copper interest as described in the Term Sheet).  
     
  Prior to the consummation of the RGLD Amendment, Centerra shall, upon becoming aware of any one of the following, promptly notify RG (it being understood that Centerra shall satisfy its notice obligations in this paragraph in respect of a particular matter if it publicly discloses such matter): (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event that the occurrence or failure of which has caused or could reasonably be expected to result in Centerra s failure to satisfy any condition specified herein (including the Term Sheet); (ii) any failure of Centerra to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement set out in the Term Sheet to be complied with or satisfied prior to the consummation of the RGLD Amendment; (iii) any written notice or other communication from any governmental authority in connection with the RGLD Amendment; and (iv) any material litigation, legal action, arbitration, proceeding, mediation, demand, claim or investigation (collectively,   Legal Proceedings  ) commenced or, to the knowledge of Centerra, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting Centerra that relate to the consummation of the Acquisition or the RGLD Amendment.  
     
  Prior to the consummation of the RGLD Amendment, RG shall promptly disclose its knowledge of the following to Centerra: (i) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event that the occurrence or failure of which has caused or could reasonably be expected to result in RG s failure to satisfy any condition specified herein  (including the Term Sheet); (ii) any failure of RG to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied prior to consummation of the RGLD Amendment; (iii) any written notice or other communication from any governmental authority in connection with the RGLD Amendment; and (iv) any Legal Proceedings commenced or, to the knowledge of RG, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting RG that relate to the consummation of the RGLD Amendment. 
     
  The obligations of the parties under this Commitment Letter shall terminate upon the earlier of (i) the closing of the RGLD Amendment, (ii) November 30, 2016 (or such later date as Centerra and RG may agree), (iii) the date of the termination of the Arrangement Agreement or abandonment of the Acquisition, and (iv) the date, if any, on which the shareholders of TCM decline to approve the Acquisition.  

The existence and terms and conditions of this Commitment Letter will be publicly disclosed as part of the public announcement of the Acquisition.  
     
  This Commitment Letter is a binding agreement of the parties. This Commitment Letter shall be subject to and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein. This Commitment Letter may not be amended or waived except by an instrument signed by each of the parties.

Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses associated with this Commitment Letter and any negotiation, preparation and execution of the definitive documentation for the RGLD Amendment and the Intercreditor Agreement. 
     
  Subject to and without derogating from the binding nature of this Commitment Letter, nothing in this Commitment Letter shall: (i) limit RG s rights and remedies under the Stream Agreement or its related security in any manner; or (ii) prevent RG from exercising (including asserting, protecting and enforcing) their rights and remedies under the Stream Agreement.  
     
  From the date hereof until the earlier of the termination of this Commitment Letter and the closing of the RGLD Amendment: (i) neither RG nor any of its Affiliates shall, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, or encourage any inquiries, proposals or offers from, discuss or negotiate with, provide any non-public information to, or consider the merits of any inquiries or proposals from, or enter into any agreement with, any person (other than Centerra) relating to the obligations of TCM and its Affiliates under the Stream Agreement (including any amendments to, or the termination of, the Stream Agreement); and (ii) RG shall promptly notify Centerra in writing if any person makes any inquiry, proposal or offer relating to the obligations of TCM and its Affiliates under the Stream Agreement (including any amendments to, or the termination of, the Stream Agreement).  
     
  If you are in agreement with the terms and conditions set out herein (including the Term Sheet), kindly execute and return to Centerra a copy of this Commitment Letter as evidence of your acceptance of the foregoing not later than 3:00 p.m., Toronto time, on July 5, 2016.
