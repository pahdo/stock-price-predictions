NOTE 1   BASIS OF
PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

The accompanying
unaudited consolidated condensed financial statements have been
prepared by Command Center, Inc. ( Command, 
 us,   we,  or  our ) in
accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly,
certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been
condensed or omitted. In the opinion of our management, all
adjustments, consisting of only normal recurring accruals,
necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows for the fiscal periods
presented have been included. 

These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and related notes included in our Annual Report filed on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 25, 2015. The results of
operations for the thirteen and thirty-nine weeks ended September
23, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for
the full fiscal year, or for any other fiscal period. 

Consolidation:   The
consolidated condensed financial statements include the accounts of
Command and all of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. 

Reclassifications:   Certain
financial statement amounts for the prior period have been
reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These
reclassifications had no effect on the net income or accumulated
deficit as previously reported. 

Cash and Cash
Equivalents:   Cash and cash equivalents consist of
demand deposits, including interest-bearing accounts with original
maturities of three months or less, held in banking institutions
and a trust account. These accounts are guaranteed by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) up to $250,000
per institution. As of September 23, 2016 and December 25, 2015, we
held deposits in excess of FDIC insured limits of approximately
$174,000 and $7.2 million, respectively. 

Concentrations:   At
December 25, 2015, 11.5% of accounts payable were due to a single
vendor.  At September 23, 2016, 16.1% of accounts payable
were due to a single vendor. 

Use of
Estimates:   The preparation of consolidated
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the
reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements:   In August 2014, the FASB
issued ASU 2014-15 requiring management to evaluate whether there
are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise
substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a
going concern, which is currently performed by the external
auditors. Management will be required to perform this assessment
for both interim and annual reporting periods and must make certain
disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt exists. This ASU
is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those
annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2016. The
adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect
on our financial statements.   

In May
2014, the FASB issued new revenue recognition guidance under ASU
2014-09 that will supersede the existing revenue recognition
guidance under U.S. GAAP. The new standard focuses on creating a
single source of revenue guidance for revenue arising from
contracts with customers for all industries. The objective of the
new standard is for companies to recognize revenue when it
transfers the promised goods or services to its customers at an
amount that represents what the company expects to be entitled to
in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB
deferred the effective date by one year (ASU 2015-14). This ASU
will now be effective for annual periods, and interim periods
within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15,
2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original
effective date of December 15, 2016. Since the issuance of the
original standard, the FASB has issued several other subsequent
updates including the following: 1) clarification of the
implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations
(ASU 2016-08); 2) further guidance on identifying performance
obligations in a contract as well as clarifications on the
licensing implementation guidance (ASU 2016-10); 3) rescission of
several SEC Staff Announcements that are codified in Topic 605 (ASU
2016-11); and 4) additional guidance and practical expedients in
response to identified implementation issues (ASU 2016-12). The new
standard will be effective for us beginning January 1, 2018 and we
expect to implement the standard with the modified retrospective
approach, which recognizes the cumulative effect of application
recognized on that date. We are evaluating the impact of adoption
on our consolidated results of operations, consolidated financial
position and cash flows. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 amending the existing
accounting standards for lease accounting and requiring lessees to
recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for all leases with
lease terms of more than 12 months, including those classified as
operating leases. Both the asset and liability will initially be
measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments,
with the asset being subject to adjustments such as initial direct
costs. Consistent with current U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles ( GAAP ), the presentation of expenses and
cash flows will depend primarily on the classification of the lease
as either a finance or an operating lease. The new standard also
requires additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures
regarding the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising
from leases in order to provide additional information about the
nature of an organization s leasing activities. This ASU is
effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those
annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2018 and requires
modified retrospective application. Early adoption is permitted. We
are currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our
consolidated financial statements and related
disclosures.

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update
( ASU ) 2016-09 amending several aspects of share-based
payment accounting. This guidance requires all excess tax benefits
and tax deficiencies to be recorded in the income statement when
the awards vest or are settled, with prospective application
required. The guidance also changes the classification of such tax
benefits or tax deficiencies on the statement of cash flows from a
financing activity to an operating activity, with retrospective or
prospective application allowed. Additionally, the guidance
requires the classification of employee taxes paid when an employer
withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes as a financing
activity on the statement of cash flows, with retrospective
application required. This ASU is effective for annual periods, and
interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after
December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently
evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures. 

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606):  Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  ( ASU
2016-08 ). ASU 2016-08 does not change the core principle of
Topic 606 but clarifies the implementation guidance on principal
versus agent considerations. ASU 2016-08 is effective for the
annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We
are currently assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-08 on our
consolidated financial statements and results of
operations. 

In June
2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses 
( ASU 2016-13 ). ASU 2016-13 changes the impairment
model for most financial assets and certain other instruments,
including trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt
securities and loans, and requires entities to use a new
forward-looking expected loss model that will result in the earlier
recognition of allowance for losses. This update is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for
a fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim
periods within that fiscal year. Entities will apply the standard's
provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings
as of the beginning   of the first
reporting period in which the guidance is adopted. We are currently
assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated
financial statements and results of operations. 

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows
(Topic 230):  Classification of
Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU
2016-15 reduces diversity in practice in how certain transactions
are classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in
ASU 2016-15 provide guidance on specific cash flow issues including
debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of
zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon
interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective
interest rate of the borrowing, contingent consideration payments
made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of
insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned
life insurance policies, and distributions received from equity
method investees. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently
assessing the potential impact of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated
financial statements and results of operations. 

Other accounting
standards that have been issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board or other standards-setting bodies are not expected
to have a material impact on our financial position, results of
operations and cash flows. For period ended September 23, 2016, the
adoption of other accounting standards had no material impact on
our financial positions, results of operations, or cash
flows. 

NOTE 2   EARNINGS PER SHARE  

Basic earnings per
share is calculated by dividing net income or loss available to
common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares
outstanding, and does not include the impact of any potentially
dilutive common stock equivalents. Diluted earnings per share
reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in
our earnings through the conversion of common shares issuable via
outstanding stock options and stock warrants, except where their
inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Total outstanding common stock
equivalents at September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015 were
3,303,000 and 3,728,500 respectively. 

7 

Diluted common
shares outstanding were calculated using the treasury stock method
and are as follows: 

NOTE 3   ACCOUNT PURCHASE AGREEMENT  

In May 2016, we
signed a new Account Purchase Agreement with our lender, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. The agreement allows us to sell eligible accounts
receivable for 90% of the invoiced amount on a full recourse basis
up to the facility maximum, $14 million. When the receivable is
collected, the remaining 10% is paid to us, less applicable fees
and interest. At September 23, 2016 and December 25, 2015, the
Account Purchase Agreement Facility had a balance of $71,615 and
$479,616, respectively. At September 23, 2016 the gross value of
accounts receivable sold under this agreement (collateral) was
approximately $8.3 million. The term of the agreement is through
April 7, 2018. The agreement bears interest at the Daily One Month
London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.5% per annum. At
September 23, 2016, the effective interest rate was 3.01%. Interest
is payable on the actual amount advanced. Additional charges
include an annual facility fee equal to 0.50% of the facility
threshold in place and lockbox fees. As collateral for repayment of
any and all obligations, we granted Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. a
security interest in all of our property including, but not limited
to, accounts receivable, intangible assets, contract rights,
investment property, deposit accounts, and other such
assets.   

At September 23,
2016, we had an outstanding letter of credit in the amount of $5.7
million issued under this agreement which we use as a collateral
deposit with our workers  compensation insurance provider.
The letter of credit reduces the amount of funds available under
this agreement. 

The agreement
requires that the sum of our unrestricted cash plus net accounts
receivable must at all times be greater than the sum of the amount
outstanding under the agreement plus accrued payroll and accrued
payroll taxes. At September 23, 2016, we were in compliance with
this covenant. 

NOTE 4   ACQUISITION  

On June 3, 2016 we
purchased substantially all the assets of Hanwood Arkansas, LLC, an
Arkansas limited liability company, and Hanwood Oklahoma, LLC, an
Oklahoma limited liability company.  Together these
companies operated as Hancock Staffing from offices located in
Little Rock, Arkansas and Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.  We
acquired all of the assets used in connection with the operation of
the two staffing offices.  In addition, we assumed
liabilities for future payments due under the leases for the two
offices, amounts owed on motor vehicles acquired, and the amount
due on their receivables factoring line. This transaction was
accounted for under the purchase method in accordance
with FASB Accounting Standards Codification Topic ASC 805,
Business Combinations. 

The
aggregate consideration paid for Hancock was $2,685,145, paid as
follows: (i) cash of $1,980,000; (ii) an unsecured one-year
holdback obligation of $220,000; and (iii) assumed liabilities of
$485,145. 

In
connection with the acquisition of Hancock, we identified and
recognized an intangible asset of $659,564 representing customer
relationships and employment agreements/non-compete agreements. The
customer relationships are being amortized on a straight line basis
over their estimated life of four (4) years and the non-compete
agreement is amortized over its two-year term. During the thirteen
and thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016 we recognized
amortization expense of $62,685 and $74,012, respectively. We will
recognize amortization expense of $55,509 in the remainder of
fiscal year ending 2016, $222,034 in the fiscal year ending 2017,
$155,367 in the fiscal year ending 2018, $107,746 in the fiscal
years 2019 and $44,896 in the fiscal year 2020. At September 23,
2016 the Intangible asset balance, net of accumulated amortization,
is $585,552.

The following table
summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed at the date of acquisition, which have now been
recorded in the financial statements as of September 23,
2016:   

NOTE 5   WORKERS' COMPENSATION INSURANCE AND
RESERVES  

On April 1, 2014,
we changed our workers  compensation carrier to ACE American
Insurance Company ( ACE ) in all states in which we
operate other than Washington and North Dakota. ACE has acquired
Chubb Corp. and is now known as Chubb.  The Chubb
insurance policy is a large deductible policy where we have primary
responsibility for all claims made. Chubb provides insurance for
covered losses and expenses in excess of $500,000 per incident.
Under this high deductible program, we are largely self-insured.
Per our contractual agreements with Chubb, we must provide a
collateral deposit of $5.7 million, which is accomplished through a
letter of credit under our Account Purchase Agreement with Wells
Fargo.  For workers  compensation claims
originating in Washington and North Dakota, we pay workers 
compensation insurance premiums and obtain full coverage under
mandatory government administered programs. Our liability
associated with claims in these jurisdictions is limited to the
payment of premiums. 

As part of our
large deductible workers  compensation programs, our carriers
require that we collateralize a portion of our future
workers  compensation obligations in order to secure future
payments made on our behalf. This collateral is typically in the
form of cash and cash equivalents. At September 23, 2016 and
December 25, 2015, we had net cash collateral deposits of
approximately $2.4 million. With the addition of the $5.7 million
letter of credit, our cash and non-cash collateral totaled
approximately $8.1 million at September 23, 2016. The
workers  compensation risk pool deposits total $2,413,033 as
of September 23, 2016, consisting of a current portion of $406,219
and a long-term portion of $2,006,814. The long-term portion of the
risk pool deposits is net of an allowance of $0.5 million, which is
determined to be impaired. This allowance is to reserve for the
possibility that we would not recover all of our risk pool deposits
that we placed with our former workers  compensation
insurance carrier, Freestone Insurance (formerly Dallas National
Insurance Company.) Freestone Insurance was placed in receivership
by the State of Delaware in 2014. We continue to believe that we
have a priority claim for the return of our collateral. However,
the amount that will ultimately be returned to us is still
uncertain. See  Note 7  
Commitments and Contingencies,  for additional information on
cash collateral provided to Freestone Insurance
Company.   

Workers'
compensation expense for temporary workers is recorded as a
component of our cost of staffing services and totaled
approximately $2.8 million and $2.1 million for the thirty-nine
week periods ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015,
respectively.  During the first three quarters of 2015 we
recognized an approximate $700,000 cumulative benefit from the
actuarial adjustment to our prior year s workers compensation
liability. 

NOTE 6   STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  

Our 2008 Stock
Incentive Plan expired in January 2016.  Outstanding
awards continue to remain in effect according to the terms of the
plan and the award documents.  The Stock Incentive Plan
permitted the grant of up to 6.4 million stock options in order to
motivate, attract and retain the services of employees, officers
and directors, and to provide an incentive for outstanding
performance. Pursuant to awards under this plan, there were
2,195,500 and 1,671,616 options vested at September 23, 2016 and
December 25, 2015, respectively.

The following table
summarizes our stock options outstanding at December 25, 2015 and
changes during the period ended September 23, 2016: 

The following table
summarizes our non-vested stock options outstanding at December 25,
2015, and changes during the period ended September 23,

The following table
summarizes information about our stock options outstanding, and
reflects the intrinsic value recalculated based on the closing
price of our common stock at September 23, 2016: 

We recognized
share-based compensation expense relating to the vesting of issued
stock options of approximately $40,000 and $163,000 for the
thirteen week, and $196,600 and $420,000 for the thirty-nine week
periods ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015,
respectively.  At September 23, 2016, there was
unrecognized share-based compensation expense totaling
approximately $133,000 relating to non-vested options and
restricted share grants that will be recognized over the next 2.5
years. 

During 2015, we
granted 647,000 shares of restricted common stock to
employees.  The shares were to vest on October 31, 2016,
if the grantee was still an employee.  During 2016, the
grant was terminated and no restricted common stock will be earned
by employees or issued. 

Stock
Repurchase:   In April 2015, the Board of Directors
authorized a $5.0 million three year repurchase of our common
stock.  During the third quarter of 2016 we purchased
1,238,919 shares of common stock at an aggregate price of
approximately $499,000 resulting in an average price of $0.40 per
share under the plan. These shares were then retired. We have
approximately $2.2 million remaining under the plan.  The
table below summarizes our common stock purchases during the third
quarter of 2016.

NOTE 7   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  

Legal
Proceedings:  From time to time we are involved in
various legal proceedings. We believe that the outcome of these
proceedings, even if determined adversely, will not have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations. There have been no material changes in our legal
proceedings since December 25, 2015. 

Freestone Insurance Company
Liquidation:  

For the
two-year period prior to April 1, 2014, our workers 
compensation insurance coverage was provided by Dallas National
Insurance under a high deductible policy in which we are
responsible for the first $350,000 per incident.  During
this time period, Dallas National changed its corporate name to
Freestone Insurance Company. Under the terms of the policy we were
required to provide cash collateral of $900,000 per year for a
total of $1.8 million, as a non-depleting fund to secure our
payment of anticipated claims up to the policy
deductible.  We are ultimately responsible for paying
costs of claims that occur during the term of the policy, up to the
deductible amount.  In January 2014, Freestone Insurance
provided written confirmation to us that it continued to hold $1.8
million of Command funds as collateral and stated that an
additional $200,000 was held at another insurance
provider.  In April 2014, the State of Delaware placed
Freestone Insurance in receivership due to concerns about its
financial condition.  On August 15, 2014, the
receivership was converted to a liquidation proceeding. The
receiver distributed pending individual claims for workers 
compensation benefits to the respective state guaranty funds for
administration. In many cases, the state guaranty funds have made
payments directly to the claimants. In other situations we have
continued to pay claims that are below the deductible level and we
are not aware of any pending claims from this time period that
exceed or are likely to exceed our deductible. 

From
about July 1, 2008 until April 1, 2011, in most states our
workers  compensation coverage was provided under an
agreement with AMS Staff Leasing II, through a master policy with
Dallas National. During this time period, we deposited
approximately $500,000 with an affiliate of Dallas National for
collateral related to the coverage through AMS Staff Leasing II.
Claims that remain open from this time period have also been
distributed by the receiver to the state guaranty funds. In one
instance, the State of Minnesota has denied liability for payment
of a workers  compensation claim that arose in 2010 and is in
excess of our deductible. In the first quarter of this year, we
settled the individual workers  compensation case and have
legally challenged the State s denial of
liability. 

During
the second quarter of 2015, the receiver requested court
authorization to disburse funds to the state guaranty funds. We and
other depositors of collateral with Freestone objected and asked
the court to block the disbursements until a full accounting of the
assets and liabilities of Freestone is provided. Distribution of
funds by the receiver to the state guaranty funds remains on hold.
As a result of these developments, during the second quarters of
each 2015 and 2016 we recorded reserves of $250,000 on the deposit
balance, for a total reserve of $500,000. We review these deposits
at each balance sheet date and as of September 23, 2016, we did not
need to make an adjustment to our deposit balance. 

On July
5, 2016, the receiver filed the First Accounting with the Delaware
Court of Chancery. The First Accounting does not clarify the issues
with respect to the collateral claims, priorities and return of
collateral. In the accounting, the Receiver reports total assets of
$87.7 million as of December 31, 2015. 

In late
2015, we filed timely proofs of claim with the receiver. One proof
of claim is filed as a priority claim seeking return of the full
amount of our collateral deposits. The other proof of claim is a
general claim covering non-collateral items. We believe that our
claim to the return of our collateral is a priority claim in the
liquidation proceeding and that our collateral should be returned
to us. However, if it is ultimately determined that our claim is
not a priority claim or if there are insufficient assets in the
liquidation to satisfy the priority claims, we may not receive any
or all of our collateral. 

NOTE 8   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

On September 29,
2016, the Board of Directors approved the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan
(the  2016 Plan ) and directed that the 2016 Plan be
submitted to a vote of the shareholders at the annual meeting,
which has been scheduled for November 17, 2016. The stated purpose
of the 2016 Plan is to attract, retain and motivate employees,
officers, directors, consultants and advisors of the Company and to
align their interests of our shareholders. Upon approval by the
shareholders, the 2016 Plan will make up to 6,000,000 shares
available for awards over the 10 year term of the 2016
Plan.

Forward Looking
Statements:   This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q
contains  forward-looking statements  within the
meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
Forward-looking statements include statements regarding industry
trends, our future financial position and performance, business
strategy, revenues and expenses in future periods, projected levels
of growth and other matters that do not relate strictly to
historical facts. These statements are often identified by words
such as  may,   will,   seeks, 
 anticipates,   believes, 
 estimates,   expects, 
 projects,   forecasts, 
 plans,   intends,   continue, 
 could,   should  or similar expressions or
variations. These statements are based on the beliefs and
expectations of our management based on information currently
available. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of
future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties that
could cause actual results to differ materially from those
contemplated by forward-looking statements. Important factors
currently known to our management that could cause or contribute to
such differences include, but are not limited to, those referenced
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25,
2015 under Item 1A  Risk Factors.  We undertake no
obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of
new information, future events or otherwise. 

Overview 

Command Center,
Inc. ( Command,   us,   we,  or
 our ) is a staffing company operating primarily in the
manual labor segment of the staffing industry. Our customers range
in size from small businesses to large corporations. All of our
temporary workers are employed by us. Most of our work assignments
are short term, and many are filled on little notice from our
customers. In addition to short and longer term temporary work
assignments, we recruit and place workers in temp-to-hire
positions. 

At September
23, 2016, we owned and operated 61 on-demand labor stores in 21
states.  

Results
of Operations 

The following table
reflects operating results for the thirteen week  and thirty-nine
week  periods ended September 23, 2016 compared to the 
 thirteen week and
thirty-nine week periods  ended September 25, 2015 (in
thousands, except per share amounts and percentages) and serves as
the basis for the narrative that follows. Percentages indicate line
items as a percentage of total revenue. 

Earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and non-cash
compensation (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP measure that represents net
income attributable to Command before interest expense, income tax
benefit (expense), depreciation and amortization, and non-cash
compensation. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, and non-cash compensation (Adjusted
EBITDA) is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income
attributable to Command before interest expense, income tax benefit
(expense), depreciation and amortization, non-cash compensation and
certain non-recurring charges. We utilize EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA as financial measures as management believes investors find
them to be useful tools to perform more meaningful comparisons of
past, present and future operating results and as a means to
evaluate our results of operations. We believe these metrics are
useful complements to net income and other financial performance
measures. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not intended to represent
net income as defined by U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles ( GAAP ), and such information should not be
considered as an alternative to net income or any other measure of
performance prescribed by GAAP. 

12 

We use EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA to measure our financial performance because we
believe interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, non-cash
compensation and certain non-recurring charges bear little or no
relationship to our operating performance. By excluding interest
expense, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measure our financial
performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance
our operations. By excluding taxes on income, we believe EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA provide a basis for measuring the financial
performance of our operations excluding factors that our branches
cannot control. By excluding depreciation and amortization expense,
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA measure the financial performance of our
operations without regard to their historical cost. By excluding
stock based compensation, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide a
basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations. In
addition, by excluding certain nonrecurring charges Adjusted EBITDA
provides a basis for measuring financial performance without
unusual nonrecurring charges. For all of these reasons, we believe
that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA provide us and investors with
information that is relevant and useful in evaluating our business.
However, because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exclude depreciation
and amortization, they do not measure the capital we require to
maintain or preserve our fixed assets. In addition, EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest expense, and do not take
into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding
debt, nor do they show trends in interest costs due to changes in
our financing or changes in interest rates. EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA, as defined by us, may not be comparable to EBITDA and
Adjusted EBITDA as reported by other companies that do not define
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA exactly as we define those terms.
Because we use EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our financial
performance, we reconcile them to net income, which is the most
comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance
with GAAP.   

The following is a
reconciliation of EBITDA to net income for the periods
presented: 

The following is a
reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income for the periods

Thirteen Weeks Ended September 23, 2016  

Summary of
Operations:  Revenue for the thirteen weeks ended September
23, 2016 was $26.4 million, an increase of approximately $1.6
million or 6.4%, when compared to the third quarter of 2015. In
June 2016, we acquired the assets of Hanwood Oklahoma, LLC,
operating a branch in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Hanwood Arkansas,
LLC, operating a branch in Little Rock, Arkansas (collectively
referred to as  Hancock .) For the quarter ended
September 23, 2016, revenue from the Hancock branches was
approximately $2.0 million or 7.7% of our revenue in the third
quarter. Revenue from our branches in North Dakota fell by
approximately $1.4 million or 31.5% from the third quarter of 2015.
This decrease in North Dakota revenue is due to the decline in
demand for temporary staffing services in the Bakken region of
North Dakota. Revenue from our remaining branches (excluding
Hancock and North Dakota) was approximately $21.0 million, an
increase of $1.0 million or 4.3% from the third quarter of
2015. 

We
continue to focus on improving same store sales and margins as a
way to increase revenue and profitability, as well as to open
additional branches when economically feasible to do
so. 

Our
branches serve a wide variety of clients and industries across 21
states. Our individual branch revenue can fluctuate significantly
on both a quarter over quarter and year over year basis depending
on the local economic conditions and need for temporary labor
services in the local economy. We strive to increase the diversity
of clients and industries we service at both the branch and the
company level. We believe this will reduce the potential negative
impact of an economic downturn in any one industry or
region. 

Cost of Staffing
Services:  Cost of staffing services was 74.1% and 73.9% of
revenue for the thirteen weeks ended September 23, 2016 and
September 25, 2015, respectively. This increase is a nominal
quarter over quarter variation. 

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses ( SG A ):  SG A
expenses were 21.2% and 20.3% of revenue for the thirteen weeks
ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015, respectively. On
an absolute basis our SG A expense was approximately $547,000
or 10.8% higher in the third quarter of 2016 than in
2015. 

This
increase quarter over quarter was due to $249,000 of payroll tax
expense, $229,000 workers  compensation expense accrual based
on a percentage of payroll, and $302,000 bad debt expense for aged
invoices related to specific customers, offset by $140,000 decrease
in salaries due to a reduction in sales training staff, $144,000
reduction in stock based compensation due to the termination of the
December 2015 employee stock grant, and $84,000 reduction in legal
services. 

Thirty-nine Weeks Ended September 23, 2016 

Summary of
Operations:  Revenue for the thirty-nine weeks ended
September 23, 2016 was $67.2 million, a slight increase of
approximately $533,000 or 0.8%, when compared to  the thirty-nine
weeks ended  September 25, 2015. In June 2016, we acquired
the assets of Hanwood Oklahoma, LLC, operating a branch in Oklahoma
City, Oklahoma and Hanwood Arkansas, LLC, operating a branch in
Little Rock, Arkansas (collectively referred to as
 Hancock .) From the date of acquisition through
September 23, 2016, revenue from the Hancock branches was
approximately $2.5 million or 3.8% of our revenue for the first
thirty-nine weeks of the year. Revenue from our branches in North
Dakota fell by approximately $4.5 million or 38.3% from the first
thirty-nine weeks of 2015. This decrease in North Dakota revenue is
due to the decline in demand for temporary staffing services in the
Bakken region of North Dakota. Revenue from our remaining branches
(excluding Hancock and North Dakota) was $57.3 million, an increase
of $2.5 million or 4.7% from the first thirty-nine weeks of
2015. 

Cost of Staffing
Services:  Cost of staffing services was 74.7% and 72.9% of
revenue for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016 and
September 25, 2015, respectively. Part of the increase was due to
the effect of an approximate $700,000 cumulative benefit from the
actuarial adjustment to our prior year s workers 
compensation liability that was recognized during the first
thirty-nine weeks of 2015. There can be fluctuations in the
quarterly workers  compensation expense as a result of
changes to the mix of work performed during the quarter, changes in
our claims history and changes in actuarial assumptions. After
adjusting for this one-time benefit, cost of staffing services for
the thirty-nine weeks ended September 25, 2015 would have been
74.0% instead of 72.9%. Using the adjusted 74.0% cost of staffing
services as a comparison, the 0.7% increase in 2016 was due to the
reduction in higher margin revenue from the North Dakota region as
well as overall higher cost of staffing services in the remaining
branches compared to this same thirty-nine week period last
year. 

14 

Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses ( SG A ):  SG A
expenses were 23.4% and 23.1% of revenue for the thirty-nine weeks
ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015, respectively. On
an absolute basis our SG A expense was approximately $337,000
or 2.2% higher in the first thirty-nine weeks of 2016 than in the
same period in 2015. This increase year over year was due to
$148,000 of payroll tax expense, $98,000 payroll tax penalties,
$276,000 workers  compensation expense, $265,000 contract
labor and consulting expense for special projects and as a
substitute for hiring full-time resources, and $114,000 credit card
fees from increased credit card payments by customers, offset by
$162,000 decrease in salaries due to a reduction in sales training
staff, $224,000 reduction in stock based compensation, and $267,000
reduction in legal services. 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources 

Cash
used by operating activities totaled approximately $2.8 million
during the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016, as compared
to cash provided by operating activities of $1.3 million for the
same thirty-nine week period in 2015. The significant changes in
cash used by or provided by operating activities include the net
income for the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016 of
approximately $578,000 compared to net income of $1,432,000 for the
prior year. Accounts receivable increased approximately $3.0
million during the thirty-nine week period ended September 23, 2016
compared to a $1.1 million increase in 2015. 

Cash
used in investing activities totaled approximately $2.1 million for
the thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016 compared to $212,000
in 2015. In June, 2016, we acquired the assets of Hanwood Oklahoma,
LLC and Hanwood Arkansas, LLC, operating branches in Oklahoma City,
Oklahoma and Little Rock, Arkansas, respectively (collectively
referred to as  Hancock .) We paid $1.98 million in
cash for the assets. The purchase resulted in a $1.2 million
increase in goodwill and an approximately $586,000 increase in
intangible assets. 

Cash
used by financing activities totaled approximately $2.3 million and
$3.9 million during the first thirty-nine weeks of 2016 and
2015.   In April 2015
the Board of Directors authorized a $5.0 million three-year program
for repurchase of our common stock. During the first thirty-nine
weeks of 2016 and 2015 we purchased 3,402,383 and 1,889,310 shares,
respectively, of common stock at an aggregate price of
approximately $1,382,000 and
$1,146,000, respectively, resulting in an average price of
$0.41and
$0.61, respectively per share. These shares were then retired. We
have approximately $2.2
million remaining under the plan. 

The
Company believes its cash flow from operations plus the
availability from its account purchase agreement facility provide
adequate liquidity to operate over the next twelve
months. 

Accounts
Receivable:  At September 23, 2016 we had total current
assets of approximately $15.2 million. Included in current assets
are trade accounts receivable of approximately $12.4 million (net
of allowance for bad debts of approximately $795,000). Weighted
average aging on our trade accounts receivable at September 23,
2016 was 44 days compared to 37 days at September 25, 2015.
 Bad debt expense was approximately $409,000 for the
thirty-nine weeks ended September 23, 2016 compared to
approximately $322,000 during the same time period ended September
25, 2015. 

Financing:   In May 2016, we
signed a new Account Purchase Agreement with our lender, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A. The agreement allows us to sell eligible accounts
receivable for 90% of the invoiced amount on a full recourse basis
up to the facility maximum, $14 million. When the receivable is
collected, the remaining 10% is paid to us, less applicable fees
and interest. At September 23, 2016 there were approximately $8.3
million in outstanding accounts receivable sold under this
agreement. The term of the agreement is through April 2018. The
agreement bears interest at the Daily One Month London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 2.5% per annum. At September 23, 2016,
the effective interest rate was 3.01%. Interest is payable on the
actual amount advanced. Additional charges include an annual
facility fee equal to 0.50% of the facility threshold in place and
lockbox fees. As collateral for repayment of any and all
obligations, we granted Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. a security interest
in all of our property including, but not limited to, accounts
receivable, intangible assets, contract rights, investment
property, deposit accounts, and other such assets. 

15 

We also
have an outstanding letter of credit under this agreement in the
amount of $5.7 million which reduces the amount of funds otherwise
made available to us under this agreement. 

Workers 
Compensation:  Our workers  compensation carrier is
Chubb Corp. ( Chubb ) in all states in which we operate
other than Washington and North Dakota. (See  Note 5: Workers  Compensation Insurance
Reserve  for disclosure about Chubb as our carrier after it
was acquired by ACE American Insurance company.) The Chubb
insurance policy is a large deductible policy where we have primary
responsibility for all claims made. Chubb provides insurance for
covered losses and expenses in excess of $500,000 per incident.
Under this high deductible policy, we are largely self-insured. Per
our contractual agreements with Chubb, we must provide a collateral
deposit of $5.7 million, which is accomplished through a letter of
credit under our account purchase agreement. 

I tem 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

There is no
established market for trading our common stock. The market for our
common stock is limited, and as such, shareholders may have
difficulty reselling their shares when desired or at attractive
market prices. The common stock is not regularly quoted in the
automated quotation system of a registered securities system or
association. Our common stock, par value $0.001 per share, is
quoted on the OTC Markets Group QB (OTCQB) under the symbol
 CCNI . The OTCQB is a network of security dealers who
buy and sell stock. The dealers are connected by a computer network
which provides information on current  bids  and
 asks  as well as volume information. The OTCQB is not
considered a  national exchange . The
 over-the-counter  quotations do not reflect
inter-dealer prices, retail mark-ups, commissions or actual
transactions. Our common stock has continued to trade in low
volumes and at low prices. Some investors view low-priced stocks as
unduly speculative and therefore not appropriate candidates for
investment. Many institutional investors have internal policies
prohibiting the purchase or maintenance of positions in low-priced
stocks. 

I tem 4. Controls and Procedures 

Under the
supervision and with the participation of our management, including
our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period
covered by this report and, based on this evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded
that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective. There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the period covered by
this report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely
to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

I,
Frederick Sandford, President and Chief Executive Officer, certify
that: 

1. 

I have
reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Command Center,
Inc. 

2. 

Based
on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact nor omit to state a material fact necessary to
make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which
such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the
period covered by this quarterly report; 

3. 

Based
on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial
information included in this quarterly report, fairly present in
all material respects the financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the
periods presented in this quarterly report; 

4. 

The
registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for
establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 (e) and 15d-15(e)) for the
registrant and we have: 

a)   

Designed such
disclosure controls and procedures or caused such disclosure
controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to
ensure that material information relating to the registrant is made
known to us by others within those entities, particularly during
the period in which this report is being prepared. 

b)   

Designed such
internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal
control over financial reporting to be designed under our
supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. 

c)   

Evaluated the
effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and
procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the
effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the
end of the period covered by this report based on such
evaluation. 

d)   

Disclosed in this
report any change in the registrant's internal control over
financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most
recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's second fiscal quarter in
the case of this quarterly report) that has materially affected, or
is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's
internal control over financial reporting. 

5. 

The
registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based
on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial
reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of
the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the
equivalent functions): 

a)   

All
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or
operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial
information. 

b)   

Any
fraud, whether material or not, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal
control over financial reporting.
