NOTE     A           BASIS OF PRESENTATION     AND     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  We are a provider of compression services and equipment for natural gas and oil production, gathering, transportation, processing, and storage. We sell standard and custom-designed compressor packages and oilfield fluid pump systems, and provide aftermarket services and compressor package parts and components manufactured by third-party suppliers. We provide these compression services and equipment to a broad base of natural gas and oil exploration and production, midstream, and transmission companies operating throughout many of the onshore producing regions of the United States as well as in a number of foreign countries, including Mexico, Canada, and Argentina. We design and fabricate a majority of the compressor packages that we use to provide compression services and that we sell to customers.  
  Presentation 
    
  Our unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of our management, our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of   September 30, 2016  , and for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , include all normal recurring adjustments that are necessary to provide a fair statement of our results for these interim periods. Operating results for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the twelve months ended   December 31, 2016  . 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X for interim financial statements required to be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and do not include all information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. These financial statements should be read in connection with the financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A, which     we filed with the SEC on   March 11, 2016  . 
    
  Throughout 2015 and continuing into 2016, low oil and natural gas commodity prices lowered the capital expenditure and operating plans of many of our customers, creating uncertainty regarding the expected demand and pricing levels for many of our products and services and the resulting cash flows from operating activities for the foreseeable future. In addition, the availability of new borrowings in current capital markets is limited and costly. Accordingly, we have implemented, and continue to implement, cost reduction measures designed to lower our cost structure and improve our operating cash flows. These measures include headcount and salary reductions. We also continue to negotiate with our suppliers and service providers to reduce costs. We continue to critically review all capital expenditure activities and are deferring a significant portion of our growth capital expenditure plans until they may be justified in the future by expected activity levels. In May and November 2016, we amended the agreement governing our revolving bank credit facility (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") by, among other things, favorably adjusting the consolidated total leverage ratio, the consolidated secured leverage ratio, and the consolidated interest coverage ratio. In   August 2016   and   September 2016  , we received a total of   $77.3 million   of aggregate net proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, from private placements of Series A Convertible Preferred Units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the "Preferred Units") and such net proceeds were used to pay additional offering expenses and reduce outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Agreement and our 7.25% Senior Notes. (See Note C - Series A Convertible Preferred Units for further discussion.) We believe the steps taken have enhanced our operating cash flows and liquidity, and additional steps may be taken in the future. We have reviewed our financial forecasts as of   November 9, 2016   for the twelve month period subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , which consider the impact of recent cost reduction efforts, the amendments of our Credit Agreement, and the   $77.3 million   of aggregate net proceeds received from the private placement of Preferred Units. Based on this review and the current market conditions as of   November 9, 2016  , we believe that despite the current industry environment and activity levels, we will have adequate liquidity, earnings, and operating cash flows to fund our operations and debt obligations and maintain compliance with debt covenants through September 30, 2017.

Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclose contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, and impairments during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and such differences could be     material. 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain previously reported financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current year period s presentation. The impact of such reclassifications was not significant to the prior year period s overall presentation. These reclassifications include the presentation of deferred financing costs in accordance with the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-03 and ASU No. 2015-15 as further discussed below and the reclassification of the amortization of deferred financing costs from other expense, net to interest expense, net. Additionally, see Note B - Long-Term Debt and Other Borrowings for further discussion and presentation. 
    
  Beginning with the three month period ended March 31, 2016, Parts Sales revenues and Cost of Parts Sales revenues have been reclassified as part of Aftermarket Services revenues and Cost of Aftermarket Services revenues, respectively, instead of being included with Equipment Sales revenues and Cost of Equipment Sales revenues as reported in prior periods. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year period's presentation. The amounts for Parts Sales revenue are   $4.7 million   and   $14.5 million   for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $4.7 million   and   $13.9 million   for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The amounts for Cost of Parts Sales revenue are   $2.8 million   and   $10.0 million   for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $3.8 million   and   $10.5 million   for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Cash Equivalents 
    
  We consider all highly     liquid cash investments with     maturities     of three months or less when purchased     to be cash equivalents. 
    
  Foreign Currencies 
    
  We have designated the Canadian dollar and Argentine peso as the functional currencies for our operations in Canada and Argentina, respectively. We are exposed to fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and certain foreign currencies, including the Canadian dollar, the Mexican peso, and the Argentine peso, as a result of our international operations. Foreign currency exchange gains and (losses) are included in other expense and totaled   $(0.4) million   and   $(1.2) million   during the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016     respectively, and   $(1.0) million   and   $(1.8) million   during the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Inventories 
    
  Inventories     consist primarily of compressor package parts and supplies and work in progress and are stated at the lower of cost or     market value. For parts and supplies, cost is determined using the weighted average     cost     method. The cost of work in progress is determined using the specific identification method. Work in progress inventories consist primarily of new compressor packages located at our fabrication facility in Midland, Texas. Components of inventories as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , are as follows:  

7 

During the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $12.0 million   of work in progress inventory was transferred to Property, Plant and Equipment. We write down the value of inventory by an amount equal to the difference between its cost and its estimated market value. 
    
  Compression and Related Services Revenues and Costs 
    
  Our compression and related services revenues include revenues from our U.S. corporate subsidiaries' operating lease agreements with customers. For the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the following operating lease revenues and associated costs were included in compression and related service revenues and cost of compression and related services, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As a result of our customers entering into compression service contracts, our revenues from rental contracts have   decreased   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding prior year periods. 

Earnings     Per Common Unit 
    
  Our computations of     earnings     per common unit are based on the weighted average number of common units outstanding during the applicable period. Basic     earnings     per common unit     are     determined by dividing net income (loss) allocated to the common units after deducting the amount allocated to our     General Partner     (including any distributions to our     General Partner     on its incentive distribution rights), by the weighted average number of     outstanding common units during the period. 
    
  When computing     earnings     per common unit when distributions are greater than earnings, the amount of the distribution is deducted from net income and the excess of distributions over earnings is allocated between the     General Partner and common units based on how our Partnership Agreement allocates net losses. 
    
  When earnings are greater than distributions, we determine cash distributions based on available cash and determine the actual incentive distributions allocable to our General Partner based on actual distributions. When computing earnings per common unit, the amount of the assumed incentive distribution rights, if any, is deducted from net income and allocated to our General Partner for the period to which the calculation relates. The remaining amount of net income, after deducting the assumed incentive distribution rights, is allocated between the General Partner and common units based on how our Partnership Agreement allocates net earnings. 
    
  Diluted earnings per common unit are computed using the treasury stock method, which considers the potential future issuance of limited partner common units. Unvested phantom units are not included in basic earnings per common unit, as they are not considered to be participating securities, but are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per common unit. For the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , all incremental unvested phantom units were excluded from the calculation of diluted common units because the impact was anti-dilutive. Following the issuance of the Preferred Units, diluted earnings per common unit are computed using the "if converted" method, whereby the amount of net income (loss) and the number of common units issuable are each adjusted as if the Preferred Units had been converted as of the date of issuance. The number of common units that may be issued upon future conversion of the Preferred Units is excluded from the calculation of diluted common units, as the impact would be antidilutive due to the net loss recorded during the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired in purchase transactions. We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment are present. We perform the annual test of goodwill impairment following the fourth quarter of each year. The assessment for goodwill impairment begins with a qualitative assessment of whether it is  more likely than  
  
   8 

not  that the fair value of our business is less than its carrying value. This qualitative assessment requires the evaluation, based on the weight of evidence, of the significance of all identified events and circumstances. During   2015  , and continuing into   2016  , global oil and natural gas commodity prices, particularly crude oil, were significantly reduced. These low commodity prices have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative impact on industry drilling and capital expenditure activity, which affects the demand for a portion of our products and services. The accompanying decrease in the price of our common units during the last half of 2015 and early   2016   also resulted in an overall reduction in our market capitalization. Based on this qualitative assessment, we determined that, due to the decline in the price of our common units that resulted in our market capitalization being less than the book value of our consolidated partners' capital balance as of March 31, 2016, it was  more likely than not  that the fair value of our business was less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016.  
    
  When the qualitative analysis indicates that it is  more likely than not  that our business  fair value is less than its carrying value, the resulting goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step accounting test being performed. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the estimated fair value with the recorded net book value (including goodwill) of our business. If the estimated fair value is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required. If, however, the estimated fair value is below the recorded net book value, then a second step must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required, if any. In this second step, the estimated fair value from the first step is used as the purchase price in a hypothetical acquisition. Business combination accounting rules are followed to determine a hypothetical purchase price allocation to assets and liabilities. The residual amount of goodwill that results from this hypothetical purchase price allocation is compared to the recorded amount of goodwill and the recorded amount is written down to the hypothetical amount, if lower.  
    
  Our management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test. Management uses all available information to make these fair value determinations, including the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets. The resultant fair values calculated are then compared to observable metrics for other companies in our industry or on mergers and acquisitions in our industry, to determine whether those valuations, in our judgment, appear reasonable.  
    
  The accounting principles regarding goodwill acknowledge that the observed market prices of individual trades of a company s stock (and thus its computed market capitalization) may not be representative of the fair value of the company as a whole. Substantial value may arise from the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that flow from control over another entity. Consequently, measuring the fair value of a collection of assets and liabilities that operate together in a controlled entity is different from measuring the fair value of a single share of that entity s common stock. Therefore, once the fair value of the reporting units was determined, we also added a control premium to the calculations. This control premium is judgmental and is based on observed mergers and acquisitions in our industry. 
    
  Goodwill Impairment as of March 31, 2016  . As part of our annual internal business outlook that we performed during the fourth quarter of 2015, we considered changes in the global economic environment which affected our common unit price and market capitalization. As part of the first step of goodwill impairment testing as of March 31, 2016, we updated our annual assessment of our future cash flows, applying expected long-term growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values that we consider reasonable. We calculated a present value of the cash flows to arrive at an estimate of fair value under the income approach, and then used the market approach to corroborate this value.  
    
  During the first three months of   2016  , low oil and natural gas commodity prices resulted in decreased demand for certain of our products and services. Specifically, demand for low-horsepower wellhead compression services and for sales of compressor equipment decreased significantly and is expected to continue to be decreased for the foreseeable future. In addition, the price per common unit as of March 31, 2016 decreased compared to December 31, 2015. Accordingly, the fair value, as reflected by our market capitalization and other indicators, was less than our carrying value as of March 31, 2016. After making the hypothetical purchase price adjustments as part of the second step of the goodwill impairment test, there was   $0.0 million   residual purchase price to be allocated to our goodwill. Based on this analysis, we concluded that an impairment of all of our recorded goodwill was required. Accordingly, during the three month period ended March 31, 2016,   $92.4 million   was charged to Goodwill Impairment expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations.  

9 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the carrying amount of goodwill is   $0.0 million  , after giving effect to the   $233.5 million   of accumulated impairment losses.       
       
  The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows: 

Impairments of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  Impairments of long-lived assets, including identified intangible assets, are determined periodically, when indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future undiscounted operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their remaining estimated useful lives. If these undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the related asset, an impairment is recognized for the excess of the carrying value over its fair value. Fair value of intangible assets is generally determined using the discounted present value of future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks inherent with the specific assets. Assets held for disposal are recorded at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less estimated selling costs. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, as a result of continuing decreased demand as a result of current market conditions, we recorded impairments of   $7.9 million   associated with certain identified intangible assets. This amount was charged to Long-Lived Asset Impairment expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. 
    
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
    
  Certain of     our international operations maintain their accounting records in the local currencies that are their functional currencies. For these operations, the functional currency financial statements are converted to United States dollar equivalents, with the effect of the foreign currency translation adjustment reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is included in partners  capital in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and consists of the cumulative currency translation adjustments associated with such international operations. Activity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) during the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,     is as follows: 

Activity within accumulated other comprehensive income includes no     reclassifications to net income. 
    
  Allocation of Net Income (Loss) 
    
  Our net income (loss) is allocated to partners  capital accounts in accordance with the provisions of our partnership agreement. 
    
  Distributions 
    
    On   January 22, 2016  , our General Partner declared a cash distribution attributable to the quarter ended December 31, 2015 of   $0.3775   per common unit. This distribution equates to a distribution of   $1.51   per outstanding  
  
   10 

common unit on an annualized basis. This cash distribution was paid on   February 15, 2016  , to all common unitholders of record as of the close of business on   February 1, 2016  . 
       
  On   April 19, 2016  , our General Partner declared a cash distribution attributable to the quarter ended March 31, 2016 of   $0.3775   per common unit. This distribution equates to a distribution of   $1.51   per outstanding common unit on an annualized basis. This cash distribution was paid on   May 13, 2016   to all common unitholders of record as of the close of business on   April 29, 2016  . 
    
  On   July 22, 2016  , our General Partner declared a cash distribution attributable to the quarter ended June 30, 2016 of   $0.3775   per common unit. This distribution equates to a distribution of   $1.51   per outstanding common unit on an annualized basis. This cash distribution was paid on   August 15, 2016   to all common unitholders of record as of the close of business on   August 1, 2016  . 
    
  On   October 21, 2016  , our General Partner declared a cash distribution attributable to the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of   $0.3775   per common unit. This distribution equates to a distribution of   $1.51   per outstanding common unit on an annualized basis. Also on   October 21, 2016  , our General Partner approved the paid-in-kind distribution of   77,149   Preferred Units attributable to the portion of the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   for which the Preferred Units were outstanding, in accordance with the provisions of our partnership agreement, as amended. These distributions will be paid on   November 14, 2016   to all holders of common units and Preferred Units, respectively, of record as of the close of business on   November 1, 2016  . 
    
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  Fair value is defined as  the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  within an entity s principal market, if any. The principal market is the market in which the reporting entity would sell the asset or transfer the liability with the greatest volume and level of activity, regardless of whether it is the market in which the entity will ultimately transact for a particular asset or liability or if a different market is potentially more advantageous. Accordingly, this exit price concept may result in a fair value that may differ from the transaction price or market price of the asset or liability. 
    
  Under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), the fair value hierarchy prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Fair value measurements should maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs, where possible. Observable inputs are developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs may be needed to measure fair value in situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which could include the reporting entity s own judgments about the assumptions market participants would utilize in pricing the asset or liability. 
  We utilize fair value measurements to account for certain items and account balances within our consolidated financial statements. Fair value measurements are utilized in the determination of the carrying value of our Preferred Units (a Level 3 fair value measurement), which were issued in August and September 2016. We also utilize fair value measurements on a recurring basis in the accounting for our foreign currency forward purchase and sale derivative contracts. For these fair value measurements, we utilize the quoted value as determined by our counterparty financial institution (a level 2 fair value measurement). Fair value measurements are also utilized on a nonrecurring basis, such as in the allocation of purchase consideration for acquisition transactions to the assets and liabilities acquired, including intangible assets and goodwill (a Level 3 fair value measurement), and for the impairment of long-lived assets, including goodwill (a level 3 fair value measurement). The fair value of certain of our financial instruments, which may include cash, accounts receivable, short-term borrowings, and variable-rate long-term debt pursuant to our bank credit agreement, approximate their carrying amounts. The fair values of our publicly traded long-term 7.25% Senior Notes at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were approximately   $312.7 million   and   $259.9 million  , respectively, based on current interest rates on     those dates which were different from the stated interest rate on the 7.25% Senior Notes (a level 2 fair value measurement). Those fair values compared to aggregate principal amounts of such notes at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   of   $330.0 million   and   $350.0 million  , respectively.  
    
    The Preferred Units are valued using a lattice modeling technique that, among a number of lattice structures, includes significant unobservable items. These unobservable items include (i) the volatility of the trading  
  
   11 

price of our common units compared to a volatility analysis of equity prices of comparable peer companies, (ii) a yield analysis that utilizes market information related to the debt yields of comparable peer companies, and (iii) a future conversion price analysis. The fair valuation of our Preferred Units liability is increased by, among other factors, projected increases in our common unit price, and by increases in the volatility and decreases in the debt yields of comparable peer companies. Increases (or decreases) in the fair value of our Preferred Units will increase (decrease) the associated liability and result in future adjustments to earnings for the associated valuation losses (gains). 
  A summary of these recurring fair value measurements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is as follows:

During the first quarter of   2016  , we recorded total impairment charges of   $100.2 million  , reflecting the decreased fair value for certain assets. Assets that were partially impaired included certain of our intangible assets. The fair values used in these impairment calculations were estimated based on discounted estimated future cash flows, based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) in accordance with the fair value hierarchy.

New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
         In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers." ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605, Revenue Recognition, and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, under either full or modified retrospective adoption. We are currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)" to clarify the guidance on principal versus agent considerations. This ASU does not change the effective date or adoption method under ASU 2014-09 which is noted above.  
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing" to clarify the guidance on identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. This ASU does not change the effective date or adoption method under ASU 2014-09, which is noted above. 
    
  Additionally in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients". This ASU addresses and amends several aspects of ASU 2014-09, but does not change the core principle of the guidance. This ASU does not change the effective date or adoption method under ASU 2014-09 which is noted above. 
    
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern . The ASU provides guidance on management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and in certain circumstances to provide related footnote disclosures. The ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual and interim periods thereafter. Early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . The ASU requires entities that have historically presented debt issuance costs as an asset to present those costs as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability. This presentation will result in the debt issuance costs being presented the same way debt discounts have historically been handled. The ASU does not change the recognition, measurement, or subsequent measurement guidance for debt issuance costs. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods, and is to be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is permitted. As a result of the retrospective adoption of this guidance during the quarter ended March 31, 2016, deferred financing costs of $7.0 million and $8.4 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are netted against the carrying values of the 7.25% Senior Notes.  
  
   13 

Additionally, in accordance with ASU No. 2015-15, "Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements", issued in August 2015, we elected to present the deferred financing costs associated with our Credit Agreement of $4.4 million and $5.4 million at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, as netted against the outstanding amount of the Credit Agreement. 
   In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,  Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory , which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventory by requiring entities to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value, except for inventory measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory methods. The ASU requires entities to compare the cost of inventory to one measure - net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, and is to be applied prospectively with early adoption permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" to increase comparability and transparency among different organizations. Organizations are required to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities in the balance sheet and disclose key information about the leasing arrangements and cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted, under a modified retrospective adoption. We are currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to our consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" as part of a simplification initiative. The update addresses and simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted, and is to be applied using either modified retrospective, retrospective, or prospective transition method based on which amendment is being applied. We are currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to our consolidated financial statements. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments." ASU 2016-13 amends the impairment model to utilize an expected loss methodology in place of the currently used incurred loss methodology, which will result in the more timely recognition of losses. ASU 2016-13, which has an effective date of the first quarter of fiscal 2022, also applies to employee benefit plan accounting. We are currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to our consolidated financial statements and employee benefit plan accounting. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments" to reduce diversity in practice in classification of certain transactions in the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted, under a retrospective transition adoption. We are currently assessing the potential effects of these changes to our consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE B           LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER BORROWINGS 
    
  Long-term debt consists of the following: 
  
   14 

As a result of the retrospective adoption of ASU 2015-03 during the three months ended March 31, 2016, deferred financing costs of   $13.8 million   at   December 31, 2015   were reclassified out of long-term other assets and are netted against the carrying values of our Credit Agreement and 7.25% Senior Notes. As of   September 30, 2016  , long-term debt is presented net of deferred financing costs of   $11.4 million  . In addition,   $0.7 million   and   $2.1 million   for the   three and nine   periods ended   September 30, 2015   were reclassified from Other Expense, net to Interest Expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. As of the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  ,   $0.7 million   and   $2.1 million  , respectively, of financing costs were expensed in interest expense.  
    
    Bank Credit Facilities. 
    
  On May 25, 2016, we entered into an amendment (the "Third Amendment") to our Credit Agreement that modified certain financial covenants in the Credit Agreement. As discussed below, these financial covenants were further amended in November 2016. The Third Amendment provided for other changes related to the Credit Agreement including (i) reducing the maximum aggregate lender commitments from $400.0 million to $340.0 million; (ii) increasing the applicable margin by 0.25% with a range between 2.00% and 3.00% per annum for LIBOR-based loans  and 1.00% to 2.00% per annum for base-rate loans, based on the applicable consolidated total leverage ratio; (iii) imposed a requirement that we use designated consolidated cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of $35.0 million to prepay the loans; (iv) imposed a requirement to deliver on an annual basis, and at such other times as may be required, an appraisal of our compressor equipment; (v) increased the amount of equipment and real property that may be disposed of in any four consecutive fiscal quarters from $5.0 million to $20.0 million; (vi) allow the prepayment or purchase of indebtedness with proceeds from the issuances of equity securities or in exchange for the issuances of equity securities; and (vii) reduced the amount of our permitted capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business during each fiscal year from $150.0 million to an amount generally ranging from $25.0 million in 2016 to $75.0 million in 2019. As a result of the reduction of the maximum lender commitment pursuant to the Third Amendment, unamortized deferred finance costs of   $0.7 million   were charged to interest expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Pursuant to the Third Amendment, bank fees of   $0.7 million   were incurred during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   and were deferred, netting against the carrying value of the amount outstanding under our Credit Agreement.  
    
  On   November 3, 2016  , we entered into an additional amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to our Credit Agreement that, among other changes, further modified certain financial covenants in the Credit Agreement. The Fourth Amendment converted the Credit Agreement from a secured revolving credit facility into an asset-based revolving credit facility ("ABL Facility"). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement, as amended, may not exceed a borrowing base equal to the sum of (i) 80% of the aggregate net amount of our eligible accounts receivable, plus (ii) 20% of the aggregate value of any eligible parts inventory, in the event we elect to include eligible parts inventory pursuant to a notice to the administrative agent, plus (iii) 80% of the net in-place eligible compressor equipment, decreased each month by the amount of associated depreciation expense, plus (iv) 80% of the cost of new eligible  
  
   15 

compressor equipment, and minus (v) the amount of any reserves established by the administrative agent in its discretion. In addition, the Fourth Amendment imposed other requirements, including requirements related to borrowing base reporting on a monthly basis and provisions to permit periodic appraisal and inspection of collateral assets. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, certain additional restrictive provisions ("cash dominion provisions") are imposed if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or excess availability under the ABL Facility falls below $30.0 million. The Fourth Amendment modified certain financial covenants as follows: (i) the consolidated total leverage ratio may not exceed (a) 5.75 to 1 as of September 30, 2016, (b) 5.95 to 1 as of the fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2016 through June 30, 2018; (c) 5.75 to 1 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018; and (d) 5.50 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 and thereafter. (ii) the consolidated secured leverage ratio may not exceed (a) 3.25 to 1 as of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 through June 30, 2018; and (b) 3.50 to 1 as of September 30, 2018 and thereafter; and (iii) the consolidated interest coverage ratio may not fall below (a) 2.25 to 1 as of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 through June 30, 2018; (b) 2.50 to 1 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018; and (c) 2.75 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 and thereafter. In addition, the Fourth Amendment reduced the maximum aggregate lender commitments from $340.0 million to $315.0 million. The Fourth Amendment provides for an increase in the applicable margin by 0.25% in the event the consolidated leverage ratio exceeds 5.50 to 1, resulting in a range for the applicable margin between 2.00% and 3.25% per annum for LIBOR-based loans  and 1.00% to 2.25% per annum for base-rate loans, according to the consolidated total leverage ratio. The Fourth Amendment also amended the negative covenant regarding restricted payments (which includes distributions on our common units) by providing that no restricted payment may be made if, after giving effect to such restricted payment, the excess availability under the ABL Facility would be less than $30.0 million. As a result of the further reduction of the aggregate lender commitments pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, unamortized deferred finance costs of   $0.3 million   will be charged to interest expense during the three months ended December 31, 2016.  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated total leverage ratio was   4.83   to 1 (compared to 5.50 to 1 maximum as then required under the Credit Agreement), our consolidated secured leverage ratio was   1.75   to 1 (compared to 3.50 to 1 maximum as then required under the Credit Agreement) and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was   3.36   to 1 (compared to a 3.0 to 1 minimum as then required under the Credit Agreement).  
    
  The consolidated total leverage ratio and the consolidated secured leverage ratio, as both are calculated under the Credit Agreement, exclude the long-term liability for the Preferred Units in the determination of total indebtedness.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a balance outstanding under our Credit Agreement of   $181.0 million  , and we had   $7.7 million   letters of credit and performance bonds outstanding thereunder, leaving a net availability under the Credit Agreement of   $151.3 million  . Covenants and other provisions in the Credit Agreement may limit our borrowings of amounts available under the Credit Agreement. We are in compliance with all covenants of our debt agreements as of   September 30, 2016  . We have reviewed our financial forecasts as of   November 9, 2016   for the twelve month period subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , which consider the impact of recent cost reduction efforts, the Third and Fourth Amendment of our Credit Agreement, and the   $77.3 million   of aggregate net proceeds received from the Private Placement of Preferred Units. Based on this review and the current market conditions as of   November 9, 2016  , we believe that despite the current industry environment and activity levels, we will have adequate liquidity, earnings, and operating cash flows to fund our operations and debt obligations and maintain compliance with debt covenants through September 30, 2017. 
    
    7.25% Senior Notes 
    
  On August 8, 2016, in connection with the closing of the Private Placement, we entered into a Note Repurchase Agreement (the  Note Repurchase Agreement ) with Hudson Bay Fund LP pursuant to which we agreed to repurchase up to   $20.0 million   of our 7.25% Senior Notes due August 15, 2022 (the  7.25% Senior Notes ). Any repurchase of the 7.25% Senior Notes by us was conditioned on us receiving proceeds from the sale of additional equity securities of the Partnership, including, without limitation, additional Preferred Units or Series A Parity Securities (as defined in the Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement) between August 8, 2016 and October 12, 2016. Additionally, the aggregate repurchase price of 7.25% Senior Notes could not be greater than the proceeds then received by us from the sale of equity described in the preceding sentence. For further discussion of the Preferred Units, see Note C - Series A Convertible Preferred Units.     
    
  In September 2016, we repurchased on the open market and retired   $20.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes for a purchase price of   $18.8 million  , at an average repurchase price of   94%   of the  
  
   16 

principal amount of the 7.25% Senior Notes, plus accrued interest, utilizing a portion of the net proceeds of the sale of the Preferred Units. In connection with the repurchase of these 7.25% Senior Notes,   $0.5 million   of early extinguishment net gain was credited to other expense during the three month period ended September 30, 2016, representing the difference between the repurchase price and the   $20.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the 7.25% Senior Notes repurchased, and   $0.7 million   of remaining unamortized deferred finance costs and discounts associated with the repurchased 7.25% Senior Notes. In October 2016, we repurchased on the open market and retired an additional   $34.1 million   aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes, for a purchase price of   $32.1 million  , at an average repurchase price of   94%   of the principal amount of the 7.25% Senior Notes, plus accrued interest. A portion of the 7.25% Senior Notes repurchased during September and October 2016 was held by Hudson Bay Fund LP, and following the repurchase of these 7.25% Senior Notes from Hudson Bay Fund LP, the above Note Repurchase Agreement was canceled. Following the above repurchase transactions, we have   $295.9 million   in aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% Senior Notes outstanding. 

NOTE C   SERIES A CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED UNITS 
    
  On   August 8, 2016   and   September 20, 2016  , we entered into Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreements (the  Unit Purchase Agreements ) with certain purchasers with regard to our issuance and sale in private placements (the "Initial Private Placement" and "Subsequent Private Placement," respectively) of an aggregate of   6,999,126   Preferred Units for a cash purchase price of   $11.43   per Preferred Unit (the  Issue Price ), resulting in total net proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, of approximately   $77.3 million  . One of the purchasers in the Initial Private Placement was TETRA, which purchased   874,891   of the Preferred Units at the aggregate Issue Price of   $10.0 million  . Proceeds from the Initial Private Placement and Subsequent Private Placement were used to pay additional offering expenses and reduce outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Agreement and our 7.25% Senior Notes.  
    
  In connection with the closing of the Initial Private Placement, our General Partner executed a Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the  Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement ) to, among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the Preferred Units. The Preferred Units are a new class of equity security that will rank senior to all classes or series of equity securities of the Partnership with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. The holders of Preferred Units (each, a  Preferred Unitholder ) will receive quarterly distributions, which will be paid in kind in additional Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of   11.00%   of the Issue Price (or   $1.2573   per Preferred Unit annualized), subject to certain adjustments. The rights of the Preferred Units include certain anti-dilution adjustments, including adjustments for economic dilution resulting from the issuance of common units in the future below a set price. 
    
  A ratable portion of the Preferred Units will be converted into common units on the eighth day of each month over a period of thirty months beginning in March 2017 (each, a  Conversion Date ), subject to certain provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement that may delay or accelerate all or a portion of such monthly conversions. On each Conversion Date, a portion of the Preferred Units will convert into common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership in an amount equal to, with respect to each Preferred Unitholder, the number of Preferred Units held by such Preferred Unitholder divided by the number of Conversion Dates remaining, subject to adjustment described in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, with the conversion price (the "Conversion Price") determined by the trading prices of the common units over the prior month, among other factors, and as otherwise impacted by the existence of certain conditions related to the common units. The maximum aggregate number of common units that could be required to be issued pursuant to the conversion provisions of the Preferred Units is potentially unlimited; however, the Partnership may, at its option, pay cash, or a combination of cash and common units, to the Preferred Unitholders instead of issuing common units on any Conversion Date, subject to certain restrictions as described in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement and the Credit Agreement. 
    
  In addition, each purchaser may convert its Preferred Units, generally on a one-for-one basis and subject to adjustment for certain splits, combinations, reclassifications or other similar transactions and certain anti-dilution adjustments, in whole or in part, at any time following May 31, 2017 so long as any conversion is not for less than $250,000 or such lesser amount, if such conversion relates to all of such purchaser s remaining Preferred Units. The Partnership has the right to be reimbursed for any cash distributions paid with respect to common units issued in any such optional conversion until March 31, 2018. The Preferred Units will vote on an as-converted basis with the common units and will have certain other rights to vote as a class with respect to any amendment to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement that would affect any rights, preferences or privileges of the Preferred Units, as more fully described in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement. 
  
   17 

Because the Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of common units, the fair value of the Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480 "Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity." The fair value of the Preferred Units as of   September 30, 2016   was   $88.1 million  . Changes in the fair value during each quarterly period, including the   $7.2 million   increase in fair value during the third quarter of 2016 subsequent to the issuance of the Preferred Units, are charged to other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Based on the conversion provisions of the Preferred Units, and using the Conversion Price calculated as of   September 30, 2016  , the theoretical number of common units that would be issued if all of the Preferred Units were settled as of   September 30, 2016   would be approximately   8.1 million   common units, with an aggregate market value of   $86.1 million  . A $1 decrease in the average trading price per common unit would result in the issuance of approximately   0.8 million   additional common units pursuant to these conversion provisions.  
    
  In addition, the Unit Purchase Agreements include certain provisions regarding change of control, transfer of Preferred Units, indemnities, and other matters described in detail in the respective Unit Purchase Agreement. In connection with the closings of the Initial and Subsequent Private Placement, we paid total transaction fees of   $2.1 million   to our financial advisors for these transactions. These transaction fees were charged to other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The Unit Purchase Agreements contain customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Partnership and the purchasers.  
    
  Registration Rights Agreement.   On   August 8, 2016   and   September 20, 2016  , in connection with the closings of the Preferred Units, we entered into Registration Rights Agreements (collectively, the  Registration Rights Agreement ) with the purchasers relating to the registered resale of the common units issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Units, including any Preferred Units issued in kind pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we are required to file or cause to be filed a registration statement for such registered resale at our expense no later than 90 days after the closing of the Private Placement, and are required to cause the registration statement to become effective no later than 180 days after the August 8, 2016 closing, subject to certain liquidated damages set forth in the Registration Rights Agreement if such obligations are not met. Pursuant to the requirements under the Registration Rights Agreement, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 4, 2016. 

NOTE D   MARKET RISKS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS 
    
  We are exposed to financial and market risks that affect our businesses. We have currency exchange rate risk exposure related to transactions denominated in a foreign currency as well as to investments in certain of our international operations. As a result of our variable rate bank credit facility, we face market risk exposure related to changes in applicable interest rates. We have concentrations of credit risk as a result of trade receivables owed to us by companies in the energy industry. Our financial risk management activities may at times involve, among other measures, the use of derivative financial instruments, such as swap and collar     agreements, to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures.  
    
  Foreign Currency Derivative Contracts 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the following foreign currency derivative contracts outstanding relating to a portion of our foreign operations: 

Under a program designed to mitigate the currency exchange rate risk exposure on selected transactions of certain foreign subsidiaries, we may enter into similar derivative contracts from time to time. Although contracts pursuant to this program will serve as economic hedges of the cash flow of our currency exchange risk exposure, they will not be formally designated as hedge contracts or qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, any change in the fair value of these derivative instruments during a period will be included in the determination of earnings for that period.

The fair values of our foreign currency derivative instruments are based on quoted market values as reported to us by our counterparty (a Level 2 fair value measurement). The fair values of our foreign currency derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are as follows:

None of the foreign currency derivative contracts contains credit risk related contingent features that would require us to post assets or collateral for contracts that are classified as liabilities. During the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million  , respectively, of net gains associated with our foreign currency derivative program, and such amounts are included in other expense, net, in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. During the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $0.2 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively, of net gains in other expense, net, associated with our foreign currency derivative program. 

NOTE E   RELATED     PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  Omnibus Agreement 
    
       Under the terms of the Omnibus Agreement entered into on June 20, 2011, and later amended June 20, 2014 (the "Omnibus Agreement"),     our     General     Partner     provides     all personnel and services reasonably necessary to manage     our     operations and conduct     our     business     (other than in Mexico, Canada, and Argentina),     and     certain of     TETRA s     Latin American-based subsidiaries provide personnel and services necessary     for the     conduct     of certain of     our     Latin American-based businesses. In addition, under the Omnibus Agreement,     TETRA     provides     certain corporate and general and administrative services     as requested by our     General     Partner,     including, without limitation, legal, accounting and financial reporting, treasury, insurance administration, claims processing and risk management, health, safety and environmental,     information technology, human resources, credit, payroll, internal audit,     and tax services. Pursuant to the Omnibus Agreement,     we     reimburse     our     General     Partner     and     TETRA     for services they provide to     us. The Omnibus Agreement will terminate on the earlier of (i) a change of control of the General Partner or TETRA, or (ii) upon any party providing at least 180 days prior written notice of termination. 
    
  Under     the terms of the Omnibus Agreement,     we     or     TETRA     may, but neither of us     are under any     obligation to, perform for the other such production enhancement or other oilfield services on a subcontract basis as are needed or desired by the     other, for such periods of time and in such amounts as may be mutually agreed upon by     TETRA     and     our     General Partner. Any such services are required to be performed on terms that are (i) approved by the conflicts committee of     our     General Partner s board of directors, (ii) no less favorable to     us     than those generally being provided to or available from non-affiliated third parties, as determined by     our     General Partner, or (iii) fair and reasonable to     us, taking into account the totality of the relationships between     TETRA     and     us     (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to     us), as determined by     our     General Partner. 
    
  Under the terms of the Omnibus Agreement,     we     or     TETRA     may, but neither of us     are under any obligation     to, sell, lease or exchange on a like-kind basis to     the other such production enhancement or other oilfield services equipment as is needed or desired     to meet either of our     production enhancement or other oilfield services obligations, in such amounts, upon     such conditions and for such periods of time, if     applicable, as may be mutually agreed upon by     TETRA     and     our     General Partner. Any such sales, leases,     or like-kind exchanges are required to be on terms that are (i) approved by the conflicts committee of     our     General Partner s board of directors, (ii) no less favorable to     us     than those generally being provided to or available from non-affiliated third parties, as determined by     our     General Partner, or (iii) fair and reasonable to     us, taking into account the totality of the relationships between     TETRA     and     us     (including other transactions that may be particularly favorable or advantageous to     us), as determined by     our     General Partner. In addition, unless otherwise approved by the conflicts committee of     our     General Partner s     board of directors,     TETRA     may purchase     newly fabricated equipment from     us at a negotiated price, provided that such price may not be     less than the sum of the total costs (other than any allocations of general and administrative expenses) incurred by     us     in fabricating such equipment plus a fixed     margin percentage thereof,  
  
   19 

and     TETRA     may purchase from     us     previously fabricated equipment for a price that is not less than the sum of the net book value of such equipment plus a fixed margin percentage thereof. 
    
  This description is not a complete discussion of this agreement and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the complete agreement, which is filed, along with other agreements, as exhibits to our filings with the SEC. 
    
  Amendment to Partnership Agreement 
    
  On and effective as of August 8, 2016, in connection with the closing of the Initial Private Placement of the Preferred Units, our General Partner executed the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement to, among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the Preferred Units. For discussion of the   August 2016   issuance of the Preferred Units, see Note C - Series A Convertible Preferred Units. 
    
  TETRA and General Partner Ownership 
    
  As of     September 30, 2016  , TETRA's ownership interest in us was approximately   44%  , with the common units held by the public representing an approximate   56%   interest in us. For discussion of the purchase by TETRA of a portion of the Preferred Units, see Note C - Series A Convertible Preferred Units. Following the Initial Private Placement and Subsequent Private Placement of the Preferred Units, TETRA's ownership consists of approximately   42%   of the outstanding common units,   12.5%   of the outstanding Preferred Units, and an approximately   2%   general partner interest, through which it holds incentive distribution rights. As Preferred Units are converted to common units, it is expected that TETRA's percentage ownership of the common units will decrease. 

NOTE F   INCOME TAXES 
    
  As a partnership, we are generally not subject to income taxes at the entity level because our income is included in the tax returns of our partners. Our operations are treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes with each partner being separately taxed on its share of taxable income. However, a portion of our business is conducted through taxable U.S. corporate subsidiaries. Accordingly, a U.S. federal and state income tax provision has been reflected in the accompanying statements of operations. Certain of our operations are located outside of the U.S., and the Partnership, through its foreign subsidiaries, is responsible for income taxes in these countries.  
    
  Despite the significant pre-tax losses for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a provision for income tax, primarily attributable to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and Texas gross margin taxes. Our effective tax rates for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   were negative   1.3%   and negative   1.2%  , respectively, primarily due to losses generated in entities for which no related tax benefit has been recorded. The losses generated by these entities do not result in tax benefits due to offsetting valuation allowances being recorded against their net deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in our deferred tax assets are net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are available to offset future income tax liabilities in the U.S. as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions. Further, the effective tax rate is negatively impacted by the nondeductible portion of our goodwill impairments during the three months period ended March 31, 2016.  

NOTE G   COMMITMENTS     AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  From time to time, we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business. While the outcome of any lawsuits     or other proceedings     against us cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not     consider it reasonably possible that a loss resulting from such lawsuits or proceedings in excess of any amounts accrued has been incurred that is     expected     to     have a material adverse effect on our financial     condition, results of operations,     or cash flows.  

20 

NOTE H   SEGMENTS 
    
    ASC 280-10-50,  Operating Segments , defines the characteristics of an operating segment as (i) being engaged in business activity from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, (ii) being reviewed by the company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") to make decisions about resources to be allocated and to assess its performance, and (iii) having discrete financial information. Although management of our General Partner reviews our products and services to analyze the nature of our revenue, other financial information, such as certain costs and expenses, and net income are not captured or analyzed by these items. Therefore discrete financial information is not available by product line and our CODM does not make resource allocation decisions or assess the performance of the business based on these items, but rather in the aggregate. Based on this, our General Partner believes that we operate in one business segment.

NOTE J   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
    
  On   October 21, 2016  , our General Partner declared a cash distribution attributable to the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of   $0.3775   per common unit. This distribution equates to a distribution of   $1.51   per outstanding common unit, on an annualized basis. Also on   October 21, 2016  , our General Partner approved the paid-in-kind distribution of   77,149   Preferred Units attributable to the portion of the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   for which the Preferred Units were outstanding, in accordance with the provisions of our partnership agreement, as amended. These distributions are to be paid on   November 14, 2016   to all holders of common units, and Preferred Units, respectively, of record as of the close of business on   November 1, 2016  .

Item     2.     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition     and Results of Operations. 
    
  The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report.     In addition, the following discussion and analysis also should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC     on   March 11, 2016  . This     discussion includes forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. 

Business Overview 
       
    During the third quarter of 2016 and continuing into November 2016 we have taken additional steps to further enhance our balance sheet and liquidity. In August and September 2016 we completed two private placements of our Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the "Preferred Units") for aggregate net proceeds of   $77.3 million  . The holders of the Preferred Units (each, a  Preferred Unitholder ) will receive quarterly distributions, which will be paid in kind in additional Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of 11.00% of the $11.43 Issue Price, subject to certain adjustments. A ratable portion of the Preferred Units will be converted into common units each month over a period of thirty months beginning in March 2017 (each, a  Conversion Date ), subject to certain provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement that may delay or accelerate all or a portion of such monthly conversions. (For further discussion of the Preferred Units, see   Cash Flows - Financing Activities     section below.) In September 2016, we repurchased on the open market and retired   $20.0 million   aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% Senior Notes due August 15, 2022 (the  7.25% Senior Notes ) for a purchase price of   $18.8 million  , at an average repurchase price of   94%   of the principal amount of such 7.25% Senior Notes, plus accrued interest, utilizing a portion of the net proceeds of the sales of the Preferred Units. In October 2016, we repurchased on the open market and retired an additional   $34.1 million   aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes, plus accrued interest. In addition, on   November 3, 2016  , we entered into an amendment (the "Fourth Amendment") to the agreement governing our revolving bank credit facility (as amended, the "Credit Agreement") that, among other things, converted our bank credit facility to an asset-based lending facility and favorably adjusted the consolidated total leverage ratio and the consolidated minimum interest coverage ratio covenant. We are in compliance with all covenants of our Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . Each of the steps noted above is expected to enhance our liquidity position and improve our ability to maintain compliance with Credit Agreement covenants in the event current market conditions persist. The scheduled maturities of our long-term debt are August 2019 for our Credit Agreement and August 2022 for the remaining 7.25% Senior Notes.  
  As the challenges from the ongoing decreased demand for compression equipment and services persist, we continue to take aggressive actions to reduce costs and improve our balance sheet. While we have seen improvement in the price of oil and natural gas over the past few months, demand for production enhancement compression services continues to be decreased compared to the prior year period for each horsepower (HP) class of our compressor fleet, and has particularly affected demand for our below-100 HP compression services. Demand for high-horsepower and medium-horsepower compression services has also been impacted by the current oil and natural gas pricing, but to a lesser extent. As a result, total horsepower utilization rate as of   September 30, 2016   has declined to   75.2%   compared to   81.9%   as of   September 30, 2015  , (and compared to 75.8% as of June 30, 2016) and this decrease in utilization, along with increasing downward pressure on compression services pricing, is reflected in a   27.0%   decrease in compression and related services revenue during the   third   quarter of 2016 compared to the prior year quarter. Continued pricing pressure is expected going forward, based on current reduced overall compression industry utilization rates. In addition, the current reduced capital expenditure levels for compression projects of our customers have adversely impacted demand for our new compressor packages, resulting in a decrease in equipment sales revenues of   79.0%   during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the corresponding prior year quarter. Our fabrication backlog associated with new equipment sales decreased significantly throughout 2015 and has continued to decrease during   2016  , to   $20.8 million   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $33.6 million   and   $46.1 million   as of   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Much of this equipment sales fabrication backlog is associated with customer gas gathering and pump projects. Demand for our products and services is expected to continue to be decreased for the foreseeable future and, as a result, our future revenues and operating cash flows are expected to be adversely impacted. 
  In response to the current market environment, in addition to the steps described above to improve our balance sheet and liquidity, we continue to aggressively reduce operating and administrative costs and curtail our fleet growth capital expenditures. In addition to headcount and salary reductions, which have reduced operating and administrative expense levels, our capital expenditures, net of disposals and proceeds, during the first   nine   months of 2016 were   $7.6 million   compared to   $76.0 million   during the corresponding prior year period.  
  
   30 

We expect that oil and gas spending and activity levels will continue to be depressed throughout the remainder of 2016 and into early 2017, however the recent modest increase in spending and activity in some of the areas where we operate may be an early indicator of possible improvement in 2017. Although our compressor fleet horsepower utilization rates have decreased throughout the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the corresponding prior year period, we experienced an incrementally smaller sequential decrease in utilization in the third quarter of 2016 compared to earlier periods in the current year. The total HP of our compression services fleet exceeded 1,128,000 as of   September 30, 2016  , and the diversity of our compression services fleet allows us to utilize a wide range of compressor packages (from 20 HP to 2,370 HP) to provide compression services to customers. Our over-800 HP compressor fleet packages have performed at a higher utilization rate than our below-100 HP and our 101-800 HP compressor fleet packages in the current economic environment. The level of our future growth capital expenditures depends on forecasted demand for compression services. As a result of reduced demand, we are reviewing all capital expenditure plans carefully in an effort to conserve cash to fund our liquidity needs. A large portion of our reduced 2016 capital expenditures is associated with a system software development project designed to improve operating and administrative efficiencies beginning in 2017, allowing us to further reduce costs going forward. We plan to fund our capital expenditure needs through operating cash flows, borrowings under our Credit Agreement, and potentially other sources, if necessary. Our deferral of capital projects could affect our ability to compete in the future.     

How We Evaluate Our Operations 
    
  Operating Expenses  .     We use operating expenses as a performance measure for our business. We track our operating expenses using month-to-month, quarter-to-quarter, year-to-date, and year-to-year comparisons and as compared to budget. This analysis is useful in identifying adverse cost trends and     allows us to investigate the cause of these trends and implement remedial measures if possible. The most significant portions of our operating expenses are for our field labor, repair and maintenance of our equipment, and for the fuel and other supplies consumed while providing our services. Other materials consumed while performing our services, ad valorem taxes, other labor costs, truck maintenance, rent on storage facilities, and insurance expenses comprise the significant remainder of our operating expenses. Our operating expenses generally fluctuate with our level of activity. 
    
  Our labor costs consist primarily of wages     and benefits     for our field and fabrication personnel, as well as expenses related to their training and safety.     Additional     information regarding our operating expenses for the   three and nine   month periods     ended   September 30, 2016  , is provided within the Results of Operations sections     below. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA  .     We view Adjusted EBITDA as one of our primary management tools, and we track     it     on a monthly basis, both in dollars and as a percentage of revenues     (typically compared to the prior month,     prior year     period,     and to budget). We define Adjusted EBITDA as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and before certain non-cash charges, consisting of impairments, bad debt expense attributable to bankruptcy of customer, equity compensation, costs of compressors sold, fair value adjustments of our Preferred Units, and gain on extinguishment of debt, and excluding acquisition and transaction costs and severance. This definition conforms closely to the definition used in the financial covenant provisions in our Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements, including investors, to: 
             
    assess our ability to generate available cash sufficient to make distributions to our common unitholders and     General     Partner; 
                
    evaluate the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure, or historical cost basis; 
                
    measure operating performance and return on capital as compared to our competitors; and 
                
    determine our ability to incur and service debt and fund capital expenditures. 
       
       The following table     reconciles net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods indicated: 
  
   31 

The following table reconciles cash flow from operating activities to Adjusted EBITDA: 

Free Cash Flow  .   We define Free Cash Flow as cash from operations less capital expenditures, net of sales proceeds. Management primarily uses this metric to assess our ability to retire debt, evaluate our capacity to further invest and grow, and measure our performance as compared to our peers.  

32 

Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow are financial measures that are not in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (a "non-GAAP financial measure") and should not be considered an alternative to net income, operating income, cash flows from operating activities,     or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These measures may not be comparable to similarly titled financial metrics of other entities, as other entities may not calculate Adjusted EBITDA or Free Cash Flow in the same manner as     we do. Management compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable GAAP measures, understanding the differences between the measures,     and incorporating this knowledge into management s decision-making processes.     Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount we have available for distributions or that we plan to distribute for a given period, nor should it be equated with  available cash  as defined in our partnership agreement.  
    
    Horsepower Utilization Rate of our Compressor Packages  .     We measure the horsepower utilization rate of our fleet of compressor packages as the     amount of horsepower of compressor packages used to provide services as of a particular date, divided by     the     amount of horsepower of compressor packages in our services fleet     as of     such     date.     Management primarily uses this metric     to     determine our future need for additional compressor packages for our service fleet and to measure marketing effectiveness. 
    
  The     following table sets forth the total horsepower in our compression services fleet, our total horsepower in service, and our horsepower utilization rate as of the dates shown. 

The following table sets forth our horsepower utilization rates by each horsepower class of our compressor fleet as of the dates shown. 

Net Increases/Decreases in Compression Fleet Horsepower  .     We measure the net increase (or decrease) in our compression fleet horsepower during a given period of time by taking the difference between the aggregate horsepower of compressor packages added to the fleet during the period, less the aggregate horsepower of compressor packages removed from the fleet during the period. We measure the net increase (or decrease) in our compression fleet horsepower in service during a given period of time by taking the difference between the aggregate horsepower of compressor packages placed into service during the period, less the aggregate horsepower of compressor packages removed from service during the period.     Management uses these metrics to evaluate our operating performance and our relative size in the market.    
  Manufacturing and Backlog  .   Our equipment and parts sales business includes the fabrication and sale of standard compressor packages, custom-designed compressor packages, and oilfield fluid pump systems designed and fabricated primarily at our facility in Midland, Texas. The equipment is fabricated to customer and standard specifications, as applicable. Our custom fabrication projects are typically greater in size and scope than standard fabrication projects, requiring more labor, materials, and overhead resources. Our fabrication business requires diligent planning of those resources and project and backlog management in order to meet the customer delivery dates and performance criteria. As of   September 30, 2016  , our fabrication backlog was approximately   $20.8 million  , of which   $18.3 million   is expected to be recognized through the year ended   December 31, 2016  , based on title  
  
   33 

passing to the customer, the customer assuming the risks of ownership, reasonable assurance of collectability, and delivery occurring as directed by our customer. Our fabrication backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase or work order has been received, satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exists, and delivery has been scheduled. Our fabrication backlog is a measure of marketing effectiveness that allows us to plan future labor needs and measure our success in winning bids from our customers. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  There have been no material changes or developments in the evaluation of the accounting estimates and the underlying assumptions or methodologies pertaining to our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , except as described below. In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported. We periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those related to potential impairments of long-lived assets (including goodwill), the useful life of long-lived assets, the collectability of accounts receivable, and the allocation of acquisition purchase price. Our estimates are based on historical experience and on future expectations that we believe are reasonable.     The fair values of a large portion of our total assets and liabilities are measured using significant unobservable inputs. The combination of these factors forms the basis for judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not     readily apparent from other sources. These judgments and estimates may change as new events occur, as new information is acquired, and as changes in our operating environments are encountered. Actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates,     and those differences may be material. 
    
  Series A Preferred Units 
    
  Because the Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of common units, the fair value of the Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480 "Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity." The fair value of the Preferred Units as of   September 30, 2016   was   $88.1 million  . Changes in the fair value during each quarterly period, if any, are charged to other expense, net, in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. To calculate the estimated fair value of our Preferred Units, we utilize market information related to debt instruments, the trading price of our common units, and lattice modeling techniques. Because the Preferred Units are convertible into our common units at the option of the holder, the fair value of the Preferred Units will generally increase or decrease with the trading price of our common units, and this increase/decrease in Preferred Unit fair value will be charged/credited to earnings. Because of the volatility of market factors inherent in the estimation of the fair value of the Preferred Units, including the trading price of our common units, the volatility of our earnings may increase while the Preferred Units are outstanding. During the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , the estimated fair value of the Preferred Units increased to   $88.1 million  , resulting in a   $7.2 million   charge to other expense, net.  
    
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 
    
  We conduct a determination of impairment of long-lived assets, including identified intangible assets, periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present. If such indicators are present, the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives. If an impairment of a long-lived asset is warranted, we estimate the fair value of the asset based on a present value of these cash flows or the value that could be realized from disposing of the asset in a transaction between market participants. The estimation of future operating cash flows is inherently imprecise, and, if our estimates are materially incorrect, it could result in an overstatement or understatement of our financial position and results of operations. In particular, the oil and gas industry is cyclical, and estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated, as well as the predictability of these cash flows, can have an additional significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and, particularly in periods of prolonged down cycles, may result in impairment charges. Intangible assets recognized as part of the August 2014, acquisition of our Compressor Systems, Inc. subsidiary include trademark/tradename, customer relationships, and other intangible assets that are supported primarily by the estimated future cash flows of our operations. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $7.9 million   of impairments of long-lived assets, including certain identified intangible assets. Additional impairments of our long-lived assets could occur in the future, particularly in the event of a significant and sustained deterioration of natural gas production or pricing.

Impairment of Goodwill 
    
  We perform a goodwill impairment test on an annual basis or whenever indicators of impairment are present. The assessment for goodwill impairment begins with a qualitative assessment of whether it is  more likely than not  that the fair value of our business is less than its carrying value. This qualitative assessment requires the evaluation, based on the weight of evidence, of the significance of all identified events and circumstances. When the qualitative analysis indicates that it is  more likely than not  that our business  fair value is less than its carrying value, the resulting goodwill impairment test consists of a two-step accounting test being performed. The first step of the impairment test is to compare the estimated fair value with the recorded net book value (including goodwill) of our business. If the estimated fair value is higher than the recorded net book value, no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required. If, however, the recorded net book value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment loss is calculated by comparing the carrying amount of goodwill to our estimated implied fair value for that goodwill. Our estimates of our fair value, if required,     are based on a combination of an income approach and a market approach. These estimates are imprecise and subject to our estimates of the future cash flows of our business and our judgment as to how these estimated cash flows translate into our business  estimated fair value. These estimates and judgments are affected by numerous factors, including the general economic environment at the time of our assessment, which affects our overall market capitalization. If we overestimate the fair value of our business, the balance of our goodwill asset may be overstated. Alternatively, if our estimated fair values are understated, an impairment might be recognized unnecessarily or in excess of the appropriate amount. 
    
  Based on this qualitative assessment, we determined that due to the decrease in the market price of our common units that resulted in our market capitalization being less than the book value of our consolidated partners' capital as of December 31, 2015, it was  more likely than not  that the fair value of our business was less than its carrying value as of December 31, 2015. As a result of the goodwill assessment analysis described above, as of December 31, 2015, we recorded a partial impairment of   $139.4 million   of recorded goodwill, and the remaining amount of goodwill was   $92.4 million  . During the first three months of   2016  , global oil and natural gas commodity prices continued to be lower than in the prior year period. These decreases in commodity prices have had, and are expected to continue to have, a negative impact on industry drilling and capital expenditure activity, which affects demand for a portion of our products and services. As of March 31, 2016, our price per common unit had decreased approximately   46.3%   compared to December 31, 2015, resulting in an overall reduction in our market capitalization. Our market capitalization as of March 31, 2016 was also less than the recorded net book value, and uncertain market conditions resulting from current oil and natural gas prices continue. As a result, we concluded that it was "more likely than not" that the fair value of our business was less than its carrying value as of March 31, 2016. We have updated our internal business outlook to consider the current global economic environment that affects our operations. As part of the first step of goodwill impairment testing, we updated our assessment of our future cash flows, applying expected long-term growth rates, discount rates, and terminal values that we consider reasonable. We have calculated a present value of the cash flows to arrive at an estimate of fair value under the income approach, and then used the market approach to corroborate this value. As a result of these estimates, we determined that a full impairment of the remaining   $92.4 million   of goodwill was appropriate as of March 31, 2016.

Results of Operations 
    
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015    

Revenues 
    
  Compression and related services revenues   decreased     $19.7 million   in the current year quarter compared to the corresponding prior year quarter due to overall reduced demand for our compressor services fleet. Despite improving natural gas prices during much of 2016, demand for below-100 horsepower production enhancement compression and related services applications, including for liquids-rich resource plays and vapor recovery applications, continues to be decreased compared to the prior year period. In addition, the continued downturn in commodity prices since early 2015 has resulted in the reduction of utilization of our medium-horsepower (101-800 HP) and high- horsepower (over 800 HP) compression and related services applications, which include natural gas gathering and transmission applications. Although our compressor fleet horsepower utilization rates have decreased compared to the corresponding prior year period, we experienced an incrementally smaller sequential decrease in utilization in the third quarter of 2016 compared to the prior quarter. In response to decreased demand as a result of current oil and natural gas prices, we continue to restrict our growth capital expenditure plans for 2016. Aftermarket services revenues also decreased due to decreased demand compared to the prior year quarter. 
    
  In addition to the   decrease   in consolidated compression and related services revenues, there was a   decrease   of   $35.1 million   in revenues from the sales of equipment during the current year quarter compared to the corresponding prior year quarter. This   decrease   is primarily due to a lower number of customer projects compared to the prior year quarter, particularly projects involving larger horsepower compressor packages. The level of revenues from equipment sales is typically volatile and difficult to forecast, as these revenues are tied to specific customer projects that vary in scope, design, complexity, and customer needs. In comparison, our revenues from compression and related services and aftermarket services are typically more consistent and predictable. As reflected by the decreased level of new equipment sales fabrication backlog as of   September 30, 2016  , we expect future new equipment sales revenues to continue to be decreased compared to corresponding prior year periods. 

36 

Cost of revenues 
    
    The   decrease   in the cost of compression and related services revenue compared to the prior year quarter was primarily a result of the overall market decline compared to the corresponding prior year quarter, and due to the impact of cost reduction efforts. Despite the market decline, costs of compression and related services as a percent of associated revenues was consistent with the prior year quarter due to the impact of cost reduction efforts. The cost of compression and related services as a percentage of compression and related services revenues was   50.8%   and 48.2% during the current and prior year quarters, respectively.  
    
  Cost of equipment sales revenues decreased in accordance with the decrease in associated revenues. As a result of cost reduction efforts, the costs of equipment sales as a percentage of equipment sales revenues decreased despite the absorption of additional period costs per sales unit for the current year quarter compared to the corresponding prior year quarter. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense primarily consists of the depreciation of compressor packages in our service fleet. In addition,     it     includes the depreciation of other operating equipment and facilities and the amortization of intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense   decreased     $2.8 million   compared to the prior year quarter. Amortization expense decreased $1.6 million and depreciation expense decreased $1.1 million as a result of long-lived asset disposals and certain long-lived asset impairment charges incurred during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 that reduced the amount of our assets subject to amortization and depreciation.  
    
  Selling, general and administrative expense 
    
  Selling,     general and administrative     expenses have   decreased   during the current year quarter compared to the corresponding prior year quarter. This decrease is largely due to employee expenses, including salaries, incentives, benefits, and other employee related expenses, decreasing by $1.1 million as a result of salary and headcount reduction efforts. In addition, other general expenses such as office, tax, and insurance expenses decreased by $0.8 million, and allocated cost from TETRA pursuant to our Omnibus Agreement decreased $0.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased bad debt and other general expenses of $0.8 million and increased professional fees of $0.4 million. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues increased compared to the corresponding prior year period, reflecting the decrease in revenues compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
    
  Interest expense 
    
   Interest expense   increased   compared to the corresponding prior year period due to increased expense associated with the Preferred Units, due to the impact of paid in kind distributions that accrue to the holders of the Preferred Units. (See Note C - Series A Convertible Preferred Units for a further discussion of the Preferred Units.) Interest expense during the current and prior year periods also includes   $0.9 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively, of finance cost amortization and other non-cash charges. Increased interest expense in future periods as a result of paid in kind distributions on the Preferred Units is expected to be partially offset by the impact of our repurchase of   $54.1 million   principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes during September and October 2016. 
    
  Other expense, net 
    
  Other expense, net, was   $9.1 million   during the current year quarter compared to   $0.8 million   during the corresponding prior year     quarter.     The fair value of the Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480 "Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity" and changes in the fair value during each quarterly period, if any, are charged to other expense. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Preferred Units was   $88.1 million  , which resulted in a non-cash charge of   $7.2 million   to other expense during the portion of the current year quarter that the Preferred Units were outstanding. Changes in the fair value of the Preferred Units may generate additional volatility to our earnings going forward. In addition, $2.1 million of offering costs for the Preferred Units which were charged to other expense during the current year period. This charge was partially offset by   $0.5 million   of gain on the early extinguishment of   $20.0 million   principal amount of our 7.25% Senior Notes during September 2016. In addition, foreign currency translation expense decreased $0.6 million during the current year quarter compared to the corresponding prior year quarter. 
  
   37 

Provision for income taxes 
    
   As a partnership, we are generally not subject to income taxes at the entity level because our income is included in the tax returns of our partners. Our operations are treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes with each partner being separately taxed on its share of taxable income. However, a portion of our business is conducted through taxable U.S. corporate subsidiaries. Accordingly, a U.S. federal and state income tax provision has been reflected in the accompanying statements of operations. Certain of our operations are located outside of the U.S. and the Partnership, through its foreign subsidiaries, is responsible for income taxes in these countries.  
    
  Despite the pre-tax loss for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a provision for income tax, primarily attributable to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and Texas gross margin taxes. Our effective tax rate for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   was negative   1.3%   primarily due to losses generated in entities for which no related tax benefit has been recorded. The losses generated by these entities do not result in tax benefits due to offsetting valuation allowances being recorded against their net deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in our deferred tax assets are net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are available to offset future income tax liabilities in the U.S. as well as in certain foreign jurisdictions.  

Results of Operations 
    
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  

Revenues 
    
  Compression and related services revenues   decreased   by   $47.5 million   compared to the corresponding prior year period primarily due to the overall reduced demand for our compression services fleet. Decreases in oil  
  
   38 

and natural gas prices compared to the corresponding prior year period have adversely impacted the demand for below-100 horsepower production enhancement compression and related services applications, including for liquids-rich resource plays and vapor recovery applications. In addition, the continued downturn in commodity prices since the prior year period has resulted in the reduction of the utilization of our medium-horsepower (101-800 HP) and high- horsepower (over 800 HP) compression and related services applications, which include natural gas gathering and transmission applications. However, increasing natural gas prices during the most recent current year period have resulted in some improvement in demand for some of our services compared to earlier in 2016. Reductions in customer operating expenditures have also translated to less demand for aftermarket services as well, thus contributing to an   $8.6 million   decrease in revenues compared to the prior year period. In response to decreased demand as a result of current oil and natural gas prices, we continue to restrict our growth capital expenditure plans for 2016. 
    
  In addition to the   decrease   in consolidated compression and related services and aftermarket services revenues, there was a   decrease   of   $73.6 million   in revenues from the sales of equipment during the current year period, compared to the corresponding prior year period. This   decrease   is primarily due to a lower number of customer projects compared to prior year period, particularly projects requiring high-horsepower compressor packages. The level of revenues from equipment sales is typically volatile and difficult to forecast, as these revenues are tied to specific customer projects that vary in scope, design, complexity, and customer needs. In comparison, our revenues from compression and related services and aftermarket services are typically more consistent and predictable. As reflected by the decreased level of new equipment sales fabrication backlog as of   September 30, 2016  , we expect future new equipment sales revenues to continue to be decreased compared to corresponding prior year periods. 
    
  Cost of revenues 
    
    The   decrease   in the cost of compression and related services revenue, compared to the prior year period, was primarily due to the decreases in the associated compression and related services revenues that resulted from the overall market decline compared to the corresponding prior year period, and due to the impact of cost reduction efforts. Despite the market decline, the decrease in costs of compression and related services as a percent of associated revenues was less significant due to the impact of cost reduction efforts. The cost of compression and related services as a percentage of compression and related services revenues was   51.1%   during the current year period, compared to   49.6%   from the corresponding prior year period.  
    
  Cost of equipment sales revenues decreased in accordance with the decrease in associated revenues. As a result of cost reduction efforts, the costs of equipment sales as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly despite the absorption of additional period costs per sales unit for the current year period compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense primarily consists of the depreciation of compressor packages in our service fleet. In addition,     it     includes the depreciation of other operating equipment and facilities and the amortization of intangibles. Depreciation and amortization expense   decreased     $6.2 million   compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of a decrease in the amortization expense. The amortization expense decrease is a result of certain intangible asset impairment charges incurred during the fourth quarter of   2015   and the first quarter of 2016 that reduced the amount of our assets subject to amortization.  
    
  Long-lived asset impairments 
    
    During the first quarter of   2016  , we recorded total long-lived asset impairment charges of   $7.9 million   reflecting the decreased fair value for certain intangible assets as a result of decreased expected future cash flows to support their carrying value.  
    
  Selling, general and administrative expense 
    
  Selling,     general and administrative     expenses   decreased   during the current year period compared to the corresponding prior year period. This decrease is largely due to employee expenses, including salaries, incentives, benefits, and other employee related expenses, decreasing by $4.6 million as a result of salary and headcount reduction efforts. In addition, professional fees decreased by $0.4 million, tax and insurance expense decreased by  
  
   39 

$0.9 million, and allocated costs from TETRA pursuant to our Omnibus Agreement decreased by $0.4 million. These decreases were partially offset by $1.7 million of increased office, bad debt, repair and maintenance, and other general expenses. Selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues increased compared to the corresponding prior year period, reflecting the decrease in revenues compared to the corresponding prior year period. 
    
  Goodwill impairment 
    
  The continued decrease in demand along with the approximately   46.3%   decrease in our common unit price as of March 31, 2016 compared to   December 31, 2015  , caused a reduction in our overall fair value since   December 31, 2015  . When such triggering events have occurred, Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350-20 "Goodwill" requires that a test of goodwill impairment be performed consistent with the annual testing requirement that is required at year-end. As part of the test of goodwill impairment at quarter end, we estimated our fair value, and determined, based on this estimated value, that impairment of our goodwill was necessary, primarily due to the market factors discussed above. Accordingly, during the first quarter of   2016  , we recorded a full impairment charge associated with our remaining goodwill.  
    
  Interest expense 
    
   Interest expense   increased   compared to the corresponding prior year period due to increased expense associated with the Preferred Units, due to the impact of paid in kind distributions that accrue to the holders of Preferred Units. (See Note C - Series A Convertible Preferred Units for a further discussion of the Preferred Units.) Interest expense during the current and prior year periods includes   $3.2 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively, of finance cost amortization and other non-cash charges. Increased interest expense in future periods as a result of paid in kind distributions on the Preferred Units is expected to be partially offset by the impact of our repurchase of   $54.1 million   principal amount of our 7.25% Senior Notes during September and October 2016. 
    
  Other expense, net 
    
  Other expense, net, was   $10.1 million   during the current year period, compared to   $1.8 million   during the corresponding prior year period. The fair value of the Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480 "Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity" and changes in the fair value during each quarterly period, if any, are charged to other expense.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Preferred Units was   $88.1 million  , which resulted in a non-cash charge of   $7.2 million   to other expense during the portion of the current year period that the Preferred Units were outstanding. Changes in the fair value of the Preferred Units may generate additional volatility to our earnings going forward. In addition, $2.1 million of offering costs for the Preferred Units were charged to other expense during the current year period. This charge was partially offset by   $0.5 million   of gain on the early extinguishment of   $20.0 million   principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes during September 2016. In addition, foreign currency translation expense decreased $0.6 million during the current year period compared to the corresponding prior year period.  
    
  Provision for income taxes 
    
   As a partnership, we are generally not subject to income taxes at the entity level because our income is included in the tax returns of our partners. Our operations are treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes with each partner being separately taxed on its share of taxable income. However, a portion of our business is conducted through taxable U.S. corporate subsidiaries. Accordingly, a U.S. federal and state income tax provision has been reflected in the accompanying statements of operations. Certain of our operations are located outside of the U.S. and the Partnership, through its foreign subsidiaries, is responsible for income taxes in these countries.  
    
  Despite the significant pre-tax loss for the nine months period ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a provision for income tax, primarily attributable to taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions and Texas gross margin taxes. Our effective tax rate for the nine months period ended   September 30, 2016   was negative   1.2%   primarily due to losses generated in entities for which no related tax benefit has been recorded. The losses generated by these entities do not result in tax benefits due to offsetting valuation allowances being recorded against their net deferred tax assets. We establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Included in our deferred tax assets are net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that are available to offset future income tax liabilities in the U.S. as  
  
   40 

well as in certain foreign jurisdictions. Further, the effective tax rate is negatively impacted by the nondeductible portion of our goodwill impairments during the nine months period ended   September 30, 2016  .  

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Our primary cash requirements are for distributions, working capital requirements, normal operating expenses, and capital expenditures. Our     sources     of funds are     our existing cash balances, cash generated from our operations, long-term and short-term borrowings, and leases, which we believe will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements during the remainder of   2016   and into 2017. Increasingly competitive market environments, along with the continued low oil and natural gas prices, have resulted in additional challenges in each of our domestic and international business regions. Future levels of revenues and operating cash flows will continue to be negatively affected by the decreased demand for certain of our products and services during the ongoing period of low oil and natural gas prices. While remaining committed to a long-term growth strategy, our near-term focus during this period of reduced demand is to preserve and enhance liquidity through strategic operating and financial measures. 
    
  Our cash flows from operating activities   decreased   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to the corresponding prior year period by   $18.0 million  , primarily as a result of decreased earnings. Cash flows used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased     $68.5 million   when compared to the corresponding prior year period, reflecting the decision to defer service fleet expansion and other capital expenditures. Cash flows used in financing activities were   $34.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to cash flows used in financing activities of   $2.8 million   in the corresponding prior year period, primarily as a result of the repayment of a portion of the balance outstanding under our Credit Agreement and our repurchase of a portion of our 7.25% Senior Notes, offset by the proceeds received from the issuances of the Preferred Units. A summary of our sources and uses of cash during the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

We are in compliance with all covenants of our Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . We have reviewed our financial forecasts as of   November 9, 2016   for the twelve month period subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , which consider the impact of recent cost reduction efforts, the May and November 2016 amendments to our Credit Agreement, and the proceeds received from our private placements of Preferred Units. Based on this review and the current market conditions as of   November 9, 2016  , we believe that despite the current industry environment and activity levels, we will have adequate liquidity, earnings, and operating cash flows to fund our operations and debt obligations and maintain compliance with debt covenants through September 30, 2017. We expect to fund any future acquisitions and capital expenditures with cash flow generated from our operations, funds available under our Credit Agreement, and funds received from the issuance of additional debt and equity securities. However, we are subject to business and operational risks that could materially adversely affect our cash flows.     Please     read Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Future growth in our operations, both internationally and in the U.S., may require     ongoing     significant capital expenditure     investment. The level of future growth capital expenditures depends on forecasted demand for compression services. If the forecasted demand for compression services during   2016   and 2017 increases or decreases, the amount of planned expenditures on growth and expansion will be adjusted accordingly. We have adjusted our expected capital expenditures and anticipate that our total gross capital expenditures (excluding asset disposals and associated proceeds) in   2016   will range from   $19.0 million   to   $20.0 million  , including   $11.0 million   to   $12.0 million   of maintenance capital expenditures. During the current period of reduced oil and natural gas prices, we are reviewing all capital expenditure plans carefully in an effort to conserve cash and fund our liquidity needs. The deferral of capital projects could affect our ability to compete in the future. 

41 

Our capital expenditure program consists of both expansion capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures. Expansion capital expenditures consist of expenditures for acquisitions or capital improvements that increase our capacity, either by fabricating new compressor packages to expand our compression services fleet, purchasing support equipment or other assets, or through the upgrading of existing compressor packages to increase their capabilities. Expansion capital expenditures generally result in our ability to generate increased revenues. Maintenance capital expenditures consist of expenditures to maintain our compressor package fleet or support equipment without increasing its capacity. Maintenance capital expenditures are intended to maintain or sustain the current level of operating capacity and include the maintenance of existing assets and the replacement of obsolete assets. Routine repair and maintenance is charged to expense as incurred. A large portion of our 2016 capital expenditures is associated with a system software development project designed to improve operating and administrative efficiencies beginning in 2017, allow us to further reduce costs going forward. 
    
  On   October 21, 2016  , our General Partner declared a cash distribution attributable to the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of   $0.3775   per common unit. This distribution equates to a distribution of   $1.51   per outstanding common unit, on an annualized basis. Also on   October 21, 2016  , our General Partner approved the paid-in-kind distribution of   77,149   Preferred Units attributable to the portion of the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   when the Preferred Units were outstanding, in accordance with the provisions of our partnership agreement, as amended. These quarterly distributions are to be paid on   November 14, 2016   to all holders of common units and Preferred Units, respectively, of record as of the close of business on   November 1, 2016  .  

Cash Flows 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash from operating activities   decreased   by   $18.0 million   during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   to   $45.5 million   compared to   $63.5 million   for     the corresponding prior year     period. Cash provided from operating activities   decreased   during the first   nine   months of   2016   primarily as a result of decreased earnings. We continue to monitor the evolving financial condition of many of our customers during this current downturn, balancing the benefits of generating operating cash flows with the risk of exposing our businesses to additional credit risk exposure. Our cash provided from operating activities is primarily generated from the provision of compression and related services and the sale of new compression packages. As reflected by the decreased demand for compression and related services and the decreased level of new equipment sales fabrication backlog as of   September 30, 2016  , we expect revenues and operating cash flows to continue to be decreased compared to prior periods. 
    
  Cash provided from our foreign operations is subject to various uncertainties, including the volatility associated with interruptions caused by customer     budgetary decisions, uncertainties regarding the renewal of our existing customer contracts, and other changes in contract arrangements,     security concerns,     the timing of collection of our receivables, and the repatriation of cash generated by our operations.  
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Capital expenditures during     the   nine     month period ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $68.4 million   compared to the corresponding prior year     period, reflecting the deferral of a significant amount of fleet expansion and other capital expenditure projects in light of current demand levels. Total capital expenditures, net of disposals and proceeds, during the current year period of   $7.6 million   include   $6.5 million   of maintenance capital expenditures and are net of   $2.8 million   of non-cash cost of compression units sold.  A large portion of our 2016 capital expenditures is associated with a system software development project designed to improve operating and administrative efficiencies beginning in 2017 and allow us to further reduce costs going forward. The level of growth capital expenditures depends on forecasted demand for compression services. If the forecasted demand for compression services during   2016   and 2017 increases or decreases, the amount of planned expenditures on growth and expansion will be adjusted accordingly. During the current period of reduced oil and natural gas prices, we are reviewing all capital expenditure plans carefully in an effort to conserve cash and fund our liquidity needs.  
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Our partnership agreement requires that, within 45 days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash, as defined in our Partnership Agreement, to our common unitholders of record on the applicable  
  
   42 

record date and to our General Partner. In addition, our partnership agreement, as amended in August 2016, requires that, within 45 days after the end of each quarter, we make a distribution to holders of our Preferred Units of additional paid in kind Preferred Units, equal to 2.75% of the Issue Price (11% of $11.43 per Preferred Unit on an annualized basis). During the     nine     month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we distributed   $38.4 million   of cash distributions to our common unitholders and General Partner. This distribution equated to   $1.1325   per common unit. On   October 21, 2016  , our General Partner declared a cash distribution attributable to the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of   $0.3775   per common unit. This distribution equates to a distribution of   $1.51   per outstanding common unit on an annualized basis. Also on   October 21, 2016  , our General Partner approved the paid-in-kind distribution of   77,149   Preferred Units attributable to the portion of the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   for which the Preferred Units were outstanding. These distributions are to be paid on   November 14, 2016   to all holders of our common units and Preferred Units, respectively, of record as of the close of business on   November 1, 2016  .  
    
  Series A Convertible Preferred Units 
    
  On   August 8, 2016   and   September 20, 2016  , we entered into Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreements (the  Unit Purchase Agreements ) with certain purchasers with regard to our issuance and sale in private placements (the "Initial Private Placement" and "Subsequent Private Placement," respectively) of an aggregate of   6,999,126   Preferred Units for a cash purchase price of   $11.43   per Preferred Unit (the  Issue Price ), resulting in total net proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, of approximately   $77.3 million  . One of the purchasers in the Initial Private Placement was TETRA, which purchased   874,891   of the Preferred Units at the aggregate Issue Price of   $10.0 million  . Proceeds from the Initial Private Placement and Subsequent Private Placement were used to pay additional offering expenses and reduce outstanding indebtedness under our Credit Agreement and our 7.25% Senior Notes.  
    
  In connection with the closing of the Initial Private Placement, our General Partner executed a Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the  Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement ) to, among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the Preferred Units. The Preferred Units are a new class of equity security that will rank senior to all classes or series of equity securities of the Partnership with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. The holders of Preferred Units (each, a  Preferred Unitholder ) will receive quarterly distributions, which will be paid in kind in additional Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of 11.00% of the Issue Price (or   $1.2573   per Preferred Unit annualized), subject to certain adjustments. The rights of the Preferred Units include certain anti-dilution adjustments, including adjustments for economic dilution resulting from the issuance of common units in the future below a set price.  
    
  A ratable portion of the Preferred Units will be converted into common units on the eighth day of each month over a period of thirty months beginning in March 2017 (each, a  Conversion Date ), subject to certain provisions of the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement that may delay or accelerate all or a portion of such monthly conversions. On each Conversion Date, a portion of the Preferred Units will convert into common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership in an amount equal to, with respect to each Preferred Unitholder, the number of Preferred Units held by such Preferred Unitholder divided by the number of Conversion Dates remaining, subject to adjustment described in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement, with the conversion price determined by the trading prices of the common units over the prior month, among other factors, and as otherwise impacted by the existence of certain conditions related to the common units. The maximum number of common units that could be required to be issued pursuant to the conversion provisions of the Preferred Units is potentially unlimited; however, the Partnership may, at its option, pay cash, or a combination of cash and common units, to the Preferred Unitholders instead of issuing common units on any Conversion Date, subject to certain restrictions as described in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement and the Credit Agreement. 
    
  In addition, each purchaser may convert its Preferred Units, generally on a one-for-one basis and subject to adjustment for certain splits, combinations, reclassifications or other similar transactions and certain anti-dilution adjustments, in whole or in part, at any time following May 31, 2017 so long as any conversion is not for less than $250,000 or such lesser amount, if such conversion relates to all of such purchaser s remaining Preferred Units. The Partnership has the right to be reimbursed for any cash distributions paid with respect to common units issued in any such optional conversion until March 31, 2018. The Preferred Units will vote on an as-converted basis with the Common Units and will have certain other rights to vote as a class with respect to any amendment to the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement that would affect any rights, preferences or privileges of the Preferred Units, as more fully described in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement. 

43 

Because the Preferred Units may be settled using a variable number of common units, the fair value of the Preferred Units is classified as a long-term liability on our consolidated balance sheet in accordance with ASC 480 "Distinguishing Liabilities and Equity." The fair value of the Preferred Units as of   September 30, 2016   was   $88.1 million  . Changes in the fair value during each quarterly period, if any, are charged to other expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Charges to earnings for changes in the fair value of the Preferred Units, along with the accrual and payment of paid-in-kind distributions associated with the Preferred Units, are non-cash charges associated with the Preferred Units. 
    
  In addition, the Unit Purchase Agreement includes certain provisions regarding change of control, transfer of Preferred Units, indemnities, and other matters described in detail in the Unit Purchase Agreement. The Unit Purchase Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of the Partnership and the purchasers.  
    
  Bank Credit Facilities    
    
  Under our Credit Agreement, as amended in November 2016, we and our CSI Compressco Sub, Inc. subsidiary are named as the borrowers and all obligations under our Credit Agreement are guaranteed by all of our existing and future, direct and indirect, domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than domestic subsidiaries that are wholly owned by foreign subsidiaries). Our Credit Agreement, as amended, includes a maximum credit commitment of $315.0 million, and included within such amount is availability for letters of credit (with a sublimit of $20.0 million) and swingline loans (with a sublimit of $60.0 million). As a result of the amendment in November 2016, the Credit Agreement is now an asset-based facility.  
    
  As of   November 8, 2016   we have a balance outstanding under our Credit Agreement of   $219.0 million  , and   $8.0 million   letters of credit and performance bonds outstanding, leaving availability under the Credit Agreement of   $88.0 million  . Availability under the Credit Agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculation based on components of accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment as well as subject to compliance with covenants and other provisions in the Credit Agreement that may limit borrowings under the Credit Agreement.  
    
  Our Credit Agreement is available to provide our working capital needs, letters of credit, and for general partnership purposes, including capital expenditures and potential future expansions or acquisitions. So long as we are not in default, and maintain excess availability of $30.0 million, our Credit Agreement can also be used to fund our quarterly distributions at the option of the board of directors of our General Partner (provided, that after giving effect to such distributions, we will be in compliance with the financial covenants). Borrowings under the Credit Agreement are subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including the absence of a default. Our Credit Agreement matures in   August 2019  .    
    
  Borrowings under our Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at our option, either (a) LIBOR (adjusted to reflect any required bank reserves) for an interest period equal to one, two, three, or six months (as selected by us), plus a leverage based margin or (b) a base rate plus a leverage-based margin; such base rate shall be determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of interest per annum announced from time to time by Bank of America, N.A. (2) the Federal Funds rate plus 0.50% per annum and (3) LIBOR (adjusted to reflect any required bank reserves) for a one-month interest period on such day plus 1.00% per annum. LIBOR based loans will have an applicable margin that will range between 2.00% and 3.25% per annum and base rate loans will have an applicable margin that will range between 1.00% and 2.25% per annum, according to the applicable consolidated total leverage ratio when financial statements are delivered.     In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under our Credit Agreement, we are required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder at the applicable rate ranging from 0.375% to 0.50% per annum, paid quarterly in arrears based on our consolidated total leverage ratio. We are required to pay a customary letter of credit fee equal to the applicable margin on revolving credit LIBOR loans, fronting fees and other fees agreed to with the administrative agent and lenders. 
    
  Our Credit Agreement requires us to maintain (i) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (defined ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest charges) of (a) 2.25 to 1 as of the fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016 through June 30, 2018; (b) 2.50 to 1 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018; and (c) 2.75 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 and thereafter, (ii) a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio (ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA ) of (a) 5.75 to 1 as of September 30, 2016; (b) 5.95 to 1 as of December 31, 2016 through June 30, 2018; (c) 5.75 to 1 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018; and (d) 5.50 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 and thereafter, and (iii)  
  
   44 

a maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio (consolidated secured indebtedness to consolidated EBITDA) of (a) 3.25 to 1 as of September 30, 2016 through June 30, 2018; and (b) 3.50 to 1 as of September 30, 2018 and thereafter, calculated on a trailing four quarters basis.  At   September 30, 2016  , our consolidated total leverage ratio was   4.83   to 1, our consolidated secured leverage ratio was   1.75   to 1, and our consolidated interest coverage ratio was   3.36   to 1. In addition, our Credit Agreement includes customary covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional debt, incur, or permit certain liens to exist, or make certain loans, investments, acquisitions, or other restricted payments. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that, among other conditions, we use designated consolidated cash and cash equivalent balances in excess of $35.0 million to prepay the loans; allows the prepayment or purchase of indebtedness with proceeds from the issuances of equity securities or in exchange for the issuances of equity securities; and restricts the amount of our permitted capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business during each fiscal year ranging from $25.0 million in 2016 to $75.0 million in 2019.  
    
  The consolidated total leverage ratio and the consolidated secured leverage ratio, as both are calculated under the Credit Agreement, exclude the long-term liability for the Preferred Units in the determination of total indebtedness.      
    
  We are in compliance with all covenants and conditions of our Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . Our continuing ability to comply with our covenants depends largely upon our ability to generate adequate earnings and operating cash flow. Historically, our financial performance has been more than adequate to meet these covenants. Given the expected decreased demand for certain of our products and services by our customers in response to decreased oil and natural gas prices, we have taken strategic cost reduction efforts, including headcount reductions, wage reductions, deferral of wage increases, and other efforts to reduce costs and generate cash in anticipation of the reduced demand for our products and services. We believe the steps taken have enhanced our operating cash flows and preserved our cash, and additional steps may be taken to continue to enhance our operating cash flows and preserve cash in the future. We have reviewed our financial forecasts as of   November 9, 2016   for the twelve month period subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , which consider the impact of recent cost reduction efforts, the recent amendments to our Credit Agreement, and the   $77.3 million   of net proceeds received from our recent private placements of Preferred Units. Based on this review and the current market conditions as of   November 9, 2016  , we believe that despite the current industry environment and activity levels, we will have adequate liquidity, earnings, and operating cash flows to fund our operations and debt obligations and maintain compliance with debt covenants through September 30, 2017. 
    
  All obligations under the Credit Agreement and the guarantees of those obligations are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by a first lien security interest in substantially all of our assets and the assets of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries, and all of the capital stock of our existing and future subsidiaries (limited in the case of foreign subsidiaries, to 65% of the voting stock of first tier foreign subsidiaries).  
    
  7.25% Senior Notes 
    
  The obligations under the 7.25% Senior Notes due 2022 (the "7.25% Senior Notes") are jointly and severally, and fully and unconditionally, guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our domestic restricted subsidiaries (other than CSI Compressco Finance) that guarantee our other indebtedness (the "Guarantors" and together with the Issuers, the "Obligors"). The 7.25% Senior Notes and the subsidiary guarantees thereof (together, the "Securities") were issued pursuant to an indenture described below.  
    
  The Obligors issued the Securities pursuant to the Indenture dated as of August 4, 2014 (the "Indenture") by and among the Obligors and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). The 7.25% Senior Notes accrue interest at a rate of 7.25% per annum. Interest on the 7.25% Senior Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 7.25% Senior Notes are scheduled to mature on   August 15, 2022  . 
    
  The Indenture contains customary covenants restricting our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to: (i) pay dividends and make certain distributions, investments and other restricted payments; (ii) incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; (iii) create certain liens; (iv) sell assets; (v) merge, consolidate, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our or their assets; (vi) enter into transactions with affiliates; and (vii) designate our or their subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries under the Indenture. The Indenture also contains customary events of default and acceleration provisions relating to such events of default, which provide that upon an event of default under the Indenture, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the 7.25% Senior Notes then outstanding may declare all amounts owing under the  
  
   45 

7.25% Senior Notes to be due and payable. We are in compliance with all covenants of the Indenture as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In September 2016, we repurchased on the open market and retired   $20.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes for a purchase price of   $18.8 million  , at an average repurchase price of   94%   of the principal amount of the 7.25% Senior Notes, plus accrued interest, utilizing a portion of the net proceeds of the sale of the Preferred Units. In connection with the repayment of these 7.25% Senior Notes,   $0.5 million   of early extinguishment net gain was credited to other expense/income during the three month period ended September 30, 2016, representing the difference between the repurchase price and the $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 7.25% Senior Notes repurchased, and   $0.7 million   of remaining unamortized deferred finance costs and discounts associated with the repurchased 7.25% Senior Notes. In October 2016, we repurchased on the open market and retired an additional   $34.1 million   aggregate principal amount of 7.25% Senior Notes, for a purchase price of   $32.1 million   plus accrued interest. As of   November 8, 2016  ,   $295.9 million   in aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% Senior Notes are outstanding.  
    
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no  off balance sheet arrangements  that may have a current or future material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. 

Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  From time to time, we are     involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business.     While the outcome of     these     lawsuits     or other proceedings     against     us     cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not     consider it reasonably possible that a loss resulting from such lawsuits or proceedings in excess of any amounts accrued has been incurred that is     expected to     have a material adverse effect on our financial     condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
    
  Our contractual obligations and commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness and obligations under operating leases.  
    
  The table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of   September 30, 2016  : 

(1)   
    Amounts exclude other long-term liabilities reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheet that do not have known cash payment streams. These excluded amounts include approximately     $88.1 million carrying value of liabilities related to the Series A Convertible Preferred Units. The preferred units are expected to be serviced and satisfied with non-cash paid-in-kind distributions and conversions to common units. See "Note C-Series A Convertible Preferred Units," in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

    information technology risks including the risk from cyberattack, and 
                
    other risks and uncertainties under  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , and as included in our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), which are available free of charge on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. 
       
  The risks and uncertainties referred to above are generally beyond our ability to control and we cannot predict all the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ from those indicated by the forward-looking statements.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures     About Market Risk 
    
  Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices. We do not take title to any natural gas or oil     in connection with our services and, accordingly, have no direct exposure to fluctuating     commodity     prices. While we have a significant number of customers who have retained our services through     periods of     high and low     commodity     prices, we generally experience less growth and more customer attrition during periods of significantly high or low     commodity     prices. For     a discussion of our indirect exposure to fluctuating     commodity     prices, please read  Risk Factors       Certain     Business     Risks  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on   March 11, 2016  .     We depend on domestic and international demand for and production of     natural gas and oil and a reduction in this demand or production could adversely affect the demand or the prices we charge for our services, which could cause our revenues     and cash available for distribution to our common unitholders to decrease     in the     future.     We do not     currently hedge, and do not     intend to hedge,     our indirect exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Through   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes in the information pertaining to our interest rate risk exposures as disclosed in our Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

47 

Exchange Rate Risk 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes pertaining to our exchange rate exposures as disclosed in our Form 10-K/A for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  

Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Under the supervision and with the participation     of our management, including the     Principal Executive Officer and Principal     Financial Officer     of our     General     Partner, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Based on this evaluation, the     Principal     Executive Officer and     Principal     Financial Officer     of our     General     Partner     concluded that, except with respect to the event described below, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  ,     the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. 
    
  On August 4, 2014 we completed the acquisition of our Compressor Systems, Inc. subsidiary ("CSI"). During the year ended December 31, 2015, we implemented controls and procedures related to the CSI business as part of our integration of CSI into our internal control over financial reporting processes. As reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on   March 11, 2016  , we identified a material weakness with regard to our internal control over financial reporting related to our aftermarket services and parts sales revenues associated with our CSI business. Remediation steps have been implemented to establish controls over aftermarket services and parts sales and testing of these controls  began in the third quarter of 2016.  
    
  Other than the changes described above in the preceding paragraph, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II 
  OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.     Legal Proceedings. 
    
  From time to time, we are     involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business.     While the outcome of     these     lawsuits     or other proceedings     against     us     cannot be predicted with certainty, management does not     consider it reasonably possible that a loss resulting from such lawsuits or proceedings in excess of any amounts accrued has been incurred that is     expected to     have a material adverse effect on our financial     condition, results of operations, or cash flows. 

Item 1A.     Risk Factors. 
    
   There have been no material changes in the information pertaining to our Risk Factors as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with SEC on   March 11, 2016  , except for the following: 
    
  Deterioration of our financial ratios could result in covenant defaults under our Credit Agreement and result in decreased credit availability.  
    
  As of   November 8, 2016  , our outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement were   $219.0 million  . In addition, we have   $295.9 million   in aggregate principal amount of our 7.25% Senior Notes outstanding. We depend on the earnings and cash flow generated by our operations to meet our debt service obligations. Payment of our debt service obligations reduces cash available for distribution to our common unitholders. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants applicable to our Credit Agreement and the 7.25% Senior Notes restrict our ability to take certain actions. Violations of these restrictions and covenants may result in a breach of, or our inability to borrow under, our Credit Agreement, including to fund distributions (if we elected to do so). 
    
  Our Credit Agreement, as amended by the Fourth Amendment entered into on   November 3, 2016  , requires us to maintain (i) a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio (defined ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated interest charges) of (a) 2.25 to 1 as of September, 2016 through June 30, 2018; (b) 2.50 to 1 as of September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2018; and (c) 2.75 to 1 as of March 31, 2019 and thereafter, (ii) a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio (ratio of consolidated  
  
   48

Access to our Credit Agreement is dependent upon our compliance with covenants as well as the borrowing base and other provisions set forth in the Credit Agreement. Our Credit Agreement contains additional restrictive provisions ("cash dominion provisions") that are imposed if an event of default has occurred and is continuing or excess availability under the asset-based revolving credit facility ("ABL Facility")  falls below $30.0 million. Our Credit Agreement further provides that we may make distributions to holders of our common units, but only if there is no default under the agreement and we maintain excess availability of $30.0 million. Our ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our Credit Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial, and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants may be impaired. A failure to comply with the provisions of our Credit Agreement could result in an event of default. Upon an event of default, unless waived, the lenders under our Credit Agreement would have all remedies available to secured lenders and could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans, require cash collateralization of letters of credit, cause their loans to become due and payable in full, institute foreclosure proceedings against our or our subsidiaries  assets, and force us and our subsidiaries into bankruptcy or liquidation. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and the holders of our common units could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. An event of default under our Credit Agreement could also result in an event of default under our 7.25% Senior Notes. 
    
  We are in compliance with all covenants of our Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  . Our continuing ability to comply with covenants depends largely upon our ability to generate adequate cash flow. As a result of the recent decreased demand for certain of our products and services by our customers in response to decreased oil and natural gas prices beginning in 2014, and our expectation that the reduced demand will continue for an indefinite period, we have taken strategic cost reduction efforts, including headcount reductions, deferral of salary increases, salary reductions, and other efforts to reduce costs and generate cash. We believe the steps taken have enhanced our operating cash flows and preserved our cash, and additional steps may be taken to continue to enhance our operating cash flows and preserve cash in the future. We have reviewed our financial forecasts as of   November 9, 2016   for the twelve month period subsequent to   September 30, 2016   which consider the impact of recent cost reduction efforts, the recent amendments to our Credit Agreement, and the   $77.3 million   of net proceeds received from our recent private placements of Preferred Units. Based on this review and the current market conditions as of   November 9, 2016  , we believe that despite the current industry environment and activity levels, we will have adequate liquidity, earnings, and operating cash flows to fund our operations and debt obligations and maintain compliance with our Credit Agreement debt covenants through September 30, 2017. However, there can be no assurance that we will remain in compliance with one or more of our covenants of our Credit Agreement in the future.  
    
    The Series A Convertible Preferred Units issued in     August 2016     and     September 2016     are senior in right of distributions, liquidation and voting to the common units, and will result in the issuance of additional partnership common units in the future, resulting in dilution of our existing common unitholders  ownership interests, and such dilution is potentially unlimited. 
    
  Our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional partnership common units that we may issue at any time without the approval of our common unitholders. In addition, subject to the provisions of the Series A Preferred Unit Purchase Agreement, we may issue an unlimited number of partnership units that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation, or voting. On   August 8, 2016  , we issued an aggregate of   4,374,454   of Series A Convertible Preferred Units (the "Preferred Units") for a cash purchase price of   $11.43   per Preferred Unit (the  Issue Price ), resulting in total net proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, of   $49.8 million  . Additionally on   September 20, 2016  , we issued an aggregate of   2,624,672   of Preferred Units for a cash purchase price of   $11.43   per Preferred Unit, resulting in total net proceeds, after deducting certain offering expenses, of   $29.0 million  . 
    
  Pursuant to the Series A Convertible Unit Purchase Agreement on   August 8, 2016  , our general partner executed the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the  Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement ) to, among other things, authorize and establish the rights and preferences of the Preferred Units. The Preferred Units are a new class of equity security that ranks senior to all classes or series  
  
   49 

of our equity securities with respect to distribution rights and rights upon liquidation. The holders of Preferred Units (each, a  Preferred Unitholder ) will receive quarterly distributions in kind in additional Preferred Units, equal to an annual rate of 11.00% of the Issue Price (  $1.2573   per unit annualized), subject to certain adjustments, including adjustments related to any future issuances of common units below a set price. Beginning on the first Trading Day (as defined in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement) after the seventh calendar month following the closing date and on the first Trading Day of each calendar month thereafter for a total of thirty months (each, a  Conversion Date ), the Preferred Units will convert into common units representing limited partner interests in the partnership in an amount equal to, with respect to each Preferred Unitholder, the number of Preferred Units held by such Preferred Unitholder divided by the number of Conversion Dates remaining. We may, at our option, pay cash, or a combination of cash and common units, to the Preferred Unitholders instead of issuing common units on any Conversion Date, subject to certain restrictions as described in the Amended and Restated Partnership Agreement and the Credit Agreement. 
    
  The issuance by us of the Preferred Units will have the following effects: 
             
    our previously existing common unitholders  proportionate ownership interests in us will decrease; 
                
    the amount of cash available for distribution on each common unit may decrease; 
                
    the relative voting power of our previously existing common unitholders will be diminished; and 
                
    the market price of the common units may decline.
