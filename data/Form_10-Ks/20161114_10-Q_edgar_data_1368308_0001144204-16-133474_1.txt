1.    The Company and basis of presentation    

The consolidated financial statements
include the financial statements of Highpower International, Inc. ( Highpower ) and its subsidiaries, Hong Kong Highpower
Technology Company Limited ( HKHTC ), Shenzhen Highpower Technology Company Limited ( SZ Highpower ), Springpower
Technology (Shenzhen) Company Limited ( SZ Springpower ), Ganzhou Highpower Technology Company Limited ( GZ Highpower ),
Icon Energy System Company Limited ( ICON ) and Huizhou Highpower Technology Company Limited ( HZ HTC ).
Highpower and its subsidiaries are collectively referred to as the  Company . 

Basis of presentation  

The accompanying consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited financial statements, and the unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared
pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Certain information and
disclosures, which are normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (U.S. GAAP), have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The interim financial information
should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, previously filed with the SEC on March 29, 2016. 

In the opinion of management,
all adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present a fair presentation of the Company s consolidated
financial position as of September 30, 2016, its consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been made. The interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the operating
results for the full fiscal year or any future periods.

2.    Summary of significant accounting policies    

Reclassification  

The Company has reclassified
certain comparative balances in the consolidated balance sheet for December 31, 2015 to conform to the current period s presentation.
The reclassification is related to the aggregation of the balance of prepayments and the balance of other receivables into the
balance of prepayments and other receivables. The reclassification did not have an impact on the reported total assets, liabilities
and stockholders  equity. 

Concentrations of credit risk  

No customer accounted for 10%
or more of total sales during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

No supplier accounted for 10%
or more of the total purchase amount during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

No customer accounted for 10%
or more of the accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, there was one major customer accounted for
11.3% of the accounts receivable. 

Long-term investment  

Investments in equity securities
of privately-held companies in which the Company holds less than 20% voting interest are accounted for under the cost method. Investments
in equity securities of privately-held companies in which the Company has between 20% and 50% of ownership interest in the voting
stock, and to which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method.
Significant influence is generally considered to exist when the Company has between 20% and 50% of ownership interest in the voting
stock, but other factors, such as representation on the board of directors, voting rights and the impact of commercial arrangements,
are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate. 

Entities in which the Company
has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not have a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity
method. 

The Company evaluates potential
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investments may not be recoverable.
For investments carried at cost, the Company recognizes impairment in the event that the carrying value of the investment exceeds
the Company s proportionate share of the net book value of the investee. As of September 30, 2016, management believes no
impairment charge is necessary. 

Foreign currency translation
and transactions  

Highpower s functional
currency is the United States dollar ( US$ ). HKHTC's functional currency is the Hong Kong dollar ( HK$ ).
The functional currency of the Company s subsidiaries in the PRC is the Renminbi ( RMB ). 

Most of the Company s oversea
sales are priced and settled with US$. At the date a foreign currency transaction is recognized, each asset, liability, revenue,
expense, gain, or loss arising from the transaction is measured initially in the functional currency of the recording entity by
use of the exchange rate in effect at that date. The increase or decrease in expected functional currency cash flows upon settlement
of a transaction resulting from a change in exchange rates between the functional currency and the currency in which the transaction
is denominated is recognized as foreign currency transaction gain or loss that is included in determining net income for the period
in which the exchange rate changes. At each balance sheet date, recorded balances that are denominated in a foreign currency are
adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate. 

The Company s reporting
currency is US$. Assets and liabilities of HKHTC and the PRC subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate at the balance
sheet dates, revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates during the reporting periods, and equity accounts
are translated at historical rates. Translation adjustments are reported in other comprehensive income.

2.    Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)    

Recently issued accounting
pronouncements  

In May 2014, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASU 2014-09. This new standard will replace all
current U.S. GAAP guidance on this topic and eliminate all industry-specific guidance. The new revenue recognition standard provides
a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue
to correlate with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective
date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, while allowing a company to adopt the new revenue standard early but not before the original effective
date. This guidance will be effective as to us on January 1, 2018 and can be applied either retrospectively to each period presented
or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. In April and May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, or ASU 2016-10, and Accounting Standards Update 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts
with Customers, or ASU 2016-12, respectively. These new standards will identify performance obligations and narrow aspects on achieving
core principle. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting these ASUs on our consolidated financial statements. 

On February
25, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). It requires that a lessee recognize the
assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability
to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the
lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of
underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize
and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Public business entities
should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within
those fiscal years (i.e., January 1, 2019, for a calendar year entity). Early application is permitted for all public business
entities and all nonpublic business entities upon issuance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02
on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March
2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-07, Investments-Equity Method and Joint Venture (Topic 323). The amendments
require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis
of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes
qualified for equity method accounting. It is effective for all entities for the fiscal years, and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. The Company did not earlier adopt ASU 2016-07
on our consolidated financial statement. 

In August
2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). The amendments in this Update
provide guidance on eight specific cash flow issue. It applies to all entities. For public business entities, the amendments in
this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
ASU 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 

In October
2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740). The amendments in this Update is to
improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory and align the recognition
of income tax consequences for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRS). Public business entities should apply the amendments in ASU 2016-16 for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 on our consolidated financial statements. 

We do not
believe other recently issued but not yet effective accounting standards, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on
the consolidated financial position, statements of operations and cash flows.

The real estate properties
and buildings in Huizhou and Ganzhou have been pledged as collateral for short-term loans and bank acceptance bills drawn under
certain lines of credit as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The real estate properties and buildings in Shenzhen have
been pledged as collateral for short-term loans and bank acceptance bills drawn under certain lines of credit as of September 30,
2016. 

6.    Long-term investment    

On April 1, 2016, the Company
entered into an investment agreement with Huizhou Yipeng Energy Technology Co. Ltd. ( Yipeng ), whereby the Company acquired
5% equity interest of Yipeng for RMB5,000,000 ($748,750). On June 30, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement for Equity Transfer
and Capital Increase and Supplementary Agreements with Yipeng and the shareholders (collectively, the  Equity Purchase Agreement ). 

Pursuant to the terms of the
Equity Purchase Agreement, the Company will purchase up to 50% of Yipeng s equity on two dates: (1) on August 10, 2016, in
addition to the existing 5% shares of Yipeng, the Company agreed to pay approximately $2.2 million in cash and transfer equipment
worth approximately $6.8 million in exchange for the purchase of 30.4% of the shares of Yipeng, and (2) prior to November 5, 2016,
provided that Yipeng has been approved to be listed in the catalogue of Industrial Standards of Auto Mobile Power Battery Cell
(the  Catalogue ) prior to October 31, 2016, the Company will pay approximately $3.0 million in cash and transfer equipment
worth approximately $5.2 million in exchange for an additional 14.6% of the shares of Yipeng. The Company also has the right to
purchase in the future an additional 1% of the shares from Yipeng s founding shareholders at a price of approximately $0.4
million which would result in an aggregate ownership of 51% of Yipeng. 

On August 10, 2016, the Company
consummated the first closing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has
invested an aggregate of $9.7 million in exchange for 35.4% of the equity interest of Yipeng, which was recorded under equity method. 

Yipeng failed to be listed in
the Catalogue prior to October 31, 2016 because the PRC government did not assess any new xEV cell and system manufacturers as
originally expected in September. As a result, the Company postponed the second capital injection until Yipeng is listed in the
Catalogue. 

The equity in earnings of investee
was $218,903 for the nine and three months ended September 30, 2016. No impairment was recorded for the long-term investment as
of September 30, 2016. 

The Company and its subsidiaries
file tax returns separately. 

1) VAT 

Pursuant to the Provisional Regulation
of the PRC on VAT and the related implementing rules, all entities and individuals ( taxpayers ) that are engaged in
the sale of products in the PRC are generally required to pay VAT at a rate of 17% of the gross sales proceeds received, less any
deductible VAT already paid or borne by the taxpayers. Further, when exporting goods, the exporter is entitled to a portion of
or all the refund of VAT that it has already paid or incurred. The Company s PRC subsidiaries are subject to VAT at 17% of
their revenues.

7.    Taxation (continued)    

2) Income tax 

United States 

Highpower was incorporated in
Delaware and is subject to U.S. federal income tax with a system of graduated tax rates ranging from 15% to 35%. As Highpower does
not conduct any business in the U.S., it is not subject to U.S. federal income tax or Delaware franchise tax. No deferred U.S.
taxes are recorded since all accumulated profits in the PRC will be permanently reinvested in the PRC. 

Hong Kong 

HKHTC, which is incorporated
in Hong Kong, is subject to a corporate income tax rate of 16.5%. 

PRC 

In accordance with the relevant
tax laws and regulations of the PRC, a company registered in the PRC is subject to income taxes within the PRC at the applicable
tax rate on taxable income. 

In China, the companies granted
with National High-tech Enterprise ( NHTE ) status enjoy 15% income tax rate. This status needs to be renewed every
three years. If these subsidiaries fail to renew NHTE status, they will be subject to income tax at a rate of 25% after the expiration
of NHTE status. 

All the PRC subsidiaries received
NHTE status and enjoy 15% income tax rate for calendar year 2016 and 2015.

7.    Taxation (continued)    

3) Deferred tax assets 

Deferred tax assets and deferred
tax liabilities reflect the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purpose and the tax bases used for income tax purpose. The following represents the tax effect of each major type of
temporary difference. 

The deferred tax assets arising from net operating
losses will expire from 2018 through 2021 if not utilized. 

Valuation allowance was provided
against deferred tax assets in entities where it was determined it was more likely than not that the benefits of the deferred tax
assets will not be realized. The Company had deferred tax assets which consisted of tax loss carry-forwards and others, which can
be carried forward to offset future taxable income. The management determines it is more likely than not that part of deferred
tax assets could not be utilized, so allowance was provided as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

8.    Notes payable    

Notes payable presented to certain
suppliers as a payment against the outstanding trade payables. 

Notes payable are mainly bank
acceptance bills which are non-interest bearing and generally mature within six months. The outstanding bank acceptance bills are
secured by restricted cash deposited in banks. Outstanding bank acceptance bills were $32,048,210 and $30,379,170 as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, the outstanding trade acceptances to suppliers were $nil and $110,996, respectively. These trade acceptances
were non-interest bearing and mature within one year. No security deposit is needed.

Overview  

Highpower was incorporated in the state
of Delaware on January 3, 2006 and was originally organized as a  blank check  shell company to investigate and acquire
a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. On November 2, 2007, we closed
a share exchange transaction, pursuant to which we (i) became the 100% parent of HKHTC and its wholly-owned subsidiary, SZ Highpower,
(ii) assumed the operations of HKHTC and its subsidiary and (iii) changed our name to Hong Kong Highpower Technology, Inc. We subsequently
changed our name to Highpower International, Inc. in October 2010. 

HKHTC was incorporated in Hong Kong in
2003 under the Companies Ordinance of Hong Kong. HKHTC formed HZ Highpower and SZ Springpower in 2008.HZ Highpower was dissolved
in 2015. On October 8, 2013, SZ Springpower further increased its registered capital to $15,000,000. SZ Highpower holds 69.97%
of the equity interest of SZ Springpower, and HKHTC holds the remaining 30.03%. In February 2011, HKHTC formed another wholly-owned
subsidiary, Icon Energy System Company Limited, a company organized under the laws of the PRC, which commenced operations in July
2011. 

On May 15, 2013, GZ Highpower increased
its paid-in capital from RMB15,000,000 ($2,381,293) to RMB30,000,000 ($4,807,847). On November 13, 2014, GZ Highpower increased
its paid-in capital from RMB30,000,000 ($4,898,119) to RMB40,000,000 ($6,530,825) and the additional capital of RMB10,000,000 was
contributed by SZ Highpower. As of September 30, 2016, SZ Highpower holds 70% of the equity interest of GZ Highpower, and four
individuals hold the remaining 30%. 

Through SZ Highpower, we manufacture Nickel
Metal Hydride ( Ni-MH ) batteries for both consumer and industrial applications. We have developed significant expertise
in Ni-MH battery technology and large-scale manufacturing that enables us to improve the quality of our battery products, reduce
costs, and keep pace with evolving industry standards. In 2008, we commenced manufacturing two lines of Lithium-Ion ( Li-ion )
and Lithium polymer rechargeable batteries through SZ Springpower for higher-end, high-performance applications, such as laptops,
digital cameras and wireless communication products. In March 2012, SZ Highpower formed a wholly-owned subsidiary HZ HTC. In March
2015, HZ HTC increased its paid-in capital to RMB60,000,000 ($9,496,526). Through HZ HTC, we manufacture Lithium batteries that
consist of xEV batteries, polymer rechargeable batteries and cylindrical batteries. Our automated machinery allows us to process
key aspects of the manufacturing process to ensure high uniformity and precision, while leaving the non-key aspects of the manufacturing
process to manual labor. 

On August 30, 2016, HKHTC entered into
a non-binding Cooperation Framework Agreement (the  Framework Agreement ) with Anshan Co-operation (Group) Co., Ltd.
( ACOC ) under which ACOC proposed to purchase newly issued shares of SZ Highpower, SZ Springpower and ICON for RMB540
million (approximately $81.0 million), which would be paid directly to the subsidiaries. As a result of its purchase, ACOC would
hold more than 50% in each PRC subsidiary. The Framework Agreement includes a 90 day exclusivity provision and supersedes the non-binding
proposal from ACOC received by the Company on November 27, 2015. In 2015, after receiving the original non-binding proposal, the
Company's Board of Directors formed a special committee consisting of the following independent directors to consider the proposed
transaction: Ping Li, who serves as chairman, Xinhai Li and T. Joseph Fisher, III. The special committee retained independent legal
and financial advisors to assist it in the process. The special committee is continuing to review the proposed transaction. 

We employ a broad network of sales staff
in China and Hong Kong, which target key customers by arranging in-person sales presentations and providing post-sale services.
The sales staff works with our customers to better address customers  needs.

Results of Operations  

The following table sets forth the unaudited
consolidated statements of operations of the Company for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, both in dollars
and as a percentage of net sales. 

Consolidated Statements of Operations  

  (in thousands except share and per share
information)  

Three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Net sales  

We generate revenues from the sale of our Lithium batteries,
Ni-MH batteries and new materials for three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Revenues by segment were as follows (in thousands): 

Net sales for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were $54.1 million compared to $37.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $16.5 million,
or 44.2%. The increase was mainly due to a $17.6 million increase in net sales of our Lithium batteries (resulting from a 129.4%
increase in the volume, measured in ampere hour, of batteries sold and a 11.3% decrease in the average selling price of such batteries). 

Cost of sales  

Cost of sales mainly consists of nickel,
cobalt, lithium derived materials, labor, and overhead. Costs of sales were $40.5 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016, as compared to $30.3 million for the comparable period in 2015. The increase was mainly due to the increase in net sales
of our Lithium batteries. 

Gross profit  

Gross profit for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $13.7 million, or 25.2% of net sales, compared to $7.2 million, or 19.2% of net sales for the comparable
period in 2015. Management considers gross profit margin a key performance indicator in managing our business. Gross profit margins
are usually a factor of cost of sales, product mix and demand for product. This increase was attributed to the increase in volume
of sales of our Lithium batteries, the reduction in the material purchase cost for the Lithium and Ni-MH Batteries, and improvement
in our labor efficiency. 

To cope with pressure on our gross margins
we control production costs by preparing budgets for each department and comparing actual costs with our budgeted figures monthly
and quarterly. Additionally, we have reorganized the Company s production structure and have focused more attention on employee
training to enhance efficiency. 

Research and development  

Research and development expenses were
$3.0 million, or 5.6% of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $2.0 million, or 5.2% of net
sales for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to the increase of technology input on Lithium batteries. 

Selling and distribution expenses  

Selling and distribution expenses were
$1.9 million, or 3.5% of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.7 million, or 4.6% of net sales,
for the comparable period in 2015. 

General and administrative expenses  

General and administrative expenses were
$5.9 million, or 11.0% of net sales, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.3 million, or 8.8% of net sales,
for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to a one-time expense of $1.7 from the allowance for doubtful
accounts. 

Foreign currency transaction   gain  

We experienced a gain of $0.1 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and a gain of $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 on the exchange
rate difference between the U.S. Dollar and the RMB. The gain in exchange rate difference was due to the influence of the RMB relative
to the U.S. Dollar over the respective periods. 

Interest expenses  

Interest expenses were $0.3 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0.2 million for the comparable period in 2015. The increase was mainly
due to the increase of non-financial borrowings. 

Other income  

Other income, which consists of bank interest
income, government grants and sundry income, was approximately $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to approximately $0.2 million for the comparable period in 2015, an increase of $0.3 million. The increase was mainly due to the
increase of income from government subsidies. 

Investment income  

Investment income, which represents a gain
from a related party (Yipeng), was approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Change in fair value change of warrant
liabilities  

Change in fair value change of warrant
liabilities was a loss of $11,150 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to a gain of $0.5 million, for the
comparable period in 2015. It represented the fair value change of 500,000 shares of warrants issued on April 17, 2014. 

Income tax expense  

During the three months ended September
30, 2016, we recorded provision for income tax expense of $0.8 million as compared to income tax expense of $0.3 million for the
comparable period in 2015. 

Net income  

Net income attributable to the Company
(excluding net loss attributable to non-controlling interest) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2.7, compared
to net income attributable to the Company (excluding net loss attributable to non-controlling interest) of $1.9 million for the
comparable period in 2015. 

Nine months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Net sales   

We generate revenues from the sale of our Lithium batteries,
Ni-MH batteries and new materials. Revenues by segment were as follows (in thousands): 

Net sales for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 were $120.0 million compared to $108.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $11.7 million,
or 10.7%. The increase was due to a $17.7 million increase in net sales of our Lithium batteries (resulting from a 62.0% increase
in the volume and a18.7% decrease in the average selling price of such batteries). 

Cost of sales  

Cost of sales mainly consists of nickel,
cobalt, lithium derived materials, labor, and overhead. Costs of sales were $92.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, as compared to $87.0 million for the comparable period in 2015. The increase was due to the increase in net sales of our
Lithium batteries. 

Gross profit  

Gross profit for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $27.2 million, or 22.7% of net sales, compared to $21.3 million, or 19.7% of net sales for the comparable
period in 2015. Management considers gross profit margin a key performance indicator in managing our business. Gross profit margins
are usually a factor of cost of sales, product mix and demand for product. This increase was attributed to an increase in sales
volume of our Lithium batteries, the reduction in the material purchase cost for the Lithium and Ni-MH Batteries, and improvement
in our labor efficiency. 

To cope with pressure on our gross margins
we control production costs by preparing budgets for each department and comparing actual costs with our budgeted figures monthly
and quarterly. Additionally, we have reorganized the Company s production structure and have focused more attention on employee
training to enhance efficiency. 

Research and development  

Research and development expenses were
approximately $6.7 million, or 5.6% of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $5.6
million, or 5.2% of net sales, for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to the increase of technology
input on Lithium batteries. 

Selling and distribution expenses  

Selling and distribution expenses were
$5.0 million, or 4.1% of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.1 million, or 4.7% of net sales,
for the comparable period in 2015. 

General and administrative expenses  

General and administrative expenses were
$12.3 million, or 10.2% of net sales, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $9.7 million, or 9.0% of net sales,
for the comparable period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to a one-time expense of $1.7 million from the allowance for
doubtful accounts. 

Foreign currency transaction gain  

We experienced a gain of $0.6 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and a gain of $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 on the exchange
rate difference between the U.S. Dollar and the RMB. The gain in exchange rate difference was due to the depreciation of the RMB
relative to the U.S. Dollar over the respective periods. 

Interest expenses  

Interest expenses were $1.1 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0.8 million for the comparable period in 2015. The increase in interest
expense was due to an increase in borrowing. 

Other income  

Other income, which consists of bank interest
income, government grants and sundry income, was approximately $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to approximately $0.7 million for the comparable period in 2015. The increase was mainly due to an increase of $1.1 million income
from government subsidiary. 

Investment income  

Investment income, which represents a gain
from a related party (Yipeng), was approximately $0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Gain on fair value change of warrant
liabilities  

Gain on fair value change of warrant liabilities
was $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0.9 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. It represented the fair value change of 500,000 shares of warrants issued on April 17, 2014. 

Income tax expense  

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we recorded provision for income tax expense of $1.0 million as compared to income tax expense of $0.2 million for the
comparable period in 2015. 

Net income   

Net income attributable to the Company
(excluding net loss attributable to non-controlling interest) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.4 million, compared
to net income attributable to the Company (excluding net loss attributable to non-controlling interest) of $3.7 million for the
comparable period in 2015. 

Foreign Currency and Exchange Risk  

Though the reporting currency is the U.S.
Dollar, the Company maintains its financial records in the functional currency of Renminbi ( RMB ). Substantially all
of our operations are conducted in the PRC and we pay the majority of our expenses in RMB. Approximately 43.0% of our sales are
made in U.S. Dollars. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the exchange rate of the RMB to the U.S. Dollar devaluated
2.7% from the level at the end of December 31, 2015. Appreciation of the RMB against the U.S. Dollar would increase our costs when
translated into U.S. Dollars and could adversely affect our margins unless we make sufficient offsetting sales. Exchange rate fluctuations
may also affect the value, in U.S. Dollar terms, of our net assets. In addition, the RMB is not freely convertible into foreign
currency and all foreign exchange transactions must take place through authorized institutions. Due to the volatility of the US
Dollar to our functional currency the Company put into place a hedging program to attempt to protect it from significant changes
to the US Dollar which affects the value of its US dollar receivables and sales. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

We had cash of approximately $13.5 million
as of September 30, 2016, as compared to $5.8 million as of December 31, 2015. Our funds are kept in financial institutions located
in the PRC, which do not provide insurance for amounts on deposit. Moreover, we are subject to the regulations of the PRC which
restrict the transfer of cash from the PRC, except under certain specific circumstances. Accordingly, such funds may not be readily
available to us to satisfy obligations incurred outside the PRC. 

To provide liquidity and flexibility in
funding our operations, we borrowed funds under bank facilities and other external sources of financing. As of September 30, 2016,
we had lines of credit with 6 financial institutions aggregating $57.9 million. The maturity of these facilities is generally from
one year to three years. The facilities are subject to regular review and approval. Certain of these banking facilities are guaranteed
by our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Dang Yu Pan, pledged by land use right and buildings, and contain customary affirmative and
negative covenants for secured credit facilities of this type. Interest rates are generally based on the banks  reference
lending rates. No significant commitment fees are required to be paid for the banking facilities. As of September 30, 2016, we
had utilized approximately $40.0 million under such general credit facilities and had available unused credit facilities of $17.9
million. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, net cash provided by operating activities was approximately $7.2 million, as compared to $6.1 million used in operating activities
for the comparable period in 2015. The net cash increase of $13.3 million provided by operating activities is primarily attributable
to, among other items, an increase of $18.0 million in cash inflow from accounts payable, an increase of $8.9 million in outflow
from accounts receivable and an increase of $2.8 million in inflow from other payables. 

Net cash used in investing activities was
$11.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7.3 million for the comparable period in 2015. The net
increase of $4.2 million of cash used in investing activities was attributable to an increase of $3.0 million in cash outflow from
payment for long-term investment and an increase of $1.1 million in cash outflow from acquisition of plant and equipment. 

Net cash provided by financing activities
was $13.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $7.2 million provided by financing activities
for the comparable period in 2015. The net increase of $6.1 million in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily
attributable to an increase of $6.9 million in proceeds from short-term bank loans and an increase of $4.6 million in proceeds
from non-financial institution borrowing, a decrease of $7.4 million in proceeds from notes payable, a decrease of $4.1 million
in repayment of notes payable, and a decrease of $1.9 million in change in restricted cash. 

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, our inventory turnover was 6.1 times and 5.2 times, respectively. The average days outstanding of our accounts receivable
at September 30, 2016 was 94 days, as compared to 85 days at September 30, 2015. Inventory turnover and average days outstanding
of accounts receivable are key operating measures that management relies on to monitor our business. 

In the next 12 months, we expect to expand
our research, development and manufacturing capacity of lithium-based batteries and we anticipate additional capital expenditures.
Currently our lithium batteries production capacity has been almost full, which limited our ambition to meet increasing demand
from lithium market. Considering the current debt ratio, it is not easy to get sufficient debt loan to support our production capacity
expansion blueprint. That s the main reason that we are now focus on equity financing to support the company long term development. 

The use of working capital is primarily
for the maintenance of our accounts receivable and inventory. We provide our major customers with payment terms ranging from 30
to 90 days. Additionally, our production lead time is approximately 30 to 40 days, from the inspection of incoming materials, to
production, testing and packaging. We need to keep a large supply of raw materials, work-in-process and finished goods inventory
on hand to ensure timely delivery of our products to customers. We use two methods to support our working capital needs: (i) paying
our suppliers under payment terms ranging from 60 to 120 days; and (ii) using short-term bank loans. Upon receiving payment for
our accounts receivable, we pay our short-term loans. Our working capital management practices are designed to ensure that we maintain
sufficient working capital.
