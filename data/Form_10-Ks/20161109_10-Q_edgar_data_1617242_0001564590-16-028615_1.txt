KEARNY FINANCIAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES   
      NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Unaudited)   
   
  1.     PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION   
 The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Kearny Financial Corp. (the  Company ), its wholly-owned subsidiary, Kearny Bank (the  Bank ) and the Bank s wholly-owned subsidiaries, CJB Investment Corp. and KFS Financial Services, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, KFS Insurance Services, Inc. The Company conducts its business principally through the Bank. Management prepared the unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ), including the elimination of all significant inter-company accounts and transactions during consolidation.  

2.     BASIS OF PRESENTATION   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X and do not include information or footnotes necessary for a complete presentation of financial condition, income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders  equity and cash flows in conformity with GAAP. However, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the unaudited consolidated financial statements have been included. The results of operations for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire fiscal year or any other period.  
 The data in the consolidated statement of financial condition for June 30, 2016 was derived from the Company s 2016 annual report on Form 10-K. That data, along with the interim unaudited financial information presented in the consolidated statements of financial condition, income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders  equity and cash flows should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, including the notes thereto, included in the Company s 2016 annual report on Form 10-K.  

3.     NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE ( EPS )   
 Basic EPS is based on the weighted average number of common shares actually outstanding including restricted stock awards adjusted for Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ) shares not yet committed to be released. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock, such as outstanding stock options, were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the Company. Diluted EPS is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding to include the effect of contracts or securities exercisable or which could be converted into common stock, if dilutive, using the treasury stock method. Shares issued and reacquired during any period are weighted for the portion of the period they were outstanding.  
 The following is a reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:  

- 9 - 

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, there were no options which were considered anti-dilutive.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, the average number of options which were considered anti-dilutive totaled approximately 276,080.  

4.     SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   
 The Company has evaluated events and transactions occurring subsequent to the statement of financial condition date of September 30, 2016, for items that should potentially be recognized or disclosed in these consolidated financial statements.  The evaluation was conducted through the date this document was filed. 

5.     PLAN OF CONVERSION AND STOCK OFFERING   
 On May 18, 2015, the Company completed its second-step conversion and stock offering as outlined in the Plan of Conversion and Reorganization (the  Plan ). Pursuant to the Plan, Kearny MHC converted from the mutual holding company form of organization to the fully public form. Kearny MHC was merged into the prior holding company and no longer exists. The prior holding company was then merged into a new Maryland corporation, also named Kearny Financial Corp., which became the holding company for the Bank. 
 In conjunction with that transaction, the Company sold 71,750,000 shares of its common stock at $10.00 per share, resulting in gross proceeds of $717.5 million.  The new shares issued included 3,612,500 shares sold to the Bank s Employee Stock Ownership Plan ( ESOP ) with an aggregate value of $36.1 million based on the sales price of $10.00 per share.  Concurrent with the closing of the transaction, the Company also issued an additional 500,000 shares of its common stock with an aggregate value of $5.0 million and contributed these shares with an additional $5.0 million in cash to the newly established KearnyBank Foundation. 
 The Company recognized direct stock offering costs of approximately $10.7 million in conjunction with the transaction which reduced the net proceeds credited to capital.  After adjusting for transaction costs and the value of the shares issued to the Bank s ESOP, the Company recognized a net increase in equity capital of approximately $670.7 million, of which approximately $353.4 million was contributed to the Bank by the Company as an additional investment in the Bank s common equity. 
 The outstanding shares held by the Company s public stockholders immediately prior to the closing of the conversion and stock offering were  exchanged  or converted into 1.3804 shares of the Company s new common stock.  All shares previously held by Kearny MHC, the former mutual holding company, as well as the remaining shares previously repurchased by the Company and held in treasury were cancelled concurrent with the closing of the transaction. 

6.     RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued  ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) .  The ASU s core principle is built on the contract between a vendor and a customer for the provision of goods and services. It attempts to depict the exchange of rights and obligations between the parties in the pattern of revenue recognition based on the consideration to which the vendor is entitled. To accomplish this objective, the standard requires five basic steps: i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. For public entities, the  
 - 10 - 

guidance is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the impac  t of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.  
 In June 2014, the FASB issued  ASU 2014-11, Transfers and Servicing (Topic 860) Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures . The purpose of the ASU is to address the concern that current accounting guidance distinguishes between repurchase agreements that settle at the same time as the maturity of the transferred financial asset and those that settle any time before maturity. In particular, repurchase-to-maturity transactions are generally accounted for as sales with forward agreements under current accounting, whereas typical repurchase agreements that settle before the maturity of the transferred financial asset are accounted for as secured borrowings. Additionally, current accounting guidance requires an evaluation of whether an initial transfer of a financial asset and a contemporaneous repurchase agreement (a repurchase financing) should be accounted for separately or linked. If linked, the arrangement is accounted for on a combined basis as a forward agreement. Those outcomes often are referred to as off-balance-sheet accounting. The ASU changes the accounting for repurchase-to-maturity transactions and linked repurchase financings to secured borrowing accounting, which is consistent with the accounting for other repurchase agreements. The amendments also require two new related disclosures. The Company adopted this ASU effective July 1, 2015 and its adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2014, the FASB issued  ASU 2014-14, Receivables   Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40): Classification of Certain Government-Guaranteed Mortgage Loans upon Foreclosure .  The purpose of the ASU is to address a practice issue related to the classification of certain foreclosed residential and nonresidential mortgage loans that are either fully or partially guaranteed under government programs. Specifically, creditors should reclassify loans that meet certain conditions to "other receivables" upon foreclosure, rather than reclassifying them to other real estate owned (OREO). The separate other receivable recorded upon foreclosure is to be measured based on the amount of the loan balance (principal and interest) the creditor expects to recover from the guarantor.  The Company adopted this ASU effective July 1, 2015 and its adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In August 2015, the FASB issued  ASU 2015-15, Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements (Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting) .  The purpose of the ASU is to codify an SEC staff announcement that entities are permitted to defer and present debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as assets.  Given the absence of authoritative guidance within Update 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements, ASU 2015-15 clarifies that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  The ASU was immediately effective upon its announcement and its adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In September 2015, the FASB issued  ASU 2015-16, Business Combination (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments .  The ASU requires adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  This includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. 
 In addition, the amendments in the ASU would require an entity to disclose (either on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the nature and amount of measurement-period adjustments recognized in the current period, including separately the amounts in current-period income statement line items that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date.  The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 and its adoption did not have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
 In January 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities .  The ASU requires an entity to: (i) measure equity investments at fair value through net income, with certain exceptions; (ii) present in OCI the changes in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities measured using the fair value option; (iii) present financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset; (iv) calculate the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes based on an exit price and; (v) assess a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to unrealized losses of AFS debt securities in combination with other deferred tax assets. The Update provides an election to subsequently measure certain nonmarketable equity investments at cost less any impairment and adjusted for certain observable price changes. The Update also requires a qualitative impairment assessment of such equity investments and amends certain fair value disclosure requirements. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
 - 11 - 

In February 2016, the FASB issued   ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic   842)  .  The ASU applies a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a liability to make lease payments. For leases wit  h a term of 12 months or less, a practical expedient is available whereby a lessee may elect, by class of underlying asset, not to recognize an ROU asset or lease liability. At inception, lessees must classify all leases as either finance or operating base  d on five criteria. Balance sheet recognition of finance and operating leases is similar, but the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement, as well as the effect on the statement of cash flows, differs depending on the lease classification.  
 The new leases standard requires a lessor to classify leases as either sales-type, direct financing or operating, similar to existing U.S. GAAP. Classification depends on the same five criteria used by lessees plus certain additional factors. The subsequent accounting treatment for all three lease types is substantially equivalent to existing U.S. GAAP for sales-type leases, direct financing leases, and operating leases. However, the new standard updates certain aspects of the lessor accounting model to align it with the new lessee accounting model, as well as with the new revenue standard under Topic 606. 
 Lessees and lessors are required to provide certain qualitative and quantitative disclosures to enable users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The new leases standard addresses other considerations including identification of a lease, separating lease and non-lease components of a contract, sale and leaseback transactions, modifications, combining contracts, reassessment of the lease term, and re-measurement of lease payments. It also contains comprehensive implementation guidance with practical examples.. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-05, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships .  The ASU requires an entity to discontinue a designated hedging relationship in certain circumstances, including termination of the derivative hedging instrument or if the entity wishes to change any of the critical terms of the hedging relationship. ASU 2016-05 amends Topic 815 to clarify that novation of a derivative (replacing one of the parties to a derivative instrument with a new party) designated as the hedging instrument would not, in and of itself, be considered a termination of the derivative instrument or a change in critical terms requiring discontinuation of the designated hedging relationship.  For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-06, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments .  The ASU addresses how an entity should assess whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. This assessment is necessary to determine if the option(s) must be separately accounted for as a derivative. The ASU clarifies that an entity is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with a specific four-step decision sequence. This means entities are not also required to assess whether the contingency for exercising the option(s) is indexed to interest rates or credit risk. For example, when evaluating debt instruments puttable upon a change in control, the event triggering the change in control is not relevant to the assessment. Only the resulting settlement of debt is subject to the four-step decision sequence.  For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting .  The ASU introduces targeted amendments intended to simplify the accounting for stock compensation.  Specifically, the ASU requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur. An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. That is, off balance sheet accounting for net operating losses stemming from excess tax benefits would no longer be required and instead such net operating losses would be recognized when they arise. Existing net operating losses that are currently tracked off balance sheet would be recognized, net of a valuation allowance if required, through an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption. Entities will no longer need to maintain and track an  APIC pool.  The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows. 
 In addition, the ASU elevates the statutory tax withholding threshold to qualify for equity classification up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction(s). The ASU also clarifies that cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. 
 - 12 - 

The ASU provides an optional accounting policy electi  on (with limited exceptions), to be applied on an entity-wide basis, to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest (consistent with existing U.S. GAAP) or account for forfeitures when they occur.  
 For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In April 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing .  The amendments in ASU 2016-10 provide more detailed guidance, including additional implementation guidance and examples for identifying performance obligations and revenue recognition for licenses of intellectual property.  
 The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-10 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Topic 606 which, for public entities, is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In May 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting .  ASU 2016-11 codifies the SEC s rescission of certain SEC Staff Observer comments that were codified in Topic 605 and Topic 932.  In addition, the ASU codifies SEC s rescission of SEC Staff Announcement,  Determining the Nature of a Host Contract Related to a Hybrid Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share under Topic 815,  which was previously codified in paragraph 815-10-S99-3. 
 The amendments within Topics 605 and 932 are effective upon adoption of Topic 606 which, for public entities, is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.  Paragraph 815-10-S99-3 is rescinded to coincide with the effective date of Update 2014-16.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In May 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients .  The amendments do not alter the core principle of the new revenue standard, but make certain targeted changes to clarify the following topics: assessing collectability, presenting sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers, non-cash consideration, contract modifications and transition, completed contracts at transition and disclosing the accounting change in the period of adoption. 
 The effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-12 are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Topic 606 which, for public entities, is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued  ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instrument .  The ASU requires credit losses on most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments to be measured using an expected credit loss model (referred to as the current expected credit loss (CECL) model). Under this model, entities will estimate credit losses over the entire contractual term of the instrument (considering estimated prepayments, but not expected extensions or modifications unless reasonable expectation of a troubled debt restructuring exists) from the date of initial recognition of that instrument.  
 The ASU also replaces the current accounting model for purchased credit impaired loans and debt securities. The allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ( PCD assets ), should be determined in a similar manner to other financial assets measured on an amortized cost basis. However, upon initial recognition, the allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price ( gross up approach ) to determine the initial amortized cost basis. The subsequent accounting for PCD financial assets is the same expected loss model described above. 
 Further, the ASU made certain targeted amendments to the existing impairment model for available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities. For an AFS debt security for which there is neither the intent nor a more-likely-than-not requirement to sell, an entity will record credit losses as an allowance rather than a write-down of the amortized cost basis. 
 For public business entities that are SEC filers, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements.

On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230), a consensus of the FAS  B s Emerging Issues Task Force.  The new guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  The new guidance addresses eight classification issues related to the statement of cas  h flows, which include proceeds from settlement of corporate-owned and bank-owned life insurance policies.  For a public entity, ASU 2016-15 is   effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal year  s.    The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this ASU on its consolidated financial statements  .  

7.     SECURITIES AVAILABLE FOR SALE   
 The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair values of debt and mortgage-backed securities available for sale at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and stratification by contractual maturity of debt securities available for sale at September 30, 2016 are presented below: 

- 14 - 

There were no sales of securities available for sale during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30 2015.  
 At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, securities available for sale with carrying values of approximately $41.9 million and $45.0 million, respectively, were utilized as collateral for borrowings through the FHLB of New York. As of those same dates, securities available for sale with total carrying values of approximately $944,000 and $983,000, respectively, were pledged to secure public funds on deposit.

8.     SECURITIES HELD TO MATURITY     
 The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and fair values of debt and mortgage-backed securities held to maturity at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and stratification by contractual maturity of debt securities held to maturity at September 30, 2016 are presented below:  

- 16 - 

There were no sales of securities held to maturity during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 
 At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, securities held to maturity with carrying values of approximately $121.8 million and $148.8 million, respectively, were utilized as collateral for borrowings from the FHLB of New York. As of those same dates, securities held to maturity with total carrying values of approximately $7.2 million and $7.5 million, respectively, were pledged to secure public funds on deposit.

9.     IMPAIRMENT OF SECURITIES   
 The following two tables summarize the fair values and gross unrealized losses within the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016. The gross unrealized losses, presented by security type, represent temporary impairments of value within each portfolio as of the dates presented. Temporary impairments within the available for sale portfolio have been recognized through other comprehensive income as reductions in stockholders  equity on a tax-effected basis.  
 The tables are followed by a discussion that summarizes the Company s rationale for recognizing impairments, where applicable, as  temporary  versus those identified as  other-than-temporary . Such rationale is presented by investment type and generally applies consistently to both the  available for sale  and  held to maturity  portfolios, except where specifically noted.  

- 18 - 

The number of available for sale securities with unrealized losses at September 30,   2016 totaled 53 and included five U.S. agency securities, eight asset-backed securities, 17 collateralized loan obligations, nine corporate obligations, four trust preferred securities, five collateralized mortgage obligations and five residential pass-thr  ough securities. The number of available for sale securities with unrealized losses at June 30, 2016 totaled 52 and included five U.S. agency securities, eight asset-backed securities, 18 collateralized loan obligations, 14 corporate obligations, four trus  t preferred securities and   three   collateralized mortgage obligations.     

The number of held to maturity securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 totaled 15 and included two U.S. agency securities, seven municipal obligations, five collateralized mortgage obligations and one residential pass-through security.  The number of held to maturity securities with unrealized losses at June 30, 2016 totaled 13 and included one U.S. agency security, seven municipal obligations, four collateralized mortgage obligations, and one residential pass-through security.  
 In general, if the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost basis at the time of evaluation, the security is  impaired  and the impairment is to be evaluated to determine if it is other than temporary.  The Company evaluates the impaired securities in its portfolio for possible other than temporary impairment (OTTI) on at least a quarterly basis.  The following represents the circumstances under which an impaired security is determined to be other than temporarily impaired: 

When the Company intends to sell the impaired debt security;     

When the Company more likely than not will be required to sell the impaired debt security before recovery of its amortized cost (for example, whether liquidity requirements or contractual or regulatory obligations indicate that the security will be required to be sold before a forecasted recovery occurs); or     

When an impaired debt security does not meet either of the two conditions above, but the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security.  According to applicable accounting guidance for debt securities, this is generally when the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the security.     

 In the first two circumstances noted above, the amount of OTTI recognized in earnings is the entire difference between the security s amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date.  In the third circumstance, however, the OTTI is to be separated into the amount representing the credit loss from the amount related to all other factors.  The credit loss component is to be recognized in earnings while the non-credit loss component is to be recognized in other comprehensive income.  In these cases, OTTI  
 - 19 - 

is generally predicated on an adverse change in cash flows (e.g. principal and/or interest payment deferrals or losses) versus tho  se expected at the time of purchase.  The absence of an adverse change in expected cash flows generally indicates that a security s impairment is related to other  non-credit loss  factors and is thereby generally not recognized as OTTI.  
 The Company considers a variety of factors when determining whether a credit loss exists for an impaired security including, but not limited to: 

The length of time and the extent (a percentage) to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost basis;     

Adverse conditions specifically related to the security, an industry, or a geographic area (e.g. changes in the financial condition of the issuer of the security, or in the case of an asset backed debt security, in the financial condition of the underlying loan obligors, including changes in technology or the discontinuance of a segment of the business that may affect the future earnings potential of the issuer or underlying loan obligors of the security or changes in the quality of the credit enhancement);     

The historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security;     

The payment structure of the debt security;     

Actual or expected failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments;     

Changes to the rating of the security by external rating agencies; and     

Recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date.     

 At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company held no securities for which credit-related OTTI had been recognized in earnings based on the Company s analysis and determination that the impairment reported in the tables above was  temporary  in nature as of both dates. 
 The rationale for making that determination is based on several factors which are generally shared among the various sectors represented in the Company s available for sale and held to maturity portfolios.  The most significant of these is the general mitigation of credit risk arising from the U.S. government, agency and GSE guarantees supporting the Company s mortgage-backed securities, U.S. agency debt securities and asset-backed securities. 
 While not supported by such guarantees, the Company s collateralized loan obligations represent tranches within a larger investment vehicle that reallocate cash flows and credit risk among the individual tranches comprised within that vehicle.  Through this structure, the Company is afforded significant protection against the risk that the securities within this sector will be adversely impacted by borrowers defaulting on the underlying loans. 
 In the absence of the guarantor or structural protections noted above, the securities within the other sectors of the Company s securities portfolio, including its municipal obligations, corporate bonds and single-issuer trust preferred securities are generally issued by credit-worthy entities with the ability and resources to fully meet their financial obligations.  The Company regularly monitors the historical cash flows and financial strength of all issuers and/or guarantors to confirm that security impairment, where applicable, is not due to an actual or expected adverse change in security cash flows that would result in the recognition of credit-related OTTI. 
 With credit risk being mitigated in the manner outlined above, the unrealized losses on the Company s securities are due largely to the combined effects of several market-related factors including, most notably, changes in market interest rates and changing market conditions which affect the supply and demand for such securities.  Those market conditions may fluctuate over time resulting in certain securities being impaired for periods in excess of 12 months.  However, the longevity of such impairment is not necessarily reflective of an expectation for an adverse change in cash flows signifying a credit loss.  Consequently, the impairments of value resulting directly from these changing market conditions are considered  noncredit-related  and  temporary  in nature. 
 The Company has the stated ability and intent to  hold to maturity  those securities so designated at September 30, 2016  and does not intend to sell the temporarily impaired available for sale securities prior to the recovery of their fair value to a level equal to or greater than the Company s amortized cost.  Furthermore, the Company has concluded that the possibility of being required to sell the securities prior to their anticipated recovery is unlikely based upon its strong liquidity, asset quality and capital position as of that date.  In light of the factors noted, the Company does not consider its balance of securities with unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 to be  other-than-temporarily  impaired as of that date.

10.     LOAN QUALITY AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES   
 Acquired Credit-Impaired Loans.  At September 30, 2016, the remaining outstanding principal balance and carrying amount of acquired credit-impaired loans totaled approximately $1,450,000 and $1,123,000, respectively. By comparison, at June 30, 2016, the remaining outstanding principal balance and carrying amount of acquired credit-impaired loans totaled approximately $1,605,000 and $1,168,000, respectively.   
 The carrying amount of acquired credit-impaired loans for which interest is not being recognized due to the uncertainty of the cash flows relating to such loans totaled $396,000 and $436,000 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  
 The balance of the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2016 included approximately $13,000 of valuation allowances for specifically identified impairment attributable to acquired credit-impaired loans. The valuation allowances were attributable to additional impairment recognized on the applicable loans subsequent to their acquisition, net of any charge offs recognized during that time.  There were no valuation allowances for specifically identified impairment attributable to acquired credit-impaired loans at September 30, 2016. 
 The following table presents the changes in the accretable yield relating to the acquired credit-impaired loans for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.  

Residential Mortgage Loans in Foreclosure.  We may obtain physical possession of one- to four-family real estate collateralizing a residential mortgage loan via foreclosure or through an in-substance repossession. As of September 30, 2016, we held two single-family properties in real estate owned with a carrying value of $150,000 that were acquired through foreclosures on residential mortgage loans.  As of that same date, we held 23 residential mortgage loans with aggregate carrying values totaling $5.4 million which were in the process of foreclosure.

Loan Quality.     The following tables present the balance of the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 based upon the calculation methodology as described in the Company s Form 10-K   for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. The tables identify the valuation allowances attributable to specifically identified impairments on individually evaluated loans, including those acquired with deteriorated credit quality, as well as valuation allow  ances for impairments on loans evaluated collectively. The tables include the underlying balance of loans receivable applicable to each category as of those dates as well as the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the three months ended September   30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Unless otherwise noted, the balance of loans reported in the tables below excludes yield adjustments and the allowance for loan loss.

The manner in which the   terms of a loan are modified through a troubled debt restructuring generally includes one or more of the following changes to the loan s repayment terms:   

Interest Rate Reduction  : Temporary or permanent reduction of the interest rate charged against the outstanding balance of the loan.      

Capitalization of Prior Past Dues  : Capitalization of prior amounts due to the outstanding balance of the loan.      

Extension of Maturity or Balloon Date  : Extending the term of the loan past its original balloon or maturity date.      

Deferral of Principal Payments:   Temporary deferral of the principal portion of a loan payment.      

Payment Recalculation and Re-amortization  : Recalculation of the recurring payment obligation and resulting loan amortization/repayment schedule based on the loan s modified terms.      

11.     BORROWINGS   
 Fixed rate advances from the FHLB of New York mature as follows:  

At September 30, 2016, $450.0 million in advances are due within one year while the remaining $150.8 million in advances are due after one year of which $145.0 million are callable in April 2018.  
 At September 30, 2016, FHLB advances were collateralized by the FHLB capital stock owned by the Bank and mortgage loans and securities with carrying values totaling approximately $1.4 billion and $163.7 million, respectively. At June 30, 2016, FHLB advances were collateralized by the FHLB capital stock owned by the Bank and mortgage loans and securities with carrying values totaling approximately $970.5 million and $193.8 million, respectively.  
 Borrowings at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 also included overnight borrowings in the form of depositor sweep accounts totaling $32.6 million and $35.6 million, respectively. Depositor sweep accounts are short term borrowings representing funds that are withdrawn from a customer s noninterest-bearing deposit account and invested in an uninsured overnight investment account that is collateralized by specified investment securities owned by the Bank.  

12.     DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES   
 At September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company was subject to the terms of certain interest rate derivative agreements that were utilized by the Company to manage the interest rate exposure arising from specific wholesale funding positions. Such wholesale funding sources include floating-rate brokered money market deposits indexed to one-month LIBOR as well as a number of 90 day fixed-rate FHLB advances that are forecasted to be periodically redrawn at maturity for the same 90 day term as the original advance. The derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges with changes in their fair value recorded as an adjustment through other comprehensive income on an after-tax basis.  
 - 31 - 

The effects of derivative instruments on the statements of condition included in the Consolida  ted Financial Statements at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 are as follows:   

- 32 - 

The Company has in place enforceable master netting arrangements with all counterparties. All master netting arrangements include rights to offset associated with the Company s recognized derivative assets, derivative liabilities, and cash collateral received and pledged.  
 - 33 - 

At September 30, 2016, three of the Company s derivatives were in an asset position totaling $1.1 million while the remaining twelve derivatives were in a liability position totaling $15.2 million. In total, the Company s derivatives were   in a net liability position of $14.1 million at September 30, 2016 and included in other liabilities as of that date. As required under the enforceable master netting arrangement with its derivatives counterparties, the Company posted financial collateral   to two counterparties totaling $15.6 million at September 30, 2016 that was not included as an offsetting amount.   
 At June 30, 2016, two of the Company s derivatives were in an asset position totaling $60,000 while the remaining eight derivatives were in a liability position totaling $19.3 million. In total, the Company s derivatives were in a net liability position of $19.3 million at June 30, 2016 and included in other liabilities as of that date. As required under the enforceable master netting arrangement with its derivatives counterparty, the Company posted financial collateral in the amount of $19.7 million at June 30, 2016 that was not included as an offsetting amount. 
 In addition to the derivatives noted above, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans held-for-sale totaling $37.3 million and $16.7 million at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, which are considered free-standing derivative instruments whose fair values are not material to our financial condition or results of operations. 

13.     BENEFIT PLANS   
  Components of Net Periodic Expense   
 The following table sets forth the aggregate net periodic benefit expense for the Bank s Benefit Equalization Plan, Postretirement Welfare Plan, Directors  Consultation and Retirement Plan and Atlas Bank Retirement Income Plan:  

Directors Consultation and Retirement Plan  
 On December 23, 2015, the Company amended its Directors Consultation and Retirement Plan (the  DCRP ) to freeze the DCRP such that no additional DCRP benefits will accrue to any participant after December 31, 2015 and to revise the minimum age requirement for benefit vesting purposes. Accordingly, the benefits payable to participating directors under the DCRP will not increase after December 31, 2015. 

14.     FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   
 The guidance on fair value measurement establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level 1:  

Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level 2:  

Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.  

Level 3:  

Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.  

- 34 - 

In addition, the guidance requires the Company to disclose the fair value for assets and liabilities on both a recurring and non-recurring basis.   
 Those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below:  

- 35 - 

The fair values of securities available for sale (carried at fair value) or held to maturity (carried at amortized cost) are primarily determined by obtaining matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs). 
   
 The Company held one trust preferred security whose fair value of $1.0 million at September 30, 2016 was determined using Level 3 inputs.  By comparison, the security s fair value of $1.0 million at June 30, 2016 had been determined using Level 2 inputs based on the availability of matrix pricing at that time.  Matrix pricing was no longer available for the security at September 30, 2016 requiring the use of Level 3 inputs to determine the fair value of the security as of that date. 
 The Company has contracted with a third party vendor to provide periodic valuations for its interest rate derivatives to determine the fair value of its interest rate caps and swaps. The vendor utilizes standard valuation methodologies applicable to interest rate derivatives such as discounted cash flow analysis and extensions of the Black-Scholes model. Such valuations are based upon readily observable market data and are therefore considered Level 2 valuations by the Company. 
 In addition to the derivative instruments noted above, the Company had outstanding commitments to fund loans held-for sale totaling $37.3 million and $16.7 million at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively, which are considered free-standing derivative instruments, the fair values of which are not material to our financial condition or results of operations.    
   
 - 36 - 

Th  ose assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are summarized below:  

The following table presents additional quantitative information about assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and for which the Company has utilized adjusted Level 3 inputs to determine fair value: 

(1)   
 
 The fair value of impaired loans is generally determined based on an independent appraisal of the market value of a loan s underlying collateral.    

(2)   
 
 The fair value basis of impaired loans and real estate owned is adjusted to reflect management estimates of disposal costs including, but not necessarily limited to, real estate brokerage commissions and title transfer fees, with such cost estimates generally ranging from 6% to 10% of collateral or property market value.    

(3)   
 
 The fair value basis of real estate owned is generally determined based upon the lower of an independent appraisal of the property s market value or the applicable listing price or contracted sales price.

An impaired loan is evaluated and valued at the time the loan is identified as impaired at the lower of cost or market value. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Market value is measured based on the value of the collateral securing the loan and is classified at a Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures impairment in accordance with the FASB s guidance on accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan with the fair value estimated using the market value of the collateral reduced by estimated disposal costs. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceeds the recorded investments in such loans. Impaired loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly.  
 At September 30, 2016, impaired loans valued using Level 3 inputs comprised loans with principal balances totaling $10.4 million and valuation allowances of $168,000 reflecting fair values of $10.2 million. By comparison, at June 30, 2016, impaired loans valued using Level 3 inputs comprised loans with principal balances totaling $11.1 million and valuation allowances of $608,000 reflecting fair values of $10.5 million.  
 Once a loan is foreclosed, the fair value of the real estate owned continues to be evaluated based upon the market value of the repossessed real estate originally securing the loan.  At September 30, 2016, the Company held real estate owned totaling $18,000 whose carrying value was written down utilizing Level 3 inputs during the first three months of fiscal 2017.  At June 30, 2016, the Company held real estate owned totaling $280,000 whose carrying value was written down utilizing Level 3 inputs during fiscal 2016. 
 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016:  
 Cash and Cash Equivalents, Interest Receivable and Interest Payable.  The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, interest receivable and interest payable approximate fair value because they mature in three months or less.   
 Securities.  See the discussion presented above concerning assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis.   
 Loans Receivable.  Except for certain impaired loans as previously discussed, the fair value of loans receivable is estimated by discounting the future cash flows, using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, of such loans.   
 FHLB of New York Stock.  The carrying amount of restricted investment in bank stock approximates fair value, and considers the limited marketability of such securities.   
 Deposits.  The fair value of demand, savings and club accounts is equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of certificates of deposit is estimated using rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. The fair value estimates do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market.   
 Advances from FHLB.  Fair value is estimated using rates currently offered for advances of similar remaining maturities.   
 Interest Rate Derivatives.  See the discussion presented above concerning assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis.   
 Commitments.  The fair value of commitments to fund credit lines and originate or participate in loans is estimated using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed rate loan commitments, fair value also considers the difference between current levels of interest and the committed rates. The carrying value, represented by the net deferred fee arising from the unrecognized commitment, and the fair value, determined by discounting the remaining contractual fee over the term of the commitment using fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements with similar credit risk, is not considered material for disclosure. The contractual amounts of unfunded commitments are presented in Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the heading Liquidity and Capital Resources.

The carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments are as follows:   

- 39 - 

Limitations.  Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instruments. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no market value exists for a significant portion of the financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors. These estimates are subjective in nature, involve uncertainties and matters of judgment and, therefore, cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates.   
 The fair value estimates are based on existing on-and-off balance sheet financial instruments without attempting to value anticipated future business and the value of assets and liabilities that are not considered financial instruments. Other significant assets and liabilities that are not considered financial assets and liabilities include premises and equipment, and advances from borrowers for taxes. In addition, the ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of the estimates.

Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016  
 General.   Total assets increased $23.2 million to $4.52 billion at September 30, 2016 from $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016.  The net increase in total assets reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in balances of securities and cash and cash equivalents.  The net increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a net decrease in stockholders  equity.  
 Cash and Cash Equivalents.   Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of interest-earning and non-interest-earning deposits in other banks, decreased by $126.6 million to $72.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $199.2 million at June 30, 2016.  The variance between periods generally reflected the effects of a temporary accumulation of short-term, liquid assets arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  The Company reinvested a significant portion of that excess liquidity back into the loan portfolio during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  
 Management actively monitors the level of short term, liquid assets in relation to the expected need for such liquidity to fund the Company s strategic initiatives while meeting its performance and risk management objectives.  Where appropriate, the Company may alter its liquidity management strategies based upon those objectives.  The Company generally intends to reduce the average balance of cash and cash equivalents, compared to the average balance maintained during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, to further reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining excess liquidity. 
 Debt Securities Available for Sale.   Debt securities classified as available for sale increased by $2.6 million to $392.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $389.9 million at June 30, 2016. The increase primarily reflected a $2.7 million decrease in the net unrealized loss of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of $9.5 million at September 30, 2016 from a net unrealized loss of $12.2 million at June 30, 2016.  The decrease in the net unrealized loss reflected changes in the fair value of various sectors within the portfolio arising from movements in market interest rates coupled with a tightening of pricing spreads within certain sectors in the portfolio.  The increase in the portfolio attributable to the decrease in the unrealized loss was partially offset by principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $195,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
 The net unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale was primarily reflected within the applicable  credit sectors  of the portfolio which include asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, corporate bonds and non-pooled trust preferred securities.  The net unrealized loss on this subset of securities decreased by $3.0 million to a net unrealized loss of $10.3 million at September 30, 2016 from a net unrealized loss of $13.3 million at June 30, 2016.  The decrease in the unrealized loss largely reflected a general tightening of pricing spreads in the marketplace resulting in an overall increase in the market price of such securities. The effect of such spread tightening was partially offset by the effect of certain credit-rating downgrades on specific securities within the portfolio during the period.  The decrease in the net unrealized loss on the noted securities was partially offset a $159,000 decrease in the unrealized gain on government and agency securities, including U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, to $883,000 from $1.0 million for the same comparative periods.   
 - 43 - 

Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of   September 30  , 2016.    However,   volatility in the financial markets may result in additi  onal decreases in the fair value of the Company s available for sale securities.  Such volatility may impact the fair value of the securities within the  credit sectors  of the portfolio   more adversely than   the Company s government and agency securities.    The   adverse effects of such volatility on the current and prospective financial strength of specific corporate issuers, and the resulting impact on the fair value of the related securities held by the Company, will be carefully monitored by management.  
 Mortgage-backed Securities Available for Sale.   Mortgage-backed securities available for sale increased by $13.1 million to $296.7 million at September 30, 2016 from $283.6 million at June 30, 2016. The net increase reflected security purchases totaling $30.7 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The security purchases were partially offset by cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $16.7 million coupled with a $957,000 decrease in the net unrealized gain on the portfolio to a net unrealized gain of $6.6 million at September 30, 2016 from a net unrealized gain of $7.5 million at June 30, 2016.  
 At September 30, 2016, the available for sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held one non-agency mortgage-backed security within the available for sale portfolio whose aggregate carrying value totaled $119,000.  Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.  
 Additional information regarding securities available for sale at September 30, 2016 is presented in Note 7 and Note 9 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  
 Debt Securities Held to Maturity.   Debt securities classified as held to maturity decreased by $25.1 million to $142.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $167.2 million at June 30, 2016. The net decrease in the portfolio largely reflected principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $25.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The net decrease was partially offset by the purchase of $315,000 in securities during the same period.  
 At September 30, 2016, the held to maturity debt securities portfolio included U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, a small portion of which represent non-rated, short term, bond anticipation notes ( BANs ) issued by New Jersey municipalities.  Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.  
 Mortgage-backed Securities Held to Maturity.   Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity decreased by $13.9 million to $396.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $410.1 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in the portfolio fully reflected cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, during the three months ended September 30, 2016.   
 At September 30, 2016, the held to maturity mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held four non-agency mortgage-backed securities in the held to maturity portfolio whose aggregate carrying value and fair value totaled $30,000 and $29,000, respectively. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.  
 Additional information regarding securities held to maturity at September 30, 2016 is presented in Note 8 and Note 9 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  
 Loans Held-for-Sale.   The Company continues to expand its residential lending infrastructure to support strategies focused on increasing the origination volume of residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market.  The anticipated increase in residential mortgage loan origination and sale activity is expected to increase the Company s level of non-interest income over time through the recognition of additional sources of recurring loan sale gains while serving to help manage the Company s exposure to interest rate risk.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, we sold $17.6 million of residential mortgage loans resulting in net sale gains totaling $112,000 for the period.  Loans held for sale totaled $4.5 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $3.3 million at June 30, 2016 and are reported separately from balance of net loans receivable as of those dates.  
 Loans Receivable.   Loans receivable, net of unamortized premiums, deferred costs and the allowance for loan losses, increased by $170.8 million or 6.4% to $2.82 billion at September 30, 2016 from $2.65 billion at June 30, 2016. The increase in net loans receivable was primarily attributable to new loan origination and purchase volume outpacing loan repayments during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

Residential mortgage loans held in portfolio, including home equity loans and lines of credit, decreased by $24.8 million to $670.0 million at September   30, 2016 from $694.8 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the balance of one-to-four family first mortgage loans of $21.0 million to $584.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $605.2 million at June 30, 2016.    The decrease also reflected an aggregate decrease of $3.8 million in the balance of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit to $85.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $89.6 million at June 30, 2016.    
 Notwithstanding the decrease in their balance during the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company generally intends to modestly increase the outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans held in portfolio while allowing the segment to continue to decline as a percentage of total loans and earning assets.  In total, the origination volume of portfolio residential mortgage loans for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $8.8 million while aggregate originations of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit totaled $3.7 million for that same period.  
 Commercial loans, in aggregate, increased by $197.8 million to $2.15 billion at September 30, 2016 from $1.95 billion at June 30, 2016. The components of the aggregate increase included an increase in commercial mortgage loans totaling $198.7 million that was partially offset by an $874,000 decrease in commercial business loans.  The ending balances of commercial mortgage loans and commercial business loans at September 30, 2016 were $2.06 billion and $87.3 million, respectively. 
 Commercial loan origination volume for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $109.6 million, comprising $104.0 million and $5.8 million of commercial mortgage and commercial business loan originations, respectively. Commercial loan originations were augmented with the purchase of commercial mortgage loans and participations totaling $126.7 million coupled with the purchase of commercial business loans totaling $2.6 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Commercial loan purchases during the three months ended September 30, 2016 were largely funded with the excess liquidity that had accumulated during the prior quarter ended June 30, 2016 due to an increase in loan prepayments. 
 The outstanding balance of construction loans, net of loans-in-process, increased by $21,000 to $2.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $2.0 million at June 30, 2016. Construction loan disbursements for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $30,000.  
 Other loans, primarily comprising account loans, deposit account overdraft lines of credit and other consumer loans, decreased by $2.5 million to $22.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $25.4 million at June 30, 2016.  The balance of other consumer loans at September 30, 2016 included loans with outstanding balances totaling $19.7 million that were acquired through the Company s relationship with Lending Club, an established peer-to-peer (i.e. marketplace) lender.  Through this relationship, the Company has purchased high-quality, unsecured consumer loans originated through Lending Club s online platform.  The Company intends to limit the growth of its Lending Club loan portfolio to a threshold of approximately $25.0 million in aggregate outstanding balances while continuing to independently monitor and validate the performance of the portfolio in relation to Company s expectations as well as those of Lending Club s proprietary credit risk model.  Additional investment in Lending Club loans may be considered by the Company after a sufficient period of time to properly gauge performance of the initial portfolio and quality of loan servicing and reporting rendered by Lending Club. 
 The Company originated $315,000 of consumer loans during the three months ended September 30, 2016 while no additional consumer loans were purchased during the period. 
 Nonperforming Loans.   Nonperforming loans increased by $790,000 to $21.8 million, or 0.77% of total loans at September 30, 2016, from $21.1 million, or 0.79% of total loans at June 30, 2016. Nonperforming generally include loans reported as  accruing loans over 90 days past due  and loans reported as  nonaccrual  with such balances totaling $77,000 and $21.9 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016.  
 Additional information about the Company s nonperforming loans at September 30, 2016 is presented in Note 10 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements.  
 Allowance for Loan Losses.   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased by $774,000 to $25.0 million or 0.88% of total loans at September 30, 2016 from $24.2 million or 0.91% of total loans at June 30, 2016. The increase resulted from provisions of $1.1 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that were partially offset by charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaling $355,000 during that same period.  
 With regard to loans individually evaluated for impairment, the balance of our allowance for loan losses attributable to such loans decreased by $440,000 to $168,000 at September 30, 2016 from $608,000 at June 30, 2016.  The balance at September 30, 2016 reflected the allowance for impairment identified on $1.0 million of impaired loans while an additional $24.6 million of impaired loans had no allowance for impairment as of that date.  By comparison, the balance at June 30, 2016 reflected the allowance for  
 - 45 - 

impairment identified on $  3.2   million of impaired loans while an additional $  21.9   million of impaired loans had no allowance for impairment as of that date.      The outstanding balanc  es of impaired loans   reflect   the cumulative effects of various adjustments including, but not limited to, purchase accounting valuations and prior charge-offs, where applicable, which are considered in the evaluation of impairment.   
 With regard to loans evaluated collectively for impairment, the balance of our allowance for loan losses attributable to such loans increased by $1.2 million to $24.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $23.6 million at June 30, 2016.  The increase in valuation was partly attributable to a $170.4 million increase in the aggregate outstanding balance of loans collectively evaluated for impairment to $2.82 billion at September 30, 2016 from $2.65 billion at June 30, 2016 as well as the ongoing reallocation of loans within the portfolio in favor of commercial loans against which we generally assign comparatively higher historical and environmental loss factors in our ALLL calculation.  The increase in the allowance also reflected updates to certain environmental and historical loss factors during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 With regard to historical loss factors, our loan portfolio experienced a net annualized average charge-off rate of 0.05% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 representing a decrease of three basis points from the 0.08% of charge offs reported for the year ended June 30, 2016.  The annual average net charge off rate for June 30, 2016 had previously decreased by eight basis points from 0.16% for the prior year ended June 30, 2015.  The historical loss factors used in our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology were updated to reflect the effect of these changes by individual loan segment reflecting the two year look-back period used by that methodology. 
 In addition to reflecting the trend of a decreasing average net charge off rate on the aggregate loan portfolio, the decrease in historical loss factors for the three months ended September 30, 2016 also reflected a decrease in estimated historical loss factors applicable to our wholesale C I loan participations for which a full, two-year charge-off history is not yet available.  In such cases, we generally utilize estimated annual charge-off rates to develop the historical loss factors applicable to such loans.  As discussed in greater detail below, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company refined its methodology for developing the estimated net charge off rates used in determining the historical loss factors applicable to its C I loans.  In doing so, a more precise estimate of credit losses was developed for specific segments of the Company s wholesale C I loan participations based on the specific businesses or industry types in which the underlying borrowers conduct business. 
 The effects of the net decrease in historical loss factors arising from the changes noted above more than offset the effect of the increase in the overall balance of the unimpaired portion of the loan portfolio during the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  Consequently, the applicable portion of the allowance attributable to these factors decreased by approximately $593,000 to $2.9 million at September 30, 2016 from $3.4 million at June 30, 2016. 
 The enhancements to the historical loss factors applicable to the Company s wholesale C I loans discussed above were undertaken in conjunction with a concerted effort by the Company to expand and enhance the overall segmentation of its loan portfolio to support its larger credit risk management program which includes, but is not limited to, the allowance for loan loss calculation and loan concentration reporting regimens.  These efforts generally reflect the Company s increased strategic focus in commercial lending and the growing diversity and complexity of the risk characteristics inherent in such loans. 
  In support of these objectives, certain categories traditionally used by the Company to define and evaluate its loan portfolio for allowance for loan loss calculation purposes, were delineated into more granular  segments  during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 to better reflect their common, underlying credit risk characteristics.  For example, loans within the multi-family mortgage loan category were further segmented based on the number dwelling units while commercial mortgage loans secured by non-residential real estate were further segmented by property type/business use (e.g. office/professional, retail, mixed use, warehouse).  In similar fashion, each of the categories of the Company s commercial business loans, including its traditional business and SBA loans originated through retail channels, as well as its wholesale C I participations, were further segmented based on the specific business or industry type in which the borrower operates for allowance for loan loss calculation purposes. 
 As noted above, the  re-segmentation  of the loan portfolio enabled the Company to adopt a more precise methodology to derive its historical loss factors based on actual net charge offs by detailed loan segment while supporting a better basis upon which to develop estimates for such loss factors in the absence of sufficient historical data.  However, the re-segmentation also enabled the Company to enhance the precision by which it estimates credit losses through the use of qualitative, environmental loss factors.  Where applicable, such loss factors were re-evaluated and re-allocated to reflect the more granular segmentation of loans in the allowance for loan loss calculation at September 30, 2016.  Where appropriate, the specific criteria and/or basis upon which the Company derives the environmental loss factors ascribed to loans was revised or enhanced in conjunction with the segmentation changes noted.  No additional significant changes to environmental loss factors were implemented during the period. 
 - 46 - 

The implementation of the segmentation changes within the loan portfolio in the calculation of the allowance for loan loss at September 30, 2016 did not result in a significant change in the required, aggregate balance of the allo  wance attributable to loans evaluated collectively for impairment.  Consequently, the $1.8 million increase in the portion of the allowance for loan losses attributable to environmental loss factors to $22.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $20.2 million   at June 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to the growth in the unimpaired portion of the loan portfolio during the period.  
 Additional information about the allowance for loan losses at September 30, 2016 is presented in Note 10 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
 Other Assets.   The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes and other miscellaneous assets, increased by $1.1 million to $398.1 million at September 30, 2016 from $397.0 million at June 30, 2016.  
 The increase in other assets included a $989,000 increase in FHLB stock resulting from an increase in short-term advances drawn during the three months ended September 30, 2016 coupled with a $1.3 million increase in the cash surrender value of the Company s bank-owned life insurance policies for the same period.  These increases were partially offset by a $3.1 million decrease in deferred income tax assets arising primarily from changes in the fair value of the Company s available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios. 
 The noted increases in other assets included a $530,000 increase in the balance of real estate owned ( REO ) to $1.4 million  representing the carrying value of six properties at September 30, 2016, from $826,000, representing the carrying value of three properties at June 30, 2016. 
 The remaining increases and decreases in other assets during the year ended September 30, 2016 generally comprised normal operating fluctuations in their respective balances. 
 Deposits.   Total deposits increased by $39.1 million to $2.73 billion at September 30, 2016 from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016.  The increase in deposit balances reflected a $26.7 million increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $12.4 million increase in non-interest-bearing deposits.  The increase in interest-bearing deposits included increases in the balances of certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking accounts totaling $10.3 million and $17.5 million, respectively, which were partially offset by a $1.1 million decrease in the balance of savings and club accounts.  
 The increase in the balance of certificates of deposit largely reflected the effects of attractive retail pricing offered on a limited number of promotional products to fund a portion of the growth in loans during the period while also providing opportunities to cross-sell core deposit products to newly acquired customers.  The attractive pricing on certain certificate of deposit products resulted in a limited amount of disintermediation from other interest-bearing accounts which contributed to the changes in those balances.  The concurrent increase in non-interest-bearing deposits partly reflected fluctuating balances within certain large commercial deposit accounts.  Notwithstanding these day-to-day fluctuations, the average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits for the first three months of fiscal 2017 increased by $18.6 million to $244.0 million compared to $225.4 million for the prior fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 
 The change in deposit balances for the period reflected changes in the balances of retail deposits as well as  non-retail  deposits acquired through various wholesale channels. The $17.5 million increase in the balance of interest-bearing checking accounts reflected a $19.0 million increase in the balance of retail accounts that was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in the balance of brokered money market deposits acquired through Promontory Interfinancial Network s ( Promontory ) Insured Network Deposits ( IND ) program whose balances decreased to $222.6 million, or 8.1% of total deposits at September 30, 2016, from $224.1 million, or 8.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016. The terms of the IND program generally establish a reciprocal commitment for Promontory to deliver and for us to accept such deposits for a period of no less than five years during which time total aggregate balances shall be maintained within a range of $200.0 million to $230.0 million. Such deposits are generally sourced by Promontory from large retail and institutional brokerage firms whose individual clients seek to have a portion of their investments held in interest-bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions.  As noted above, the decrease in IND program balances was more than offset by a $19.0 million increase in retail interest-bearing checking accounts. 
 We continued to utilize a deposit listing service through which we attract  non-brokered  wholesale time deposits targeting institutional investors with an original investment horizon of three-to-five years.  We generally prohibit the withdrawal of our listing service deposits prior to maturity. The balance of the Bank s listing service time deposits decreased to $89.6 million, or 3.3% of total deposits at September 30, 2016, compared to $89.9 million, or 3.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016.

We also maintain a small portfolio of longer-term, brokered certificates of deposit that were or  iginally acquired during fiscal 2014 whose balances decreased by approximately $  112,000   to $8.  3   million at   September 30,   2016 from $  8  .4 million at June 30,   2016.   In combination with   our   Promontory IND money market deposits, our brokered deposits totaled $  2  30.9   million, or 8.  4  % of deposits at   September 30  , 2016 compared to $  232.5 million, or 8.  6% of deposits at June 30,   2016  .   
 Given the decline in the balances of wholesale time deposits, the net increase in certificates of deposit was primarily attributable to an increase in retail time deposits. 
 Borrowings.   The balance of borrowings increased by $19.0 million to $633.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $614.4 million at June 30, 2016. The increase in borrowings partly reflected a $25.0 million increase in short-term FHLB advances drawn for liquidity management purposes that was partially offset by the repayment of a maturing $3.0 million term advance.  The increase in borrowings was partially offset by a $3.0 million decrease in outstanding overnight  sweep account  balances linked to customer demand deposits that generally reflected normal operating fluctuations in such balances.  
 Other Liabilities.   The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, decreased by $6.8 million to $36.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $43.2 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease primarily reflected changes in the fair value of the Company s derivatives coupled with normal operating fluctuations in the balances of other liabilities.  
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company executed a total of five interest rate derivative transactions with an aggregate notional value of $440.0 million.  Each of the transactions represent an interest rate swap with a  forward  effective date that corresponds to the expiration date of one or more existing derivatives with the same aggregate notional value.  As such, each new derivative effectively extends the interest rate risk protection provided by one or more existing derivatives that currently serve as a cash flow hedges against existing sources of wholesale funding. 
 Stockholders  Equity.   Stockholders  equity decreased by $28.1 million to $1.12 billion at September 30, 2016 from $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016.  The decrease in stockholders  equity largely reflected the impact of the Company s share repurchases during the first three months of fiscal 2017.  The Company initiated a share repurchase program in May 2016 through which it intends to repurchase a total of 9,352,809 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 2,746,290 shares at a total cost of $35.8 million or an average cost of $13.04 per share.  Cumulatively, the Company has repurchased a total of 4,452,472 shares, or 47.6% of the shares to be repurchased under the current program through September 30, 2016 at a total cost of $58.1 million or an average cost of $13.05 per share.  The cumulative cost of the Company s repurchased shares has directly reduced the balance of stockholders  equity at September 30, 2016.  
 The net decrease in stockholders  equity was partially offset by net income of $4.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from which cash dividends of $1.7 million were paid to shareholders during the period.  The change in  stockholders  equity also reflected a $4.0 million decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss, due primarily to changes in the fair value of the Company s available for sale securities portfolio and outstanding derivatives, and a $486,000 reduction of unearned ESOP shares for plan shares earned during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Comparison of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015  
 General . Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.7 million or $0.05 per diluted share; an increase of $1.7 million from $3.0 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net income reflected increases in net interest income and non-interest income that were partially offset by increases in the provision for loan losses and non-interest expense.  These factors contributed to an overall increase in pre-tax net income and a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes.  
 Net Interest Income . Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $24.0 million; an increase of $1.6 million from $22.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in their average yield.   The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost.  
 As a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread increased one basis point to 2.02% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 2.01% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the net interest rate spread reflected a 16 basis point increase in the average yield on interest-earning assets to 3.16% for three months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.00% for the  
 - 48 - 

three months ended   September 30, 2015.  For those same comparative periods, the average   cost of interest-bearing liabilities   increased to   1.  1  4  %   from   0  .9  9  %  .    A discussion of the factors contributing to changes in the average yield and average cost of   categories within interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, respectively, is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.   
 The factors resulting in the reported increase in our net interest rate spread also affected our net interest margin.  In total, the Company s net interest margin increased four basis points to 2.32% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2.28% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
 Interest Income . Total interest income increased $3.4 million to $32.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $29.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. As noted above, the increase in interest income partly reflected a $224.2 million increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets to $4.15 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.93 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  For those same comparative periods, the yield on earning assets increased by 16 basis points to 3.16% from 3.00%.   
 Interest income from loans increased $3.7 million to $25.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $22.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.  
 The average balance of loans increased by $478.6 million to $2.70 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.22 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $469.2 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $1.98 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.51 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our commercial loans generally comprise commercial mortgage loans, including multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans, as well as secured and unsecured commercial business loans.  
 For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other loans, primarily comprising unsecured consumer term loans, account loans and deposit account overdraft lines of credit, increased by $20.3 million to $24.2 million from $3.9 million.  The increase in the average balance of other loans primarily reflected the increased balance of unsecured consumer term loans acquired through Lending Club, as described earlier. 
 The increase in the average balance of commercial and consumer loans was partially offset by an $8.3 million decrease in the average balance of residential mortgage loans to $687.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $696.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our residential mortgages generally comprise one- to four-family first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.  For those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased by $3.9 million to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $6.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 The effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 16 basis points to 3.81% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 3.97% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio largely reflected the effect of the comparatively lower average yield on most newly originated loans in relation to that of the portfolio of existing loans which has reduced the overall yield of the aggregate portfolio.  To a lesser extent, the decline in the average yield generally reflects the effects of low market interest rates that provide  rate reduction  refinancing incentive to existing borrowers while also contributing to the downward re-pricing of adjustable rate loans.  
 Interest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $577,000 to $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities coupled with a decrease in their average yield. 
 The average balance of mortgage-backed securities decreased by $79.9 million to $695.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $775.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflected the level of aggregate principal repayments and security sales between comparative periods outpacing aggregate security purchases. 
 For those same comparative periods, the average yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased by seven basis points to 2.26% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 2.33% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The reduction in the overall yield on mortgage-backed securities largely reflected the effect of the comparatively lower average yield on purchased  
 - 49 - 

securities in relation to that of the existing portfolio coupled with the continuing repayment of comparatively higher yielding securities within   the portfolio.   
 Interest income from debt securities increased by $161,000 to $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average yield of debt securities that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance.  The average yield on debt securities increased 38 basis points to 1.88% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.50% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of debt securities decreased $95.8 million to $551.9 million from $647.7 million.  
 The increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 44 basis point increase in the yield on taxable securities to 1.85% during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.41% during the three months ended September 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased five basis points to 2.01% from 1.96%. 
 The decrease in the average balance of debt securities was largely attributable to a $96.5 million decrease in the average balance of taxable securities to $442.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $538.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in taxable securities was partially offset by a $639,000 increase in the average balance of tax-exempt securities to $109.6 million from $109.0 million.  
 Interest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $142,000 to $581,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $439,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 reflecting an increase in their average yield that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance.  The average yield on other interest-earning assets increased by 52 basis points to 1.14% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.62% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased by $78.6 million to $204.6 million from $283.1 million.  
 Interest Expense . Total interest expense increased by $1.7 million to $8.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. As noted earlier, the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $244.8 million to $3.09 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.85 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 15 basis points to 1.14% from 0.99%.   
 Interest expense attributed to deposits increased by $1.3 million to $5.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was attributable to increases in the average cost and average balance of interest-bearing deposits. 
 The average cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by 14 basis points to 0.87% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 0.73% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The net increase in the average cost largely reflected an increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit which increased 16 basis points to 1.31% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 1.15% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts increased seven basis points to 0.63% from 0.56% while the average cost of savings and club accounts decreased two basis point to 0.15% from 0.17%. 
 The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $242.6 million to $2.48 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.24 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The net increase in the average balance reflected increases in the average balance of certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking accounts that were partially offset by a decrease in the average balances of savings and club accounts.  For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $223.5 million to $1.22 billion from $991.5 million while the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts increased by $23.3 million to $748.5 million from $725.2 million.  For those same comparative periods, the average balance of savings and club accounts decreased by $4.3 million to $515.6 million from $519.9 million. 
 Interest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $437,000 to $3.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense on borrowings reflected an increase in their average balance coupled with an increase in their average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $2.2 million to $610.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $608.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings increased by 28 basis points to 2.24% from 1.96%.  
 The increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $5.5 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances to $577.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $571.8 million for the three months ended September  
 - 50 - 

30  , 2015  . For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances   in  creased   29   basis points to   2.  3  5  % from   2.06  %.   The increase in the average cost of FHLB advances largely reflects the effects of a  n increase in   interest rate   hedging costs between comparative periods.  
 The noted increase in the average balance of FHLB advances was partially offset by a $3.2 million decrease in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $33.5 million from $36.7 million. The average cost of sweep accounts decreased by nine basis points to 0.42% from 0.51% between the same comparative periods.  
 Provision for Loan Losses . The provision for loan losses decreased by $1.5 million to $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The decrease was largely attributable to a lower provision on non-impaired loans evaluated collectively for impairment coupled with a decrease in specific losses recognized on nonperforming loans individually reviewed for impairment.  
 Regarding the provision on non-impaired loans, the noted decrease partly reflected the comparative effects of updates to historical and environmental loss factors between periods.  As discussed in greater detail in the preceding section of this discussion, the changes to historical loss factors partly reflected the impact of a decreasing level of net charge offs recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016 on the two-year lookback period used to calculate the Company s historical loss factors coupled with the  roll off  of the net charge offs from the same period two years earlier.  Such changes also reflected a decrease in estimated historical loss factors applicable to our wholesale C I loan participations for which a full, two-year charge-off history is not yet available.  
 The prior discussion regarding the allowance for loan losses also highlighted the impact of the  re-segmentation  of the loan portfolio on the Company s qualitative, environmental loss factors.  As noted therein, such loss factors were re-evaluated and re-allocated, where appropriate, to reflect the more granular segmentation of loans in the allowance for loan loss calculation at September 30, 2016.  Where appropriate, the specific criteria and/or basis upon which the Company derives the environmental loss factors ascribed to loans was also revised or enhanced in conjunction with the segmentation changes noted.  No additional significant changes to environmental loss factors were implemented during the period. 
 The implementation of the segmentation changes within the loan portfolio in the calculation of the allowance for loan loss at September 30, 2016 did not result in a significant change in the required, aggregate balance of the allowance attributable to loans evaluated collectively for impairment.  Consequently, decrease in the provision for loan losses largely reflected the updates to the historical loss factors noted above coupled with the effects of a comparatively lower level of growth in the unimpaired portion of the loan portfolio between comparative periods. As noted above, the decrease in provision also reflected a decrease in losses recognized on specific loans individually reviewed for impairment. 
 Additional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016 is presented in Note 10 to the unaudited consolidated financial statements as well as the Comparison of Financial Condition at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015 presented earlier.  
 Non-Interest Income . Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale and write-down of real estate owned, increased by $152,000 to $2.6 million for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 from $2.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was largely a $228,000 increase in the gain on sale of loans.  The increase in loan sale gains included a $115,000 increase in gains associated with the sale of SBA loans arising from an increase in loans originated and sold.  The increase in loan sale gains also included $112,000 in gains on sale of residential mortgage loans during the three months ended September 30, 2016 for which no such gains were recognized during the earlier comparative period due to the recent implementation and continuing expansion of the Company s mortgage banking business strategy.   
 The noted increase in non-interest income was partially offset by a $71,000 decrease in the income recognized on bank-owned life insurance that largely reflected the continuing effects of lower market interest rates on the yields earned by the Company on its underlying policies. 
 In addition to the changes in non-interest income noted above, we also recognized net losses totaling $15,000 arising from the write down and sale of REO during the three months ended September 30, 2016 for which no such losses were recognized during the earlier comparative period. 
 The changes in other components of non-interest income between comparative period generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those line items. 
 - 51 - 

Non-Interest Expenses  . Non-interest expense   in  creased   b  y   $  278,000   to $  1  8  .7   million for the three months ended   September 30  , 2016   from $  1  8  .4   million for the three months ended   September 30  , 2015  . The net   in  c  rease   in non-interest expense   partly   reflected   in  creases in   salary and employee benefit  s   expense, advertising and marketing expense   and   director compensation expense     that were partially offset by a decrease in   deposit insurance expense.    L  ess noteworthy variances in other categories of non-interest expense such   as   premises occupancy expense  ,     equipment and system expense   and   miscellaneous   expense   reflected normal growth or operating fluctuations within those categories.  
 Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $284,000 to $10.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $10.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase largely reflected the effects of annual increases in non-executive wages and salaries for fiscal 2016 and the cost of staffing additions within the lending and business development functions coupled with less noteworthy increases in employee incentive compensation and commissions expenses.  The increase in employee-compensation related expenses also reflected an increase in employee benefits expenses partly reflecting an increase in the cost of employee health insurance and retirement plan benefits while also reflecting an increase in ESOP expense arising from an increase in the market value of the Company s capital stock between comparative periods. 
 Advertising and marketing expense increased by $121,000 to $549,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $428,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase largely reflected increases in advertising expenses across a variety of advertising formats including outdoor, print and electronic media in support of the Company s loan and deposit growth initiatives. 
 The increase in director compensation expense was largely attributable to the quarterly retainers paid to the Company s two newest members of the Board of Directors who joined the Company in December 2015. 
 These noted increases in non-interest expense were partially offset by a decrease in deposit insurance expense arising from a reduction in the Bank s FDIC assessment rate that went into effect on July 1, 2016. 
 Provision for Income Taxes . The provision for income taxes increased by $1.3 million to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $850,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in income tax expense primarily reflected the underlying differences in the level of the taxable portion of pre-tax income between comparative periods.  
 Our effective tax rates during the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were 32.0% and 22.2% which, in relation to statutory income tax rates, reflected the effects of recurring sources of tax-favored income included in pre-tax income. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
 Our liquidity, represented by cash and cash equivalents, is a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings, amortization, prepayments and maturities of mortgage-backed securities and outstanding loans, maturities and calls of debt securities and funds provided from operations. In addition to cash and cash equivalents, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets such as overnight deposits or U.S. agency securities, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage-backed securities and maturing securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities.  
 The Bank is required to have enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe operation. Toward that end, we generally maintain cash and cash equivalents whose balances decreased by $126.6 million to $72.6 million at September 30, 2016 from $199.2 million at June 30, 2016.  The decrease in cash and cash equivalents reflected reinvestment of a significant portion of that excess liquidity that temporarily accumulated during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the period.  The Company reinvested that excess liquidity into the loan portfolio during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
 Management actively monitors the level of short term, liquid assets in relation to the expected need for such liquidity to fund the Company s strategic initiatives while meeting its performance and risk management objectives.  Where appropriate, the Company may alter its liquidity management strategies based upon those objectives.  The Company generally intends to reduce the average balance of cash and cash equivalents, compared to the average balance maintained during the first quarter of fiscal 2017, to further reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining excess liquidity. 
 - 52 - 

Investments that formally qualify as liquid assets are supplemented by our portfolio of securities classified as available for sale whose balances at September 30, 2016 included $296.7 million of mortgage-backed securities and $392.5 million of debt securi  ties that can readily be sold if necessary.   
 At September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase loans held in portfolio totaling approximately $40.3 million while outstanding commitments to originate loans held for sale totaled $37.3 million as of that same date.  By comparison, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate and purchase loans held in portfolio totaling $35.6 million at June 30, 2016 while outstanding commitments to originate loans held for sale totaled $16.7 million as of that same date.  Origination commitments on loans held for sale whose terms include interest rate locks to borrowers are generally paired with a  non-binding  best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price and within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established. 
 Construction loans in process and unused lines of credit were $3,000 and $61.1 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016 compared to $73,000 and $55.4 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016. The Company is also subject to the contingent liabilities resulting from letters of credit whose outstanding balances totaled $180,000 and $514,000 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  
 Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the customer. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.  
 As noted earlier, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, the balance of total deposits increased by $39.1 million to $2.73 billion from $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016.  The net increase in deposits reflected a net increase in interest-bearing deposits totaling $26.7 million coupled with an increase in non-interest-bearing checking accounts totaling $12.4 million.  The net increase in interest-bearing deposits reflected a increase in interest-bearing checking accounts and certificates of deposit totaling $17.5 million and $10.4 million, respectively, that were partially offset by a decrease in and savings and club accounts of $1.1 million.  The balance of certificates of deposit with maturities within one year increased to $742.7 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $666.1 million at June 30, 2016 with such balances representing 61.0% and 55.1% of total certificates of deposit at the close of each period, respectively.  
 Advances from the FHLB of New York are available to supplement the Company s liquidity position and, to the extent that maturing deposits do not remain with the Company, management may replace such funds with advances. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s outstanding balance of FHLB advances, excluding fair value adjustments, totaled $600.8 million. Of these advances, $145.0 million represent long-term, fixed-rate advances maturing in 2023 that have terms enabling the FHLB to call the borrowing at their option prior to maturity. The remaining balance of long-term, fixed rate advances totaled $5.2 million representing a single advance maturing during fiscal 2018. Short-term FHLB advances at September 30, 2016 included $425.0 million of fixed-rate borrowings which have been effectively converted to longer duration funding sources through the use of interest rate derivatives coupled with one overnight advance totaling $25.0 million drawn for short-term, liquidity management purpose.  The remaining $547,000 of advances represents one fixed-rate, amortizing advance maturing in 2021.  
 The Company has the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB, through a line of credit or by taking additional short-term or long-term advances. Such borrowings are an option available to management if funding needs change or to lengthen the duration of liabilities. Most of the Bank s mortgage-backed and debt securities are held in safekeeping at the FHLB of New York with a majority being available as collateral if necessary. In addition to the FHLB advances, the Bank has other borrowings totaling $32.6 million at September 30, 2016 representing overnight  sweep account  balances linked to customer demand deposits.  
 Consistent with its goals to operate a sound and profitable financial organization, the Bank actively seeks to maintain its status as a well-capitalized institution in accordance with regulatory standards. As of September 30, 2016, the Company and Bank exceeded all capital requirements of federal banking regulators.

The following table sets forth the Company s capital position at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, as   compared to the minimum regulatory capital requirements that were in effect as of those dates:  

In July 2013, the OCC and the other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that revised the risk-based and leverage capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets, to make them consistent with the agreements that were reached by the international Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.  The final rule applies to all depository institutions, top-tier bank holding companies and top-tier savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $1.0 billion or more ( banking organizations ).  Among other things, the rule established a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement (4.5% of risk-weighted assets), set the minimum leverage ratio for all banking organizations at a uniform 4% of total assets, increased the minimum Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets requirement (from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets) and assigned a higher risk weight (150%) to exposures that are more than 90 days past due or are on nonaccrual status and to certain commercial real estate facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property.  The final rule also required unrealized gains and losses on certain  available-for-sale  securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt out is exercised which the Company and the Bank intend to exercise.  The final rule limits a banking organization s dividends, stock repurchases and other capital distributions, and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers, if the bank organization does not hold a  capital conservation buffer  consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above regulatory minimum risk-based requirements.  The final rule became effective for us on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 and ending January 1, 2019, when the full capital conservation buffer requirement will be effective.  The Bank and Company each meet the fully phased in capital conservation buffer requirement at September 30, 2016 
 Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
 We are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of our business of investing in loans and securities as well as in the normal course of maintaining and improving Kearny Bank s facilities. These financial instruments include significant purchase commitments, such as commitments related to capital expenditure plans and commitments to purchase securities or mortgage-backed securities and commitments to extend credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. At September 30, 2016, we had no significant off-balance sheet commitments to purchase securities or for capital expenditures.

ITEM 3.   
      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK   
 Qualitative Analysis.  The majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Consequently, interest rate risk is a significant form of business risk that we must manage. Interest rate risk is generally defined in regulatory nomenclature as the risk to our earnings or capital arising from the movement of interest rates. It arises from several risk factors including: the differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows (re-pricing risk); the changing rate relationships among different yield curves that affect bank activities (basis risk); the changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities (yield curve risk); and the interest-rate-related options embedded in bank products (option risk).   
 Regarding the risk to our earnings, movements in interest rates significantly influence the amount of net interest income we recognized. Net interest income is the difference between:  

the interest income recorded on our interest-earning assets, such as loans, securities and other interest-earning assets; and      

the interest expense recorded on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as interest-bearing deposits and borrowings.      

 Net interest income is, by far, our largest revenue source to which we add our non-interest income and from which we deduct our provision for loan losses, non-interest expense and income taxes to calculate net income. Movements in market interest rates, and the effect of such movements on the risk factors noted above, significantly influence the  spread  between the interest earned on our loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on our deposits and borrowings. Movements in interest rates that increase, or  widen , that net interest spread enhance our net income. Conversely, movements in interest rates that reduce, or  tighten , that net interest spread adversely impact our net income.  
 For any given movement in interest rates, the resulting degree of movement in an institution s yield on interest-earning assets compared with that of its cost of interest-bearing liabilities determines if an institution is deemed  asset sensitive  or  liability sensitive . An asset sensitive institution is one whose yield on interest-earning assets reacts more quickly to movements in interest rates than its cost of interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the earnings of asset sensitive institutions are enhanced by upward movements in interest rates through which the yield on its interest-earning assets increases faster than its cost of interest-bearing liabilities resulting in a widening of its net interest spread. Conversely, the earnings of asset sensitive institutions are adversely impacted by downward movements in interest rates through which the yield on its interest-earning assets decreases faster than its cost of interest-bearing liabilities resulting in a tightening of its net interest spread.  
 In contrast, a liability sensitive institution is one whose cost of interest-bearing liabilities reacts more quickly to movements in interest rates than its yield on interest-earning assets. In general, the earnings of liability sensitive institutions are enhanced by downward movements in interest rates through which the cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreases faster than its yield on its interest-earning assets resulting in a widening of its net interest spread. Conversely, the earnings of liability sensitive institutions are adversely impacted by upward movements in interest rates through which the cost of interest-bearing liabilities increases faster than its yield on its interest-earning assets resulting in a tightening of its net interest spread.  
 The degree of an institution s asset or liability sensitivity is traditionally represented by its  gap position . In general, gap is a measurement that describes the net mismatch between the balance of an institution s interest-earning assets that are maturing and/or re-pricing over a selected period of time compared to that of its interest-costing liabilities. Positive gaps represent the greater dollar amount of interest-earning assets maturing or re-pricing over the selected period of time than interest-costing liabilities. Conversely, negative gaps represent the greater dollar amount of interest-costing liabilities than interest-earning assets maturing or re-pricing over the selected period of time. The degree to which an institution is asset or liability sensitive is reported as a negative or positive percentage of assets, respectively. The industry commonly focuses on cumulative one-year and three-year gap percentages as fundamental indicators of interest rate risk sensitivity.  
 Based upon the findings of our internal interest rate risk analysis, we are considered to be liability sensitive. Liability sensitivity characterizes the balance sheets of many thrift institutions and is generally attributable to the comparatively shorter contractual maturity and/or re-pricing characteristics of the institution s deposits and borrowings versus those of its loans and investment securities.  
 With respect to the maturity and re-pricing of our interest-bearing liabilities, at September 30, 2016, $742.7 million, or 61.0% of our certificates of deposit, mature within one year with an additional $183.9 million, or 15.1% of our certificates of deposit, maturing after one year but within two years. The remaining $291.2 million or 23.9% of certificates, at September 30, 2016 have remaining terms to maturity exceeding two years.

Excluding fair value adjustments, the balance of FHLB advances totaled $600.8 million at S  eptember 30, 2016 and comprised both short-term and long-term advances with fixed rates of interest. Short-term FHLB advances generally have original maturities of less than one year and may include overnight borrowings which Kearny Bank typically utilizes   to address short term funding needs as they arise. At September 30, 2016, Kearny Bank had a total of $425.0 million of short-term FHLB advances which represented 90-day FHLB term advances that are generally forecasted to be periodically redrawn at maturit  y for the same 90 day term as the original advance. Based on this presumption, Kearny Bank has utilized interest rate swaps to effectively extend the duration of each of these advances at the time they were drawn to effectively fix their cost for a period   of five years.  The balance of short-term advances at September 30, 2016 also included $25.0 million overnight FHLB advances drawn for liquidity management purposes  
 Long-term advances generally include advances with original maturities of greater than one year. At September 30, 2016, our outstanding balance of long-term FHLB advances totaled $150.8 million. Such advances included $145.0 million of fixed-rate, callable term advances and $5.2 million of fixed-rate, non-callable term advances as well as a $547,000 fixed-rate amortizing advance.  
 With respect to the maturity and re-pricing of our interest-earning assets, at September 30, 2016, $28.6 million, or 1.0% of our total loans, will reach their contractual maturity dates within one year with the remaining $2.81 billion, or 99.0 % of total loans having remaining terms to contractual maturity in excess of one year. Of loans maturing after one year, $1.45 billion had fixed rates of interest while the remaining $1.36 billion had adjustable rates of interest, with such loans representing 51.1% and 47.9% of total loans, respectively. 
 At September 30, 2016, $3.6 million, or 0.3% of our total securities, will reach their contractual maturity dates within one year with the remaining $1.22 billion, or 99.7 % of total securities, having remaining terms to contractual maturity in excess of one year. Of the latter category, $863.3 million comprising 70.3 % of our total securities had fixed rates of interest while the remaining $360.5 million comprising 29.4 % of our total securities had adjustable or floating rates of interest. 
 At September 30, 2016, mortgage-related assets, including mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities, totaled $3.42 billion and comprised 82.1% of total earning assets. In addition to remaining term to maturity and interest rate type as discussed above, other factors contribute significantly to the level of interest rate risk associated with mortgage-related assets. In particular, the scheduled amortization of principal and the borrower s option to prepay any or all of a mortgage loan s principal balance, where applicable, have a significant effect on the average lives of such assets and, therefore, the interest rate risk associated with them. In general, the prepayment rate on lower yielding assets tends to slow as interest rates rise due to the reduced financial incentive for borrowers to refinance their loans. By contrast, the prepayment rate of higher yielding assets tends to accelerate as interest rates decline due to the increased financial incentive for borrowers to prepay or refinance their loans to comparatively lower interest rates. These characteristics tend to diminish the benefits of falling interest rates to liability sensitive institutions while exacerbating the adverse impact of rising interest rates.  
 We generally retained our liability sensitivity during the first three months of fiscal 2017 while the degree of that sensitivity, as measured internally by the institution s one-year and three-year gap percentages increased during the period. Specifically, our cumulative one-year gap percentage changed to (13.93)% at September 30, 2016 from (9.31)% at June 30, 2016 while our cumulative three-year gap percentage changed to (6.95)% from (6.02)% over those same comparative periods.  Our one-year and three-year gap measures do not currently reflect the effect of our interest rate derivatives and the effective extension of liability duration arising from their use as cash flow hedges.  The increase in the gap percentages between periods partly reflected the effects of a decrease in short-term liquid assets attributable to the deployment of the excess liquidity that was temporarily held in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016.  The excess liquidity had temporarily accumulated during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 due to an increase loan prepayments and was subsequently reinvested into the loan portfolio during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 
 As a liability-sensitive institution, our net interest spread is generally expected to benefit from overall reductions in market interest rates. Conversely, our net interest spread is generally expected to be adversely impacted by overall increases in market interest rates. However, the general effects of movements in market interest rates can be diminished or exacerbated by  nonparallel  movements in interest rates across a yield curve. Nonparallel movements in interest rates generally occur when shorter term and longer term interest rates move disproportionately in a directionally consistent manner. For example, shorter term interest rates may decrease faster than longer term interest rates which would generally result in a  steeper  yield curve. Alternately, nonparallel movements in interest rates may also occur when shorter term and longer term interest rates move in a directionally inconsistent manner. For example, shorter term interest rates may rise while longer term interest rates remain steady or decline which would generally result in a  flatter  yield curve.  
 At its extreme, a yield curve may become  inverted  for a period of time during which shorter term interest rates exceed longer term interest rates. While inverted yield curves do occasionally occur, they are generally considered a  temporary  phenomenon portending a change in economic conditions that will restore the yield curve to its normal, positively sloped shape.  
 - 57 - 

In general, the interest rates paid on our deposits tend to be determined based upon the level of shorter term interest rates. By contrast, the interest rates earned o  n our loans and investment securities generally tend to be based upon the level of comparatively longer term interest rates to the extent such assets are fixed-rate in nature. As such, the overall  spread  between shorter term and longer term interest rate  s when earning assets and costing liabilities re-price greatly influences our overall net interest spread over time. In general, a wider spread between shorter term and longer term interest rates, implying a  steeper  yield curve, is beneficial to our net   interest spread. By contrast, a narrower spread between shorter term and longer term interest rates, implying a  flatter  yield curve, or a negative spread between those measures, implying an inverted yield curve, adversely impacts our net interest spread.     
 We continue to execute various strategies to mitigate the risk to our net interest rate spread and margin arising from adverse changes in interest rates and the shape of the yield curve. Such strategies include deploying excess liquidity in higher yielding interest-earning assets, such as commercial loans and investment securities, while continuing to generally maintain our cost of interest-bearing liabilities at low levels while extending their duration through various deposit pricing strategies. For example, we have extended the duration of our wholesale funding sources through cost effective use of interest rate derivatives that effectively converted short-term wholesale funding sources into longer-term, fixed-rate funding sources. 
 Notwithstanding these efforts, the risk of further net interest rate spread and margin compression is significant as the yield on our interest-earning assets continues to reflect the impact of the greater declines in longer term market interest rates in recent years compared to the lesser concurrent reductions in shorter term market interest rates that affect the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. In particular, our ability to further reduce the cost of our interest-bearing deposits is increasingly limited since many of our deposit offering rates are already well below 1.00% at September 30, 2016. Moreover, our liability sensitivity may adversely affect net income in the future as market interest rates continue to increase from their prior historical lows and our cost of interest-bearing liabilities may rise faster than our yield on interest-earning assets.  
 Given the inherent liability sensitivity of our balance sheet, our business plan also calls for greater expansion into C I lending. Toward that end, we are continuing to expand our retail lending resources with an experienced team of business lenders focused on the origination of floating-rate and shorter-term fixed-rate loans and the corresponding core deposit account balances typically associated with such relationships. As a complement to this retail business lending strategy, we have implemented strategies through which floating-rate and other shorter-term fixed-rate C I and consumer loans are acquired through wholesale resources.  
 We maintain an Asset/Liability Management ( ALM ) Program to address all matters relating to the management of interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The program is overseen by the Board of Directors through our Interest Rate Risk Management Committee comprising five members of the Board with our Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Risk Officer participating as management s liaison to the committee. The committee meets quarterly to address management of our assets and liabilities, including review of our liquidity and interest rate risk profiles, loan and deposit pricing and production volumes, investment and wholesale funding strategies, and a variety of other asset and liability management topics. The results of the committee s quarterly review are reported to the full Board, which adjusts our ALM policies and strategies, as it considers necessary and appropriate.  
 The Board of Directors has assigned the responsibility for the operational aspects of the ALM program to our Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ). The ALCO is a management committee comprising the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Lending Officer, Branch Administrator, Chief Risk Officer, Treasurer/Chief Investment Officer and Controller. Additional members of our management team may be asked to participate on the ALCO, as appropriate.  
 Responsibilities conveyed to the ALCO by the Board of Directors include:  

developing ALM-related policies and associated operating procedures and controls that will identify and measure the risks associated with ALM while establishing the limits and thresholds relating thereto;      

developing ALM-related operating strategies and tactics designed to manage the relevant risks within the applicable policy thresholds and limits while supporting the achievement of the goals and objectives of our strategic business plan;      

developing, implementing and maintaining a management- and Board-level ALM monitoring and reporting system;      

ensuring that the ALCO and the Board of Directors are kept abreast of current technologies, procedures and industry best practices that may be utilized to carry out their ALM-related duties and responsibilities;      

ensuring the periodic independent validation of Kearny Bank s ALM risk management policies and operating practices and controls; and      

conducting periodic ALCO committee meetings to review all matters relating to ALM strategies and risk management activities.

Quantitative Analysis.   The quantitative analysis regularly conducted by management measu  res interest rate risk from both a capital and earnings perspective. With regard to capital, our internal interest rate risk analysis calculates the sensitivity of our Economic Value of Equity ( EVE ) ratio to movements in interest rates. EVE represents th  e present value of the expected cash flows from our assets less the present value of the expected cash flows arising from our liabilities adjusted for the value of off-balance sheet contracts. The EVE ratio represents the dollar amount of our EVE divided b  y the present value of our total assets for a given interest rate scenario. In essence, EVE attempts to quantify our economic value using a discounted cash flow methodology while the EVE ratio reflects that value as a form of capital ratio. The degree to w  hich the EVE ratio changes for any hypothetical interest rate scenario from its  base case  measurement is a reflection of an institution s sensitivity to interest rate risk.   
 Our EVE ratio is first calculated in a  base case  scenario that assumes no change in interest rates as of the measurement date. The model then measures the change in the EVE ratio throughout a series of interest rate scenarios representing immediate and permanent, parallel shifts in the yield curve up and down 100, 200 and 300 basis points with additional scenarios modeled where appropriate. The model requires that interest rates remain positive for all points along the yield curve for each rate scenario which may preclude the modeling of certain  down rate  scenarios during periods of lower market interest rates. Our interest rate risk management policy establishes acceptable floors for the EVE ratio and caps for the maximum change in the EVE ratio throughout the scenarios modeled.  
 As illustrated in the tables below, our EVE would be negatively impacted by an increase in interest rates. This result is expected given our liability sensitivity noted earlier. Specifically, based upon the comparatively shorter maturity and/or re-pricing characteristics of our interest-bearing liabilities compared with that of our interest-earning assets, an upward movement in interest rates would have a disproportionately adverse impact on the present value of our assets compared to the beneficial impact arising from the reduced present value of our liabilities. Hence, our EVE and EVE ratio decline in the increasing interest rate scenarios. Historically low interest rates at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 precluded the modeling of certain scenarios as parallel downward shifts in the yield curve of 100 basis points or more would result in negative interest rates for many points along that curve.  
 The following tables present the results of our internal EVE analysis as of September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. 

As seen in the table above, the dollar amount of EVE and the EVE ratio have declined between comparative periods across most scenarios modeled while the sensitivity of those measures to movements in interest rates between comparative periods decreased.  The decrease in the EVE ratios across all rate scenarios partly reflected the overall decrease in stockholders  equity arising from the Company s repurchase of its shares of common stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  By contrast, the decrease in the sensitivity of EVE to movements in interest rates between comparative periods largely reflects the effects of the additional interest rate derivatives executed during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that effectively extended the duration of the Bank s wholesale funding sources.  These benefits were partially offset by the effects of the reduction in short-term liquid assets noted earlier.  As modeled in our EVE-based analysis, short-term liquid assets are generally expected to retain their market value throughout all rate  
 - 59 - 

change scenarios.    As such, the note decrease in the balance of such funds increased the overall sensitivity of earning assets and EVE to movements in interest rates at September 30, 2016 compared to June 30, 2016.  
 In addition to the specific considerations noted above, there are numerous internal and external factors that may also contribute to changes in an institution s EVE ratio and its sensitivity. Internally, changes in the composition and allocation of an institution s balance sheet and the interest rate risk characteristics of its components can significantly alter the exposure to interest rate risk as quantified by the changes in the EVE sensitivity measures. Toward that end, the reported increase in EVE sensitivity also reflects the aggregate effects of the various balance sheet management strategies we have undertaken to deploy capital through profitable growth and diversification strategies while managing our exposure to interest rate risk.  Changes to certain external factors, most notably changes in the level of market interest rates and overall shape of the yield curve, can also alter the projected cash flows of the institution s interest-earning assets and interest-costing liabilities and the associated present values thereof.  Changes in internal and external factors from period to period can complement one another s effects to reduce overall sensitivity, partly or wholly offset one another s effects, or exacerbate one another s adverse effects and thereby increase the institution s exposure to interest rate risk as quantified by EVE sensitivity measures.  
 Our internal interest rate risk analysis also includes an  earnings-based  component.  A quantitative, earnings-based approach to measuring interest rate risk is strongly encouraged by bank regulators as a complement to the  EVE-based  methodology. However, there are no commonly accepted  industry best practices  that specify the manner in which  earnings-based  interest rate risk analysis should be performed with regard to certain key modeling variables. Such variables include, but are not limited to, those relating to rate scenarios (e.g., immediate and permanent rate  shocks  versus gradual rate change  ramps ,  parallel  versus  nonparallel  yield curve changes), measurement periods (e.g., one year versus two year, cumulative versus noncumulative), measurement criteria (e.g., net interest income versus net income) and balance sheet composition and allocation ( static  balance sheet, reflecting reinvestment of cash flows into like instruments, versus  dynamic  balance sheet, reflecting internal budget and planning assumptions).  
 The absence of a commonly shared, industry-standard set of analysis criteria and assumptions on which to base an  earnings-based  analysis could result in inconsistent or misinterpreted disclosure concerning an institution s level of interest rate risk. Consequently, we limit the presentation of our earnings-based interest rate risk analysis to the scenarios presented in the table below. Consistent with the EVE analysis above, such scenarios utilize immediate and permanent rate  shocks  that result in parallel shifts in the yield curve. For each scenario, projected net interest income is measured over a one year period utilizing a static balance sheet assumption through which incoming and outgoing asset and liability cash flows are reinvested into the same instruments. Product pricing and earning asset prepayment speeds are appropriately adjusted for each rate scenario.  
 As illustrated in the tables below, at September 30, 2016, our net interest income ( NII ) would have been adversely impacted by a parallel upward shift in the yield curve.  The  liability sensitivity  as measured from an NII perspective at September 30, 2016 is generally consistent with the  liability sensitivity  exhibited in the Company s EVE-based analysis. 
 As noted earlier, the excess liquidity that had previously accumulated in cash equivalents through June 30, 2016 was re-invested into the loan portfolio during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 which had the effect of increasing the forecasted level across most the scenarios presented below.  However, the sensitivity of interest income to movements in interest rates increased as a result of that re-investment.  The changes in the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates also reflect the aggregate impact of the various balance sheet management strategies we have undertaken to deploy capital through profitable growth and diversification strategies while also reflecting the effects of changes in the level of market interest rates and overall shape of the yield curve. 
 - 60 - 

The level and direction of risk exposure assessed by the NII-based and EVE-based methodologies may differ based on the comparative terms over which risk exposure is measured by those   methodologies, as they did at June 30, 2016.  As noted earlier, EVE-based analysis generally takes a longer-term view of interest rate risk by measuring changes in the present value of cash flows of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities   over their expected lives.  By contrast, the NII-based analysis presented below takes a comparatively shorter-term view of interest rate risk by measuring the forecasted changes in the net interest income generated by those interest-earning assets and int  erest-bearing liabilities over a one-year period.  

Notwithstanding the rate change scenarios presented in the EVE and earnings-based analyses above, future interest rates and their effect on net portfolio value or net interest income are not predictable. Computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions, including relative levels of market interest rates, prepayments and deposit run-offs and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results. Certain shortcomings are inherent in this type of computation. Although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturity or periods of re-pricing, they may react at different times and in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. The interest rate on certain types of assets and liabilities, such as demand deposits and savings accounts, may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates, while rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in market interest rates. Certain assets, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, generally have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of a change in interest rates, prepayments and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in making calculations set forth above. Additionally, an increased credit risk may result as the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase.

ITEM 4.   
      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
 As of the end of the period covered by the report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based on that evaluation, the Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
 During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
