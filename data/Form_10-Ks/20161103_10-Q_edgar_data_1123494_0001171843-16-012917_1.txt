    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

1.      Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation   

The unaudited consolidated financial statements of Harvard Bioscience,
Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively,  Harvard Bioscience  or the  Company ) as of September
30, 2016 and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the
rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Certain information and footnote disclosures
normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S.
GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The December 31, 2015 consolidated balance
sheet was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. However, the Company
believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. These unaudited consolidated financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which include normal
recurring adjustments necessary to present a fair statement of financial position as of September 30, 2016, results of operations
and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, as applicable, have been made. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full fiscal year or any future periods. 

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

The accounting policies underlying the accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements are those set forth in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in the Company s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016. 

2.      Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   a new accounting standard
that provides for a comprehensive model to use in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers that will replace
most existing revenue recognition guidance within generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Under this standard,
revenue will be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. At its July 2015 meeting, the FASB agreed
to defer the mandatory effective date of ASU 2014-09 one year. Under the one year deferral, the standard will take effect in 2018
for calendar year-end public entities. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying
Measurement of Inventory . The update requires measurement of most inventory  at the lower of cost and net realizable
value , and applies to all entities that recognize inventory within the scope of ASC 330, except for inventory measured under
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method (RIM). ASU 2015-11 requires prospective application and represents
a change in accounting principle. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early
adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which
is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The update requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet
the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease terms of more than 12 months. The update is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation  
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities
and classification on the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and
early adoption is permitted. 

Table of Contents     

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments
  Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of credit losses on Financial Instruments.  The update amends the FASB s
guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The ASU adds to U.S. GAAP an impairment model (known as the current expected
credit loss (CECL) model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes
as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such
losses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of
Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230)  which amends ASC 230,  Statement of Cash Flows  to add or clarify
guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 

The Company is evaluating the impact of each of ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-11,
ASU 2016-02, ASU 2016-09, ASU 2016-13 and ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial statements. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation
of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . Under this guidance, debt issuance costs related to a recognized
debt liability should be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
The provisions of this guidance are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this guidance during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015, included in these consolidated financial statements, reflects a restatement to reclassify unamortized
deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million from other long-term assets to long-term debt. For deferred financing costs
paid to secure long-term debt, the Company made a policy election to present such costs as a direct deduction from the debt liability
on the consolidated balance sheet. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16 , Simplifying
the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments . The update eliminates the requirement to retrospectively adjust financial
statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination. Under the update, measurement-period
adjustments are to be calculated as if they were known at the acquisition date, but are recognized in the reporting period in which
they are determined. Additional disclosures are required about the impact on current-period earnings. ASU 2015-16 requires prospective
application to adjustments of provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. The update was effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-16 on January 1, 2016. The adoption of ASU 2015-16 did
not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance
Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The update requires all deferred income taxes to be presented on the balance sheet
as noncurrent. The new guidance is intended to simplify financial reporting by eliminating the requirement to classify deferred
taxes between current and noncurrent. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early
adoption is permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
early adopted the new guidance on a prospective basis and has presented all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as
noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. Prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements
were not retrospectively adjusted. 

3.      Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss  

Changes in each component of accumulated other comprehensive loss,
net of tax are as follows: 

Table of Contents     

4.      Acquisitions  

The Company completed one acquisition during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

HEKA Elektronik   

On January 8, 2015, the Company, through its wholly-owned Ealing
Scientific Limited and Multi Channel Systems MCS GmbH ( MCS ) subsidiaries, acquired all of the issued and outstanding
shares of HEKA Elektronik ( HEKA ) for approximately $5.9 million, or $4.5 million, net of cash acquired. Included
in the acquisition of HEKA were: HEKA Electronik Dr. Schulze GmbH, based in Lambrecht, Germany ( HEKA Germany ); HEKA
Electronics Incorporated, based in Chester, Nova Scotia, Canada ( HEKA Canada ); and HEKA Instruments Incorporated,
based in Bellmore, New York. The Company funded the acquisition from its existing cash balances. 

HEKA is a developer, manufacturer and marketer of sophisticated
electrophysiology instrumentation and software for biomedical and industrial research applications. This acquisition is complementary
to the electrophysiology line currently offered by the Company s wholly-owned Warner Instruments and MCS subsidiaries. 

The aggregate purchase price for this acquisition was allocated
to tangible and intangible assets acquired as follows: 

Goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of HEKA is not
deductible for tax purposes. 

In the second quarter of 2016, an immaterial correction was made
to the allocation of the aggregate purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets acquired to increase both accrued liabilities
and goodwill by $50,000 as of June 30, 2016. This correction has been reflected in the table above. 

The results of operations for HEKA have been included in the Company s
consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 

Direct acquisition costs recorded in other expense, net in the Company s
consolidated statements of operations were immaterial for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.
Direct acquisition costs recorded in other expense, net in the Company s consolidated statements of operations were $0.2
million and $0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.

5.      Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

Intangible assets consist of the following: 

(a) Weighted average life as of September 30, 2016.    

The change in the carrying amount of goodwill for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

Impairment of intangible assets  

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company initiated plans to
sell the operations of its AHN Biotechnologie GmbH subsidiary ( AHN ), a manufacturer of liquid handling products,
located in Nordhausen, Germany. The Company assessed the held for sale accounting guidance, pursuant to ASC 360-10, and concluded
that it had not met all the criteria for AHN s assets and liabilities to be classified as held for sale as of September 30,
2016. As such, AHN s assets and liabilities continue to be presented as held and used, and the results of its operations
included within continuing operations as of, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

As a result of the Company initiating plans to sell the
operations of AHN, the Company evaluated the long-lived assets for impairment, pursuant to ASC 360-10. Based on the
impairment analysis,  the
carrying amount of the long-lived assets exceeded the fair value of the long-lived assets as determined using the probability
weighted present value of future cash flows. As a result,  the Company recognized an impairment charge of $0.7 million
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 as part of operating expenses within its statements of operations. Of
the overall charge, approximately $0.1 million was allocated to its intangible assets (trade name and
customer relationships), while the remainder of the charge was allocated to its property, plant and equipment (machinery
and equipment). 

As also noted in footnote 18, on October 26, 2016, the Company sold
AHN for $1.7 million in cash proceeds. 

Table of Contents     

Amortization of intangible assets  

Intangible asset amortization expense was $0.7 million for both
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Intangible asset amortization expense was $2.1 million for both the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense of existing amortizable intangible assets is currently estimated to be
$2.6 million for the year ending December 31, 2016, $2.5 million for the year ending December 31, 2017, $2.3 million
for the year ending December 31, 2018, $2.2 million for the year ending December 31, 2019 and $2.1 million for the year
ending December 31, 2020. 

6.      Inventories  

Inventories consist of the following: 

7.      Property, Plant and Equipment  

As disclosed in footnote 5, as a result of its decision to initiate
a plan to sell the operations of AHN, during the third quarter of 2016 the Company recorded an impairment charge to property, plant
and equipment of $0.6 million. 

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, property, plant and equipment
consist of the following: 

8.      Restructuring and Other Exit Costs  

During 2014, and 2015, the Company entered into various restructuring
plans, which included eliminating certain positions made redundant as a result of its site consolidations, as well as a realignment
of its commercial sales team. The 2014 restructuring plan included plans to relocate the distribution operations of the Company s
Denville Scientific subsidiary from New Jersey to North Carolina, as well as consolidating the manufacturing operations of its
Biochrom subsidiary to its headquarters in Holliston, MA. Activity and liability balances related to these charges during
the current year were as follows:

9.      Related Party Transactions  

As part of the acquisitions of MCS and Triangle BioSystems, Inc.
( TBSI ) in 2014, the Company signed lease agreements with the former owners of the acquired companies. The principals
of such former owners of MCS and TBSI were employees of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. Pursuant to a lease agreement,
the Company incurred rent expense of approximately $59,000 and $172,000 to the former owners of MCS for both the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The Company incurred rent expense of approximately $11,000
and $32,000 to the former owners of TBSI for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.

Table of Contents     

11.      Employee Benefit Plans  

Certain of the Company s subsidiaries in the United Kingdom,
or UK, Harvard Apparatus Limited and Biochrom Limited, maintain contributory, defined benefit or defined contribution pension plans
for substantially all of their employees. These defined benefit pension plans are closed to new employees, as well as closed to
the future accrual of benefits for existing employees. The components of the Company s defined benefit pension expense were
as follows: 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company
contributed $0.2 million, for both periods, to its defined benefit pension plans. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, the Company contributed $0.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, to its defined benefit pension plans.
The Company expects to contribute approximately $0.3 million to its defined benefit pension plans during the remainder of 2016. 

The Company had an underfunded pension liability of approximately
$2.5 million and $2.8 million, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, included in the other long term liabilities
line item in the consolidated balance sheets. 

The Company has noncancelable operating leases for office and warehouse
space expiring at various dates through 2021 and thereafter. Rent expense, which is recorded on a straight-line basis, is estimated
to be $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Rent expense was approximately $0.5 million and $0.6 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Rent expense was approximately $1.4 million and $1.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Future minimum lease payments for operating leases, with initial
or remaining terms in excess of one year at September 30, 2016, are as follows: 

Common Stock   

On February 5, 2008, the Company s Board of Directors
adopted a Shareholder Rights Plan and declared a dividend distribution of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding
share of the Company s common stock to shareholders of record as of the close of business on February 6, 2008. Initially,
these rights will not be exercisable and will trade with the shares of the Company s common stock. Under the Shareholder
Rights Plan, the rights generally will become exercisable if a person becomes an  acquiring person  by acquiring 20%
or more of the common stock of the Company or if a person commences a tender offer that could result in that person owning 20%
or more of the common stock of the Company. If a person becomes an acquiring person, each holder of a right (other than the acquiring
person) would be entitled to purchase, at the then-current exercise price, such number of shares of preferred stock which are equivalent
to shares of the Company s common stock having a value of twice the exercise price of the right. If the Company is acquired
in a merger or other business combination transaction after any such event, each holder of a right would then be entitled to purchase,
at the then-current exercise price, shares of the acquiring company s common stock having a value of twice the exercise price
of the right. 

Table of Contents     

Preferred Stock  

The Company s Board of Directors has the authority to issue
up to 5.0 million shares of preferred stock and to determine the price privileges and other terms of the shares. The Board of Directors
may exercise this authority without any further approval of stockholders. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no preferred
stock issued or outstanding. 

Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended, the  ESPP )  

In 2000, the Company approved the ESPP. Under this ESPP, participating
employees can authorize the Company to withhold a portion of their base pay during consecutive six-month payment periods for the
purchase of shares of the Company s common stock. At the conclusion of the period, participating employees can purchase shares
of the Company s common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company s common stock at the beginning
or end of the period. Shares are issued under the ESPP for the six-month periods ending June 30 and December 31. Under
this plan, 750,000 shares of common stock are authorized for issuance of which 683,364 shares were issued as of September 30, 2016.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company issued 39,353 shares and 26,181 shares, respectively, of
the Company s common stock under the ESPP. There were no shares issued under the ESPP during the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015. 

Stock Option and Equity Incentive Plans  

Third Amended and Restated 2000 Stock Option and Incentive Plan
(as amended, the  Third A R Plan )  

The Second Amendment to the Third A R Plan (the  Amendment )
was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 3, 2015. Such Amendment was approved by the stockholders at the Company s
2015 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Pursuant to the Amendment, the aggregate number of shares authorized for issuance under the
Third A R Plan was increased by 2,500,000 shares to 17,508,929. 

Restricted Stock Units with a Market Condition (the  Market
Condition RSU s )  

On August 3, 2015, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors
of the Company approved and granted deferred stock awards of Market Condition RSU s to certain members of the Company s
management team under the Third A R Plan. The vesting of these Market Condition RSU s is cliff-based and linked to the
achievement of a relative total shareholder return of the Company s common stock from August 3, 2015 to the earlier of (i)
August 3, 2018 or (ii) upon a change of control (measured relative to the Russell 3000 index and based on the 20-day trading average
price before each such date). As of September 30, 2016, the target number of these restricted stock units that may be earned is
182,150 shares; the maximum amount is 150% of the target number. 

Stock-Based Payment Awards  

The Company accounts for stock-based payment awards in accordance
with the provisions of FASB ASC 718, which requires it to recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made
to employees and directors including stock options, restricted stock units, Market Condition RSU s and employee stock purchases
related to the ESPP.

Stock option and restricted stock unit activity under the Company s
Third A R Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows: 

The weighted average fair value of the options granted under the
Third A R Plan during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.11 and $2.14, respectively. The weighted average
fair value of the options granted under the Third A R Plan during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.21
and $2.21, respectively. The following assumptions were used to estimate the fair value, using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model, of stock options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

The weighted average fair value of the Market Condition RSU s
granted under the Third A R Plan during the three months ended September 30, 2015 was $4.81. The following assumptions were
used to estimate the fair value, using a Monte-Carlo valuation simulation, of the Market Condition RSU s granted during the
three months ended September 30, 2015: 

The Company used historical volatility to calculate the expected
volatility for each grant as of the grant date. Historical volatility was determined by calculating the mean reversion of the daily
adjusted closing stock price. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed U.S. Treasury bill interest rates (risk-free)
appropriate for the term of the Company s stock options and Market Condition RSU s. The expected holding period of
stock options represents the period of time options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience. The vesting
period ranges from one to four years and the contractual life is ten years. The correlation coefficient, used to value the Market
Condition RSU s, represents the way in which entities move in relation to the Russell 3000 index as a whole. 

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted
stock units, Market Condition RSU s and the ESPP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was allocated
as follows: 

The Company did not capitalize any stock-based compensation. 

Table of Contents     

Earnings per share  

Basic earnings per share is based upon net income divided by the
number of weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes conversion
of stock options, restricted stock units and Market Condition RSU s into common stock using the treasury method. The weighted
average number of shares used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share consists of the following: 

Excluded from the shares used in calculating the diluted earnings
per common share in the above table are options, restricted stock units and Market Condition RSU s of approximately 5,300,945
and 5,640,536 shares of common stock for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as the impact
of these shares would be anti-dilutive. 

On August 7, 2009, the Company entered into an Amended and
Restated Revolving Credit Loan Agreement related to a $20.0 million revolving credit facility with Bank of America, as agent, and
Bank of America and Brown Brothers Harriman   Co as lenders (as amended, the  2009 Credit Agreement ). Between
September 2011, and June 2016, the Company entered into six amendments that among other things extended the maturity date of the
credit facility; reduced interest rates; converted existing loan advances into a term loan in the principal amount of $15.0 million
(the  Term Loan ); provided a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of $25.0 million ( Revolving
Line ); provided a delayed draw term loan of up to $10.0 million (the  DDTL ); amended the principal payment
amortization of the Term Loan and DDTL to five years, as well as amended the Company s quarterly minimum fixed charge coverage
financial covenant. 

The maximum amount available under the Credit Agreement is $50.0
million as borrowings against the DDTL in excess of $10.0 million results in a dollar for dollar reduction in the Revolving Line
capacity. The Revolving Line, Term Loan and DDTL each have a maturity date of March 29, 2018. Borrowings under the Term Loan
and the DDTL accrue interest at a rate based on either the effective London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for certain interest
periods selected by the Company, or a daily floating rate based on the British Bankers  Association (BBA) LIBOR as published
by Reuters (or other commercially available source providing quotations of BBA LIBOR), plus in either case, a margin of 2.75%.
Additionally, the Revolving Line accrues interest at a rate based on either the effective LIBOR for certain interest periods selected
by the Company, or a daily floating rate based on the BBA LIBOR, plus in either case, a margin of 2.25%. The Company was required
to fix the rate of interest on at least 50% of the Term Loan and the DDTL through the purchase of interest rate swaps.  

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,  Interest
- Imputation of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . Under this guidance, debt issuance costs related
to a recognized debt liability should be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that
debt liability. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this guidance during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, included in these consolidated financial statements, reflects a restatement to reclassify
unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million from other long-term assets to long-term debt. For deferred
financing costs paid to secure long-term debt, the Company made a policy election to present such costs as a direct deduction from
the debt liability on the consolidated balance sheet. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had
net borrowings of $15.0 million and $18.7 million, respectively, outstanding under its Credit Agreement. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, was subject to covenant and working
capital borrowing restrictions and had available borrowing capacity under its Credit Agreement of $7.8 million. 

Table of Contents     

As of September 30, 2016, the weighted effective interest rates,
net of the impact of the Company s interest rate swaps, on its Term Loan, DDTL and Revolving Line borrowings were 3.96%,
3.60% and 2.77%, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s
borrowings were comprised of: 

The Company uses interest-rate-related derivative instruments to
manage its exposure related to changes in interest rates on its variable-rate debt instruments. The Company does not enter into
derivative instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging. The Company does not speculate using derivative instruments. 

By using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to
changes in interest rates, the Company exposes itself to credit risk and market risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty
to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty
owes the Company, which creates credit risk for the Company. When the fair value of a derivative contract is negative, the Company
owes the counterparty and, therefore, the Company is not exposed to the counterparty s credit risk in those circumstances.
The Company minimizes counterparty credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with carefully selected
major financial institutions based upon their credit profile. 

Market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a derivative instrument
that results from a change in interest rates. The market risk associated with interest-rate contracts is managed by establishing
and monitoring parameters that limit the types and degree of market risk that may be undertaken. 

The Company assesses interest rate risk by continually identifying
and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging
opportunities. The Company maintains risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk attributable to both the Company s
outstanding or forecasted debt obligations as well as the Company s offsetting hedge positions. The risk management control
systems involve the use of analytical techniques, including cash flow sensitivity analysis, to estimate the expected impact of
changes in interest rates on the Company s future cash flows. 

The Company uses variable-rate London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
debt to finance its operations. The debt obligations expose the Company to variability in interest payments due to changes in interest
rates. Management believes that it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of its interest payments. To meet this objective,
management enters into LIBOR based interest rate swap agreements to manage fluctuations in cash flows resulting from changes in
the benchmark interest rate of LIBOR. These swaps change the variable-rate cash flow exposure on the debt obligations to fixed
cash flows. Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the Company receives LIBOR based variable interest rate payments and makes
fixed interest rate payments, thereby creating the equivalent of fixed-rate debt for the notional amount of its debt hedged. In
accordance with its Credit Agreement, the Company was required to fix the rate of interest on at least 50% of its Term Loan and
the DDTL through the purchase of interest rate swaps. On June 5, 2013, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract
with an original notional amount of $15.0 million and a maturity date of March 29, 2018 in order to hedge the risk of changes in
the effective benchmark interest rate (LIBOR) associated with the Company s Term Loan. On November 29, 2013, the Company
entered into a second interest rate swap contract with an original notional amount of $5.0 million and a maturity date of March
29, 2018 in order to hedge the risk of changes in the effective benchmark interest rate (LIBOR) associated with the DDTL. The notional
amount of the Company s derivative instruments as of September 30, 2016 was $6.5 million. The Term Loan swap contract effectively
converted specific variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt and fixed the LIBOR rate associated with the Term Loan at 0.96% plus
a bank margin of 2.75%. The DDTL swap contract effectively converted specific variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt and fixed
the LIBOR rate associated with the Term Loan at 0.93% plus a bank margin of 2.75%.The interest rate swaps were designated as cash
flow hedges in accordance with ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging . 

Table of Contents     

The following table presents the notional amount and fair value
of the Company s derivative instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

(a) See Note 16 for the fair value measurements related to these financial instruments.  

All of the Company s derivative instruments are designated
as hedging instruments. 

The Company has structured its interest rate swap agreements to
be 100% effective and as a result, there was no impact to earnings resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. Changes in the fair value
of interest rate swaps designated as hedging instruments that effectively offset the variability of cash flows associated with
variable-rate, long-term debt obligations are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ). These amounts
subsequently are reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment of the hedged interest payments in the same period in
which the related interest affects earnings. The Company s interest rate swap agreement was deemed to be fully effective
in accordance with ASC 815, and, as such, unrealized gains and losses related to these derivatives were recorded as AOCI. 

The following table summarizes the effect of derivatives designated
as cash flow hedging instruments and their classification within comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015: 

The following table summarizes the reclassifications out of accumulated
other comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Table of Contents     

As of September 30, 2016, $15,000 of deferred losses on derivative
instruments accumulated in AOCI are expected to be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months. Transactions and events
expected to occur over the next twelve months that will necessitate reclassifying these derivatives  losses to earnings include
the repricing of variable-rate debt. There were no cash flow hedges discontinued during 2016 or 2015. 

16.      Fair Value Measurements  

Fair value measurement is defined as the price that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy is established, which prioritizes
the inputs used in measuring fair value into three broad levels as follows: 

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities. 

 Level 2 Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that
are observable either directly or indirectly. 

 Level 3 Unobservable inputs based on the Company s own assumptions. 

The following tables present the fair value hierarchy for those
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The Company uses the market approach technique to value its financial
liabilities. The Company s financial liabilities carried at fair value include derivative instruments used to hedge the Company s
interest rate risks. The fair value of the Company s interest rate swap agreements was based on LIBOR yield curves at the
reporting date.  

Income tax was an approximately $0.8 million expense and a $0.2
million benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The tax expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 reflects the incremental expense recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 associated with the actual
results for the nine-month period, as described below. 

As disclosed in footnote 5, during the three months ended September
30, 2016, the Company initiated a plan to sell its German subsidiary, AHN Biotechnologie GmbH. As a result, the Company determined
that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at AHN would not be realized and therefore recorded a valuation allowance
of $0.6 million to offset deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities. The decision was based on all available evidence,
including but not limited to the determination that previous tax planning strategies would no longer be feasible. 

Discrete items included in the tax expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 included the recording of a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of AHN, as well
as the impact of an enacted tax rate change on the net deferred tax assets of one of the Company s UK subsidiaries. Tax benefit
for the three months ended September 30, 2015 included non-deductible acquisition costs and a return to provision adjustment. 

Table of Contents     

Income tax was an approximately $0.9 million expense and $1.4 million
benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective income tax rate was (42.9%) for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with 42.3% for the same period in 2015. The tax rates for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 were based on actual results for the nine-month period rather than an effective tax rate estimated
for the entire year. The Company determined that using a year-to-date approach resulted in a better estimate of income tax expense
based on its forecast of pre-tax income, the mix of income across several jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates, and
the impact of the full valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. 

The difference between the Company s effective tax rate period
over period was primarily attributable to the mix of earnings between its domestic and foreign businesses, the impact of the full
valuation allowance against U.S deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2015, and the impact of a full valuation allowance
against the deferred tax assets of one of the Company s German subsidiaries recorded during the nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance
Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The update requires all deferred income taxes to be presented on the balance sheet
as noncurrent. The new guidance is intended to simplify financial reporting by eliminating the requirement to classify deferred
taxes between current and noncurrent. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early
adoption is permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
early adopted the new guidance on a prospective basis and has presented all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as
noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. Prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements
were not retrospectively adjusted. 

On October 26, 2016, the Company sold the operations of AHN, a manufacturer
of liquid handling products, located in Nordhausen, Germany, for $1.7 million. The results of operations and financial position
of AHN have been reported in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and balance sheet as of and for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016. In addition to the impairment loss recorded on the long-lived assets of AHN in the Company s
consolidated statement of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expects to record a loss on sale
in the range of approximately $0.8 million to $1.0 million within operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2016, due to the
allocation of goodwill and transaction costs associated with the sale. As of September 30, 2016, the major classes of assets and
liabilities of AHN, which were reported in the Company s consolidated balance sheet, were comprised of the following: 

(in thousands)  
 
     Assets    

Accounts receivable, net    
     $  349

Overview   

Harvard Bioscience, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a global developer,
manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of scientific instruments, systems and lab consumables used to advance life science
for basic research, drug discovery, clinical and environmental testing. Our products are sold to thousands of researchers in over
100 countries through our global sales organization, websites, catalogs, and through distributors including Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc., VWR, and other specialized distributors. We have sales and manufacturing operations in the United States, the United Kingdom,
Germany, Sweden, Spain, France, Canada, and China. 

At the end of 2013 we began a multiple year restructuring program
to reduce costs, align global functions, consolidate facilities, and reinvest in key areas such as sales and IT. As part of the
reinvestment, we initiated a multiple year plan in 2014 to invest in and implement a new global enterprise resource planning platform.
Additionally, during 2014, as part of the restructuring program, we initiated plans to relocate and consolidate the distribution,
finance and marketing operations of our Denville Scientific, Inc. subsidiary ( Denville Scientific ) to Charlotte,
North Carolina and our Holliston, MA headquarters, and relocate the manufacturing operations of our Biochrom Ltd. subsidiary ( Biochrom )
to our Holliston, MA headquarters. During the first quarter of 2015, we initiated plans to relocate the operations of our subsidiary,
Coulbourn Instruments, LLC ( Coulbourn ), to our Holliston, MA headquarters. During the second quarter of 2015, we
initiated plans to relocate the operations of HEKA Electronics Incorporated, our HEKA Canada subsidiary ( HEKA Canada ),
to HEKA Electronik Dr. Schulze GmbH, our HEKA Germany subsidiary ( HEKA Germany ). Also during the second quarter of
2015, and simultaneously with the HEKA Canada move, we initiated plans to relocate the operations of HEKA Instruments Incorporated,
our United States HEKA subsidiary ( HEKA U.S. , and together with HEKA Canada and HEKA Germany,  HEKA ),
to our Holliston, MA headquarters. As of December 31, 2015, these relocation plans had been completed. Additionally, we committed
to a restructuring plan on October 27, 2015, which included eliminating certain redundancies as a result of our site consolidations,
as well as a realignment of our commercial sales team. We believe the overall restructuring program positions us to stabilize,
focus on, and grow the life science business going forward.

During the third quarter of 2015, GE Healthcare informed us of its
decision to discontinue the sale of its spectrophotometer products by the end of 2015. This line of products includes the GE brands
NanoVue and SimpliNano, which we manufacture and distributed through GE. Since January 1, 2016, we have been selling the NanoVue
and SimpliNano spectrophotometers through our own direct sales force and through distribution partners, as well as servicing previously
sold products in the field, yielding a new source of revenue and higher gross margins. 

During the third quarter of 2016, we initiated plans to sell the
operations of our AHN Biotechnologie GmbH subsidiary ( AHN ), located in Nordhausen, Germany. AHN is a manufacturer
of liquid handling products which had revenues of $2.5 million in 2015. We concluded the sale of AHN in the fourth quarter of 2016,
for cash proceeds of $1.7 million. 

Our Strategy   

Our vision is to be a world leading life science company that excels
in meeting the needs of our customers by providing a wide breadth of innovative products and solutions, while providing exemplary
customer service. Our business strategy is to grow our top-line and bottom-line, and build shareholder value through a commitment
to: 

commercial excellence and organic growth;   

new product development;   

strategic acquisitions; and   

operational efficiencies.   

Components of Operating Income  

Revenues.      We generate revenues
by selling apparatus, instruments, devices and consumables through our distributors, direct sales force, websites and catalogs.
Our websites and catalogs serve as the primary sales tools for our Cell and Animal Physiology product line. This product line includes
both proprietary manufactured products and complementary products from various suppliers. Our reputation as a leading producer
in many of our manufactured products creates traffic to our website, enables cross-selling and facilitates the introduction of
new products. We have field sales teams in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Spain and China. In those regions
where we do not have a direct sales team, we use distributors. Revenues from direct sales to end users represented approximately
64% and 67% of our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, revenues from direct sales to end users represented approximately 63% and 64% of our revenues, respectively. 

Products in our Molecular Separation and Analysis product line
are generally sold by distributors, and are typically priced in the range of $5,000-$15,000. They are mainly scientific
instruments like spectrophotometers and plate readers that analyze light to detect and quantify a wide range of molecular and
cellular processes, or apparatus like gel electrophoresis units. We also use distributors for both our catalog products and
our higher priced products, as well as for sales in locations where we do not have subsidiaries or where we have existing
distributors in place from acquired businesses. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 36% and
33% of our total revenues, respectively, were derived from sales to distributors. For the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, approximately 37% and 36% of our total revenues, respectively, were derived from sales to distributors. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately
60% and 61% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from products we manufacture, approximately 14% for both periods, were
derived from complementary products we distribute in order to provide the researcher with a single source for all equipment needed
to conduct a particular experiment, and approximately 26% and 25%, respectively, were derived from distributed products sold under
our brand names. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, approximately 60% and 61% of our revenues, respectively,
were derived from products we manufacture, approximately 12% and 13%, respectively, were derived from complementary products we
distribute in order to provide the researcher with a single source for all equipment needed to conduct a particular experiment,
and approximately 28% and 26%, respectively, were derived from distributed products sold under our brand names. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately
36% and 35% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from sales made by our non-United States operations. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 38% and 40% of our revenues, respectively, were derived from sales made by our
non-United States operations. 

Table of Contents     

Changes in the relative proportion of our revenue sources between
direct sales and distribution sales are primarily the result of a different sales proportion of acquired companies and changes
in geographic mix. 

Cost of revenues.      Cost of revenues
includes material, labor and manufacturing overhead costs, obsolescence charges, packaging costs, warranty costs, shipping costs
and royalties. Our cost of revenues may vary over time based on the mix of products sold. We sell products that we manufacture
and products that we purchase from third parties. The products that we purchase from third parties typically have a higher cost
of revenues as a percent of revenues because the profit is effectively shared with the original manufacturer. We anticipate that
our manufactured products will continue to have a lower cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues as compared with the cost
of non-manufactured products for the foreseeable future. Additionally, our cost of revenues as a percent of revenues will vary
based on mix of direct to end user sales and distributor sales, mix by product line and mix by geography. 

Sales and marketing expenses.      Sales
and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel in sales, marketing and customer support
functions. We also incur costs for travel, trade shows, demonstration equipment, public relations and marketing materials, consisting
primarily of the printing and distribution of our catalogs, supplements and the maintenance of our websites. We may from time to
time expand our marketing efforts by employing additional technical marketing specialists in an effort to increase sales of selected
categories of products. We may also from time to time expand our direct sales organizations in an effort to concentrate on key
accounts or promote certain product lines. 

General and administrative expenses.      General
and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive, finance, accounting,
information technology and human resource functions. Other costs include professional fees for legal and accounting services, information
technology infrastructure, facility costs, investor relations, insurance and provision for doubtful accounts. 

Research and development expenses.      Research
and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel and spending to develop and enhance our
products. Other research and development expense includes fees for consultants and outside service providers, and material costs
for prototype and test units. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Grants received from governmental entities
related to research projects are accounted for as a reduction in research and development expense over the period of the project.
We believe that investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue to make these investments in
order to realize the potential of new technologies that we develop, license or acquire for existing markets. 

Restructuring charges.      Restructuring
charges consist of severance, other personnel-related charges and exit costs related to plans to create organizational efficiencies
and reduce operating expenses. 

Stock-based compensation expenses.      Stock-based
compensation expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.9 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Stock-based
compensation expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $2.6 million and $2.0 million, respectively. The
stock-based compensation expense related to stock options, restricted stock units, restricted stock units with a market condition
and the employee stock purchase plan and was recorded as a component of cost of revenues, sales and marketing expenses, general
and administrative expenses and research and development expenses. 

Bookings and Backlog   

We monitor bookings and backlog as these are indicators of future
revenues and business activity levels. 

Bookings were $26.3 million and $27.3 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the effects of currency translation, our bookings decreased $0.4 million,
or 1.3% from the three months ended September 30, 2015. Bookings were $77.0 million and $81.6 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the effects of currency translation, our bookings decreased $3.5 million or
4.3%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Our order backlog was approximately $7.5 million and $8.2 million
as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Excluding the effects of currency translation, our backlog decreased $0.4 million,
or 4.8% from September 30, 2015. We include in backlog only those orders for which we have received valid purchase orders. Purchase
orders may be cancelled at any time prior to shipment. Our backlog as of any particular date may not be representative of actual
sales for any succeeding period.

Selected Results of Operations  

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 compared to Three Months Ended September
30, 2015   

Each reporting period, we face currency exposure that arises from
translating the results of our worldwide operations to the United States dollar at exchange rates that fluctuate from the beginning
of such period. We evaluate our results of operations on both a reported and a foreign currency-neutral basis, which excludes the
impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We believe that disclosing this non-GAAP financial information provides
investors with an enhanced understanding of the underlying operations of the business. This non-GAAP financial information approximates
information used by our management to internally evaluate our operating results. The non-GAAP financial information provided below
should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, the financial information provided and presented in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. 

Revenues    

Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $25.0
million, a decrease of approximately 2.8%, or $0.7 million, compared to revenues of $25.7 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015.   

The decrease in revenues was primarily driven by currency fluctuations.
The impact of currency translation amounted to approximately $0.7 million, in lower revenues during the three months ended September
30, 2016.

Cost of revenues were $13.3 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 4.9%, compared with $14.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross
profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 46.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 45.6%
for 2015. The increase in gross profit margin was due to the savings associated with the relocation and consolidation of certain
facilities in 2015.

Sales and marketing expenses   

Sales and marketing expenses were $5.0 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 which was flat compared to the same period in 2015. 

General and administrative expenses   

General and administrative expenses were $4.8 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 4.1%, compared with $5.0 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of our restructuring activities as well as currency translation, partially
offset by higher stock compensation expense and audit costs. 

Research and development expenses    

Research and development expenses were $1.3 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 8.2%, compared with $1.4 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in expense was primarily as a result of the impact of currency fluctuations as well as an increase in the
amount of research grants earned, which are accounted for as a reduction in research and development expense, quarter over quarter. 

Restructuring    

Restructuring charges were immaterial for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 compared with $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Restructuring charges during the three
months ended September 30, 2015 related to plans commenced during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The 2014 restructuring plan realigned global operations and included actions to move the Biochrom manufacturing and Denville
Scientific distribution operations to Holliston, MA and Charlotte, NC, respectively. The 2015 restructuring plans included actions
to move the Coulbourn Instruments  operations to Holliston, MA and the HEKA Canada operations to HEKA Germany. 

Amortization of intangible assets   

Amortization of intangible asset expenses was $0.7 million for both
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Impairment charges   

Impairment charges were $0.7 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, we initiated plans to sell the operations of AHN. As a result of initiating
the plan to sell the operations of AHN, we evaluated the long-lived assets for impairment, pursuant to ASC 360-10. Based on the
resulting impairment analysis, we recognized an impairment charge of $0.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Other expense, net   

Other expense, net, was $0.1 million and $0.3 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Included in other expense, net for three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 was interest expense of $0.1 million and $0.2 million, respectively. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily
due to a decrease in interest expense and acquisition related costs, including due diligence. Acquisition related costs for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 were immaterial, compared to $0.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations included as a component of net loss resulted in approximately $0.1 million in currency gains
during both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

Income taxes    

Income tax was an approximately $0.8 million expense and a $0.2
million benefit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The tax expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 reflects the incremental expense recorded for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 associated with the actual
results for the nine-month period. Refer to the selected results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for
further details. Discrete items included in the tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 included the recording
of a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets of one of our German subsidiaries, as well as the impact of an
enacted tax rate change on the net deferred tax assets of one of our UK subsidiaries. Tax benefit for the three months ended September
30, 2015 included non-deductible acquisition costs and a return to provision adjustment.

Revenues    

Revenues decreased 2.7%, or $2.2 million to $78.1 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to revenues of $80.3 million for the same period in 2015. Excluding the effects of
currency translation, our revenues decreased 1.2% from the previous nine months. The decrease was primarily the result of softness
in the European funding environment and slower than expected NIH budget funding.

margin as a percentage of revenues increased to 46.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 44.6% for 2015.
The increase in gross profit margin was due to a decrease in purchase accounting fair value step-up charges for inventory recorded
in 2015, as well as the savings associated with the relocation and consolidation of certain facilities in 2015.

Sales and marketing expenses   

Sales and marketing expenses decreased $0.2 million, or 1.0%, to
$15.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $15.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The decrease was primarily the result of currency translation. 

General and administrative expenses   

General and administrative expenses increased $1.2 million, or 8.3%,
to $16.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $14.8 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The increase was primarily due to the forensic investigation costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016
related to the previously disclosed embezzlement at one of our subsidiaries in 2015 and higher stock compensation expense, partially
offset by the impact of our restructuring activities and currency translation. 

Research and development expenses    

Research and development expenses were $4.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 13.3%, compared with $4.9 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of our restructuring activities, currency translation, and an increase in
the amount of research grants earned, which are accounted for as a reduction in research and development expense, period over period. 

Restructuring    

Restructuring charges were immaterial for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared with $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Restructuring charges during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 included additional charges related to a 2014 restructuring plan as well as charges related to
two restructuring plans we implemented during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The 2014 restructuring plan realigned global
operations and included actions to move the Biochrom manufacturing and Denville Scientific distribution operations to Holliston,
MA and Charlotte, NC, respectively. The 2015 restructuring plans included actions to move the Coulbourn and operations to Holliston,
MA and the HEKA Canada operations to HEKA Germany. 

Amortization of intangible assets   

Amortization of intangible asset expenses was $2.1 million for both
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

Impairment charges   

Impairment charges were $0.7 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, we initiated plans to sell the operations of AHN. As a result of initiating the plan
to sell the operations of AHN, we evaluated the long-lived assets for impairment, pursuant to ASC 360-10. Based on the resulting
impairment analysis, we recognized an impairment charge of $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Other expense, net   

Other expense, net, was $0.2 million and $1.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily due to a decrease in acquisition
related costs, including due diligence and deal investigative activities, interest expense, and currency exchange rate fluctuations.
Acquisition related costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were immaterial compared to $0.9 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense was $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.6 million
in interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in interest expense of $0.1 million was due to lower
debt balances as a result of payment of principal. Currency exchange rate fluctuations included as a component of net loss resulted
in approximately $0.4 million and $0.2 million in currency gains during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Income taxes    

Income tax expense was approximately a $0.9 million expense and
a $1.4 million benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective income tax rate was (42.9%)
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with 42.3% for the same period in 2015. The tax rates for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were based on actual results for the nine-month period rather than an effective
tax rate estimated for the entire year. We determined that using a year-to-date approach resulted in a better estimate of income
tax expense based on our updated forecasts of pre-tax income, mix of income across several jurisdictions with different statutory
tax rates as well as the impact of the full valuation allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets. 

The difference between our effective tax rate period over period
was attributable to the mix of earnings between our domestic and foreign businesses as well as the impact of the full valuation
allowance against U.S. deferred tax assets recorded as of December 31, 2015, as well as the impact of a full valuation allowance
against the deferred tax assets of one of our German subsidiaries recorded as of nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

Historically, we have financed our business through cash provided
by operating activities, the issuance of common stock, and bank borrowings. Our liquidity requirements arise primarily from investing
activities, including funding of acquisitions, and other capital expenditures. As previously discussed, on January 8, 2015, we
acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of HEKA, a manufacturer with operations in Germany and Canada for approximately
$4.5 million, net of cash acquired. We funded the acquisition from our existing cash balances by utilizing approximately $5.9 million
of our foreign cash on hand. 

As of September 30, 2016, we held cash and cash equivalents of $5.3
million, compared with $6.7 million at December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $15.0 million
and $18.7 million, respectively, of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, net of deferred financing costs. Total debt,
net of cash and cash equivalents was $9.7 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $12.0 million at December 31, 2015. In addition,
we had an underfunded United Kingdom pension liability of approximately $2.5 million and $2.8 million at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents
held by our foreign subsidiaries was $3.1 million and $5.7 million, respectively. Funds held by our foreign subsidiaries are not
available for domestic operations unless the funds are repatriated. If we planned to or did repatriate these funds, then United
States federal and state income taxes would have to be recorded on such amounts. Our reinvestment determination is based on the
future operational and capital requirements of our U.S. and non-U.S. operations. As of December 31, 2015, we determined that
the assertion of permanent reinvestment at our foreign subsidiaries in Canada and France was no longer appropriate and we repatriated
approximately $3.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The total tax liability associated with the repatriation
of undistributed earnings in Canada and France was approximately $1.2 million, however it is anticipated that any taxable income
generated by the repatriation will be offset by the use of carried forward net operating losses. We currently have no plans to
repatriate any of our undistributed foreign earnings in any other countries outside of Canada and France. These balances are considered
permanently reinvested and will be used for foreign items including foreign acquisitions, capital investments, pension obligations
and operations. It is impracticable to estimate the total tax liability, if any, which would be created by the future distribution
of these earnings. 

We currently intend to retain all of our earnings to finance the
expansion and development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the
near future. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be a stockholder s sole source of gain for
the near future.

Our operating activities provided cash of $3.7 million and used
$1.1 million of cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cash flows from operations
was primarily due to changes in working capital and other adjustments to operating cash flows partially offset by forensic investigation
costs incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the previously disclosed embezzlement at one of our subsidiaries
in 2015. 

Our investing activities used cash of $1.0 million and $6.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Investing activities during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 primarily included cash used for purchases of property, plant and equipment. Investing activities during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 included cash used for acquisitions net of cash acquired and purchases of property, plant and equipment.
Additionally, in January 2015, we acquired HEKA for approximately $4.5 million, net of cash acquired. We spent $0.9 million and
$2.3 million on capital expenditures during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in capital
expenditures period over period was due primarily to the capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related
to the capital spend to relocate our Denville distribution business and UK manufacturing operations to North Carolina and Holliston,
MA, respectively. 

Our financing activities have historically consisted of borrowings
and repayments under our revolving credit facility and term loans, payments of debt issuance costs and the issuance of common stock.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, financing activities used cash of $3.7 million, compared with $0.6 million of
cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we borrowed $3.0 million under our credit facility, repaid $6.7 million of debt under our credit facility and term loans
and ended the quarter with $15.0 million of borrowings, net of deferred financing costs of $0.1 million. Net proceeds from the
issuance of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $0.1 million, which related to the exercise of stock
options and vesting of restricted stock units. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we borrowed $4.8 million under
our credit facility, repaid $6.1 million of debt under our credit facility and term loans and ended with $20.2 million of borrowings
at September 30, 2015. Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $2.0 million,
which related to the exercise of stock options. 

Borrowing Arrangements    

On August 7, 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated
Revolving Credit Loan Agreement related to a $20.0 million revolving credit facility with Bank of America, as agent, and Bank of
America and Brown Brothers Harriman   Co as lenders (as amended, the  2009 Credit Agreement ). Between September
2011, and June 2016, we entered into six amendments that among other things extended the maturity date of the credit facility;
reduced interest rates; converted existing loan advances into a term loan in the principal amount of $15.0 million (the  Term
Loan ); provided a revolving credit facility in the maximum principal amount of $25.0 million ( Revolving Line );
provided a delayed draw term loan of up to $10.0 million (the  DDTL ); amended the principal payment amortization of
the Term Loan and DDTL to five years, as well as amended our quarterly minimum fixed charge coverage financial covenant.

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,  Interest
- Imputation of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . Under this guidance, debt issuance costs related
to a recognized debt liability should be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that
debt liability. The provisions of this guidance are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this guidance during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2015, included in these consolidated financial statements, reflects a restatement to reclassify unamortized
deferred financing costs of approximately $0.2 million from other long-term assets to long-term debt. For deferred financing costs
paid to secure long-term debt, we have made a policy election to present such costs as a direct deduction from the debt liability
on the consolidated balance sheet. 

At September 30, 2016, the weighted effective interest rates on
the Term Loan, DDTL and Revolving Line borrowings were 3.96%, 3.60% and 2.77%, respectively. The Credit Agreement includes covenants
relating to income, debt coverage and cash flow, as well as minimum working capital requirements. The Credit Agreement also contains
limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and requires lender approval for acquisitions funded with cash, promissory
notes and/or other consideration in excess of $6.0 million and for acquisitions funded solely with equity in excess of $10.0 million.
As of September 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial covenants contained in the Credit Agreement; we were subject
to covenant and working capital borrowing restrictions, and had available borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement of $7.8
million. 

Our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources
will be adequate to support our operations is a forward-looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties, and actual results
could vary as a result of a number of factors. Based on our current operations and current operating plans, we expect that our
available cash, cash generated from current operations and debt capacity will be sufficient to finance current operations, any
potential future acquisitions and capital expenditures for the next 12 months and beyond. This may involve incurring additional
debt or raising equity capital for our business. Additional capital raising activities will dilute the ownership interests of existing
stockholders to the extent we raise capital by issuing equity securities and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in
raising additional capital on favorable terms or at all. 

Critical Accounting Policies   

The critical accounting policies underlying the accompanying unaudited
consolidated financial statements are those set forth in Part II, Item 7 included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016. 

Impact of Foreign Currencies   

Our international operations in some instances operate in a natural
hedge as we sell our products in many countries and a substantial portion of our revenues, costs and expenses are denominated in
foreign currencies, especially the British pound sterling, the Euro, the Canadian dollar and the Swedish krona. 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the U.S dollar s
strengthening in relation to the British pound sterling resulted in an unfavorable translation effect on our consolidated revenues
and our consolidated net loss. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an unfavorable effect on revenues of approximately
$1.2 million and a favorable effect on expenses of approximately $1.1 million. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
changes in foreign currency exchange rates resulted in an unfavorable effect on revenues of $3.1 million and a favorable effect
on expenses of $2.8 million. 

The loss associated with the translation of foreign equity into U.S.
dollars included as a component of comprehensive loss during the three months ended September 30, 2016, was approximately $2.0
million, compared to a loss of $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the loss associated with the translation of foreign equity into U.S. dollars included as a component of comprehensive
loss, was approximately $1.4 million, compared to a loss of $3.3 million during the same period in 2015. 

In addition, currency exchange rate fluctuations included as a component
of net loss resulted in approximately $0.1 million in currency gains during both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. Currency exchange rate fluctuations included as a component of net loss resulted in approximately $0.4 million and $0.2 million
in currency gains during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued
Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers,   a new accounting standard
that provides for a comprehensive model to use in the accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers that will replace
most existing revenue recognition guidance within accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under this standard,
revenue will be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. At its July 2015 meeting, the FASB agreed to defer the
mandatory effective date of ASU 2014-09 one year. Under the one year deferral, the standard will take effect in 2018 for calendar
year-end public entities. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Simplifying
Measurement of Inventory . The update requires measurement of most inventory  at the lower of cost and net realizable
value , and applies to all entities that recognize inventory within the scope of ASC 330, except for inventory measured under
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the retail inventory method (RIM). ASU 2015-11 requires prospective application and represents
a change in accounting principle. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early
adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which
is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions. The update requires a lessee to record on the balance sheet
the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by lease terms of more than 12 months. The update is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation  
Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , which simplifies the accounting for
share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities
and classification on the statement of cash flows. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and
early adoption is permitted. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments
  Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of credit losses on Financial Instruments.  The update amends the FASB s
guidance on the impairment of financial instruments. The ASU adds to U.S. GAAP an impairment model (known as the current expected
credit loss (CECL) model) that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes
as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such
losses. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal
years. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Classification of
Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230)  which amends ASC 230,  Statement of Cash Flows  to add or clarify
guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. 

We are evaluating the impact of each of ASU 2014-09, ASU 2015-11,
ASU 2016-02, ASU 2016-09, ASU 2016-13 and ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements. 

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation
of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . Under this guidance, debt issuance costs related to a recognized
debt liability should be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability.
The provisions of this guidance are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2015. We adopted this guidance during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The consolidated balance sheet as
of December 31, 2015, included in these consolidated financial statements, reflects a restatement to reclassify unamortized deferred
financing costs of approximately $0.2 million from other long-term assets to long-term debt. For deferred financing costs paid
to secure long-term debt, we have made a policy election to present such costs as a direct deduction from the debt liability on
the consolidated balance sheet. 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,  Simplifying
the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments . The update eliminates the requirement to retrospectively adjust financial
statements for measurement-period adjustments that occur in periods after a business combination. Under the update, measurement-period
adjustments are to be calculated as if they were known at the acquisition date, but are recognized in the reporting period in which
they are determined. Additional disclosures are required about the impact on current-period earnings. ASU 2015-16 requires prospective
application to adjustments of provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. The update was effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2015.  We adopted this guidance during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The adoption
of ASU 2015-16 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Table of Contents     

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance
Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The update requires all deferred income taxes to be presented on the balance sheet
as noncurrent. The new guidance is intended to simplify financial reporting by eliminating the requirement to classify deferred
taxes between current and noncurrent. The update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early
adoption is permitted at the beginning of an interim or annual period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we early
adopted the new guidance on prospective basis and have presented all deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent
in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2016. Prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements were
not retrospectively adjusted. 

Item 3.       Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   

The majority of our manufacturing and testing of products occurs
in our facilities in the United States, Germany, Sweden and Spain. We sell our products globally through our distributors, direct
sales force, websites and catalogs. As a result, our financial results are affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency
exchange rates and weak economic conditions in foreign markets. 

We collect amounts representing a substantial portion of our revenues
and pay amounts representing a substantial portion of our operating expenses in foreign currencies. As a result, changes in currency
exchange rates from time to time may affect our operating results. 

We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates primarily
through our financing activities. As of September 30, 2016, we had $15.0 million outstanding under our Credit Agreement, net of
deferred financing costs. 

Prior to the Third Amendment, borrowings under the Term Loan and
the DDTL accrued interest at a rate based on either the effective London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) for certain interest periods
selected by us, or a daily floating rate based on the BBA LIBOR as published by Reuters (or other commercially available source
providing quotations of BBA LIBOR), plus in either case, a margin of 3.0%. Prior to the Third Amendment, the Revolving Line accrued
interest at a rate based on either the effective LIBOR for certain interest periods selected by us, or a daily floating rate based
on the BBA LIBOR, plus in either case, a margin of 2.5%. We were required to fix the rate of interest on at least 50% of the Term
Loan and the DDTL through the purchase of an interest rate swap. The Term Loan and DDTL each have interest payments due at the
end of the applicable LIBOR period, or monthly with respect to BBA LIBOR borrowings, and principal payments are due quarterly.
The Revolving Line has interest payments due at the end of the applicable LIBOR period, or monthly with respect to BBA LIBOR borrowings.
Effective June 5, 2013, we entered into an interest rate swap contract with an original notional amount of $15.0 million and a
maturity date of March 29, 2018 in order to hedge the risk of changes in the effective benchmark interest rate (LIBOR) associated
with our Term Loan. The swap contract converted specific variable-rate debt into fixed-rate debt and fixed LIBOR associated with
the Term Loan at 0.96% plus a bank margin of 3.0%. Effective November 29, 2013, we entered into a second interest rate swap contract
with an original notional amount of $5.0 million and a maturity date of March 29, 2018 in order to hedge the risk of changes in
LIBOR associated with a portion of our DDTL. The swap contract converted specific variable-rate debt into fixed rate debt and fixed
LIBOR associated with half of the DDTL amount at 0.93% plus a bank margin of 3.0%. The notional amount of our derivative instruments
as of September 30, 2016 was $6.5 million. These swap contracts were associated with reducing or eliminating interest rate risk
and were designated as cash flow hedge instruments in accordance with ASC 815. We use interest-rate-related derivative instruments
to manage our exposure related to changes in interest rates on our variable-rate debt instruments. We do not enter into derivative
instruments for any purpose other than cash flow hedging and we do not speculate using derivative instruments. 

On April 24, 2015, we entered the Third Amendment which extended
the maturity date of the Revolving Line to March 29, 2018 and reduced the interest rate to the London Interbank Offered Rate plus
2.25%, 2.75% and 2.75% on the Revolving Line, Term Loan and DDTL, respectively. 

As of September 30, 2016, the weighted effective interest rates,
net of the impact of our interest rate swaps, on our Term Loan , DDTL and Revolving Line borrowings were 3.96%, 3.60% and 2.77%,
respectively. Assuming no other changes which would affect the margin of the interest rate under our Term Loan, DDTL and Revolving
Line, the effect of interest rate fluctuations on outstanding borrowings under our Credit Agreement as of September 30, 2016 over
the next twelve months is quantified and summarized as follows: 

Table of Contents     

Item 4.       Controls and Procedures.   

Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial
Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

As required by Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)
under the Exchange Act, our management, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of September 30, 2016. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information
required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and our management necessarily was required
to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing our disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon the evaluation described
above, our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures for the periods covered by this report were not effective,
as of September 30, 2016, because of the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting described in Part II,
Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016 (the  2015
Form 10-K ). Management has concluded that the material weaknesses that were present at December 31, 2015 were also present
at September 30, 2016. 

Notwithstanding the assessment that our internal
controls over financial reporting were not effective and that there were material weaknesses as identified in the 2015 Form 10-K,
we believe that our financial statements contained in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September
30, 2016, fairly present our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in all material respects. 

As previously disclosed in the 2015 Form 10-K,
to remediate the material weaknesses described under the subheading  Management s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting  in Item 9A of the 2015 Form 10-K, we plan to implement the remediation initiatives described under the subheading
 Remediation Plan  in Item 9A of the 2015 Form 10-K and will continue to evaluate the remediation and may in the future
implement additional measures. 

We continue to take actions and make progress towards remediating
the material weaknesses related to our internal control over financial reporting, as described above and in our 2015 Form 10-K.
We have allocated additional resources, both internal and external, as part of our remediation plans and have taken substantial
steps in designing and implementing controls to remediate the material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting .
 However, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1A.       Risk Factors.   

To our knowledge, except as set forth below, and except to the extent
additional factual information disclosed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates to such risk factors, there has been no
material changes in the risk factors described in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016, as amended by the risk factors described in  Item
1A. Risk Factors  in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the period ended June 30, 2016, which was filed with the SEC on
August 4, 2016.
