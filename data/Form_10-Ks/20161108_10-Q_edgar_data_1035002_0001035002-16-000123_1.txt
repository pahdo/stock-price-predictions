    BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
       
  Basis of Presentation 
  As used in this report, the terms  Valero,   we,   us,  or  our  may refer to Valero Energy Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole. 
    
  These unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. Financial information for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   included in these Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is derived from our unaudited financial statements. Operating results for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 
    
  The balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from our audited financial statements as of that date. For further information, refer to our financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Reclassifications 
  Certain amounts reported as of   December 31, 2015   have been reclassified in order to conform to the 2016 presentation, including the retrospective adoption of certain amendments to the Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of the amendments to ASC Subtopic 835-30,  Interest Imputation of Interest,  resulted in the reclassification of certain debt issuance costs from  deferred charges and other assets, net  to  debt and capital lease obligations, less current portion.  The adoption of the amendments to ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes  resulted in the reclassification of current deferred income tax assets and current deferred income tax liabilities to noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities. The following table presents our previously reported balance sheet line items retrospectively adjusted for the adoption of these pronouncements (in millions):

Significant Accounting Policies 
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, we review our estimates based on currently available information. Changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates. 
    
  Accounting Pronouncements Adopted During the Period 
  In February 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 810,  Consolidation,  were amended to improve consolidation guidance for certain types of legal entities. The guidance modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships. These provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. With the adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2016, we determined that Valero Energy Partners LP (VLP) is a VIE. Since we previously consolidated the financial statements of VLP, the adoption of this guidance did not affect our financial position or results of operations. See   Note 9   for disclosures related to our consolidated VIEs. 
    
  In April 2015, the provisions of ASC Subtopic 835-30,  Interest Imputation of Interest,  were amended to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires that debt issuance costs related to a note be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the face amount of that note, consistent with debt discounts, and that amortization of debt issuance costs be reported as interest expense. In August 2015, these provisions were further amended with guidance from the Securities and Exchange Commission staff, which provides that the staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. These provisions are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2016 did not materially affect our financial position and did not affect our results of operations because we already reported the amortization of debt issuance costs as interest expense. See  Basis of Presentation Reclassifications  above for the reclassified presentation in our balance sheet. Debt issuance costs associated with our line-of-credit arrangements will continue to be reported in the balance sheet as  deferred charges and other assets, net.  
    
  In May 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements,  were amended to remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The guidance also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient and limits those disclosures to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. These provisions are to be applied retrospectively and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2016 did not affect our financial position or results of operations.

  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

In September 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations,  were amended to simplify the accounting and reporting of adjustments made to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination. The amendment requires that an acquirer (i) record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date and (ii) present separately on the statement of income or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. These provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those annual periods, and should be applied prospectively to adjustments made to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2016 did not affect our financial position or results of operations; however, it may result in changes to the manner in which adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a future business combination, if any, are presented in our financial statements. 
    
  In November 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes,  were amended to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The amendments are effective for financial statements for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted as of the beginning of any interim or annual period. The amendments may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. Entities applying the guidance retrospectively should disclose in the first interim and first annual period of adoption the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle and quantitative information about the effects of the accounting change on prior periods. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted this guidance on a retrospective basis, but such adoption did not materially affect our financial position and it did not impact our results of operations. See  Basis of Presentation Reclassifications  above for the reclassified presentation. Adoption of this guidance simplifies the future presentation of our deferred income tax assets and liabilities. 
    
  In March 2016, the provisions of ASC Topic 718,  Compensation Stock Compensation,  were amended to simplify the accounting and reporting for employee share-based payments. These amendments involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including accounting for income taxes as it pertains to the recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the statements of income, forfeitures, minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid in the statement of cash flows. These provisions are effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The amendments provide specific transition and disclosure guidance for each provision. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted this guidance on a prospective basis, and such adoption did not materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Excess tax benefits, which were previously reported in cash flows from financing activities, are currently reported in cash flows from operating activities.

Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the ASC was amended and a new accounting standard, ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers,  was issued to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. The standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods. We have been evaluating and continue to evaluate the provisions of this standard and its impact on our business processes, business and accounting systems, and financial statements and related disclosures. A multi-disciplined implementation team has gained an understanding of the standard s revenue recognition model, is completing the review and documentation of our contracts, and is analyzing whether enhancements are needed to our business and accounting systems. 
    
  In July 2015, the provisions of ASC Topic 330,  Inventory  were amended to simplify the measurement of inventory measured using the first-in, first-out or average cost methods. These provisions are to be applied prospectively and are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2017 will not affect our financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In January 2016, the provisions of ASC Subtopic 825-10,  Financial Instruments Overall,  were amended to enhance the reporting model for financial instruments regarding certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure. These provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods. We are currently evaluating the effect that adopting this standard will have on our financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the ASC was amended and a new accounting standard, ASC Topic 842,  Leases,  was issued to increase the transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We have been evaluating and continue to evaluate the provisions of this standard and its impact on our business processes, business and accounting systems, and financial statements and related disclosures. A multi-disciplined implementation team has gained an understanding of the accounting and disclosure provisions of the standard and is in the process of analyzing the impacts to our business and accounting systems, including the development of new accounting systems to account for our leases and support the required disclosures. 
    
  In October 2016, the provisions of ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes,  were amended to improve the accounting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. The amendments require an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory immediately when the transfer occurs. These provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied on a modified retrospective basis with a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption for the recognition of income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory that occur before the adoption date. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2018 is not expected to materially affect our financial position or results of operations; however, certain deferred charges associated with intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory will be reported in our balance sheet primarily as a reduction to our deferred income tax liabilities.

In October 2016, the provisions of ASC Topic 810,  Consolidation,  were amended to provide guidance on how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity (VIE) should treat indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary. These provisions are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The amendments should be applied on a retrospective basis to all relevant prior periods beginning with the fiscal year in which the VIE guidance was adopted with a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The adoption of this guidance effective January 1, 2017 will not affect our financial position or results of operations. 

2. 
    ARUBA DISPOSITION 
       
  Effective October 1, 2016, we (i) transferred ownership of all of our assets in Aruba, other than certain hydrocarbon inventories and working capital, to Refineria di Aruba N.V. (RDA), an entity wholly-owned by the Government of Aruba (GOA), (ii) settled our obligations under various agreements with the GOA, including agreements that required us to dismantle our leasehold improvements under certain conditions, and (iii) sold the working capital of our Aruba operations, including hydrocarbon inventories, to the GOA, CITGO Aruba Refining N.V. (CAR), and CITGO Petroleum Corporation (together with CAR and certain other affiliates, collectively, CITGO). We refer to this transaction as the  Aruba Disposition.  The agreements associated with the Aruba Disposition were finalized in September 2016, including approval of such agreements by the Aruba Parliament. We no longer own any assets or have any operations in Aruba. 
    
  In June 2016, we recognized an asset impairment loss of   $56 million   representing all of the remaining carrying value of our long-lived assets in Aruba. These assets were primarily related to our crude oil and refined products terminal and transshipment facility in Aruba (collectively, the Aruba Terminal), which were included in our refining segment. We recognized the impairment loss at that time because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately transfer ownership of these assets to the GOA as a result of agreements entered into in June 2016 between the GOA and CITGO providing for, among other things, the GOA s lease of those assets to CITGO. (See   Note 12   for disclosure related to the method to determine fair value.) We had previously written off all of the carrying value of the long-lived assets of the refining operations (the Aruba Refinery) and recognized an asset retirement obligation upon the suspension of operations of those assets in 2012. Therefore, there was no other significant effect to our results of operations from the Aruba Disposition during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, except with respect to income taxes, which are discussed below. In addition, the net cash impact to us upon effectiveness of the Aruba Disposition on October 1, 2016, was not significant. 
    
  In September 2016 and in connection with the Aruba Disposition, our U.S. subsidiaries were unable to collect any outstanding debt obligations owed to them by our Aruba subsidiaries, which resulted in the recognition by us of an income tax benefit in the U.S. of   $42 million   during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We had no income tax effect in Aruba from the cancellation of debt or other effects of the Aruba Disposition because of net operating loss carryforwards associated with our operations in Aruba against which we had previously recorded a full valuation allowance.

    INVENTORIES 
       
  Inventories consisted of the following (in millions): 

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. As of   December 31, 2015  , we had a valuation reserve of   $766 million   in order to state our inventories at market. As of   September 30, 2016  , we reevaluated our inventories and determined that our cost was lower than market. As a result, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a change in our lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve that resulted in a net benefit to our results of operations of   $747 million  . The income statement benefit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   differs from the change in the balance sheet reserve due to the foreign currency effect of inventories held by our international operations. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the replacement cost (market value) of last-in, first-out (LIFO) inventories exceeded their LIFO carrying amounts by   $1.2 billion  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our non-LIFO inventories accounted for   $675 million   and   $668 million  , respectively, of our total inventories.

    DEBT AND CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATIONS 
       
  Credit Facilities 
  Revolver 
  We have a   $3 billion   revolving credit facility (the Revolver) that matures in   November 2020  . We have the option to increase the aggregate commitments under the Revolver to   $4.5 billion  , subject to certain conditions. The Revolver also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to   $2.0 billion  .   No   amounts were outstanding under the Revolver as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , and we had no borrowings under the Revolver during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  VLP Revolver 
  VLP has a   $750 million   senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the VLP Revolver) that matures in   November 2020  . The VLP Revolver is available only to the operations of VLP, and creditors of VLP do not have recourse against Valero. VLP has the option to increase the aggregate commitments under the VLP Revolver to   $1.0 billion  , subject to certain conditions. The VLP Revolver also provides for the issuance of letters of credit of up to   $100 million  . Outstanding borrowings under the VLP Revolver bear interest at a variable rate, which was   1.8125   percent as of   September 30, 2016  .

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , VLP borrowed   $139 million   and   $210 million   under the VLP Revolver in connection with VLP s acquisitions from us of the McKee Terminal Services Business in   April 2016   and the Meraux and Three Rivers Terminal Services Business in   September 2016  , respectively, and made   no   repayments under the VLP Revolver. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , VLP borrowed   $200 million   under the VLP Revolver in connection with VLP s acquisition from us of the Houston and St. Charles Terminal Services Business and repaid   $25 million   on the VLP Revolver. Borrowings outstanding under the VLP Revolver were   $524 million   and   $175 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Canadian Revolver 
  One of our Canadian subsidiaries has a   C$50 million   committed revolving credit facility (the Canadian Revolver) that matures in   November 2016  .   No   amounts were outstanding under the Canadian Revolver as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  , and we had no borrowings under the Canadian Revolver during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Accounts Receivable Sales Facility 
  We have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis. In July 2016, we amended our agreement to decrease the facility from   $1.4 billion   to   $1.3 billion   and extended the maturity date to   July 2017  . Proceeds from the sale of receivables under this facility are reflected as debt. Under this program, one of our marketing subsidiaries (Valero Marketing) sells eligible receivables, without recourse, to another of our subsidiaries (Valero Capital), whereupon the receivables are no longer owned by Valero Marketing. Valero Capital, in turn, sells an undivided percentage ownership interest in the eligible receivables, without recourse, to the third-party entities and financial institutions. To the extent that Valero Capital retains an ownership interest in the receivables it has purchased from Valero Marketing, such interest is included in our financial statements solely as a result of the consolidation of the financial statements of Valero Capital with those of Valero Energy Corporation; the receivables are not available to satisfy the claims of the creditors of Valero Marketing or Valero Energy Corporation. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we had no proceeds from or repayments under the accounts receivable sales facility.

Summary of Credit Facilities 
  We had outstanding borrowings, letters of credit issued, and availability under our revolving credit facilities as follows (in millions): 

___________________ 
           (a) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the actual availability under the accounts receivable sales facility fell below the facility borrowing capacity to   $1.2 billion   primarily due to a decrease in eligible trade receivables as a result of the current market price environment for the finished products that we produce. 
       
  Non-Bank Debt 
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued   $1.25 billion   of   3.4   percent senior notes due   September 15, 2026  . Proceeds from this debt issuance totaled   $1.246 billion  . We also incurred   $10 million   of debt issuance costs. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   repayments under our non-bank debt. 
    
  In October 2016, we redeemed our   6.125   percent senior notes with a maturity date of   June 15, 2017   for  $778 million  , or   103.70   percent of stated value, and our   7.2   percent senior notes with a maturity date of   October 15, 2017   for   $213 million  , or   106.27   percent of stated value.  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we issued   $600 million   of   3.65   percent senior notes due   March 15, 2025   and   $650 million   of   4.9   percent senior notes due   March 15, 2045  . Proceeds from these debt issuances totaled   $1.246 billion  . We also incurred   $12 million   of debt issuance costs. In addition, we made scheduled debt repayments of   $400 million   related to our   4.5   percent senior notes and   $75 million   related to our   8.75   percent debentures. 
    
  Other Debt 
  In June 2016, a joint venture in Canada that we consolidate entered into a   C$72 million   senior secured credit facility. This non-revolving credit facility bears interest at a fixed rate (as defined by the lender) plus the applicable margin and matures in   June 2023  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , borrowings under this facility totaled   C$72 million   and debt repayments totaled   C$2 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the effective interest rate of this facility was   3.85   percent.

Capitalized Interest 
  Capitalized interest was   $14 million   and   $18 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $53 million   and   $50 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Capital Lease Obligations 
  In October 2016, we entered into agreements under which we expect to lease storage tanks located at three of our refineries. The leases will not commence until certain required regulatory permitting occurs. The lease agreements will be accounted for as capital leases and we expect to recognize capital lease assets and related obligations of approximately   $490 million  . These capital lease agreements have initial terms of   10   years each and each agreement has successive   10  -year automatic renewal terms.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
       
  Environmental Matters 
  We are involved, together with several other companies, in an environmental cleanup in the Village of Hartford, Illinois (the Village) and during 2015, one of these companies assumed the ongoing remediation in the Village pursuant to a federal court order. We had previously conducted an initial response in the Village, along with other companies, pursuant to an administrative order issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The parties involved in the initial response may have further claims among themselves for costs already incurred. We also continue to be engaged in site assessment and interim measures at the adjacent shutdown refinery site, which we acquired as part of an acquisition in 2005, and we are in litigation with other potentially responsible parties and the Illinois EPA relating to the remediation of the site. In each of these matters, we have various defenses, limitations, and potential rights for contribution from the other responsible parties. We have recorded a liability for our expected contribution obligations. However, because of the unpredictable nature of these cleanups, the methodology for allocation of liabilities, and the State of Illinois  failure to directly sue third parties responsible for historic contamination at the site, it is reasonably possible that we could incur a loss in a range of   $0   to   $200 million   in excess of the amount of our accrual to ultimately resolve these matters. Factors underlying this estimated range are expected to change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from this estimate. 
    
  Litigation Matters 
  We are party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We have not recorded a loss contingency liability with respect to some of these matters because we have determined that it is remote that a loss has been incurred. For other matters, we have recorded a loss contingency liability where we have determined that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and that the loss is reasonably estimable. These loss contingency liabilities are not material to our financial position. We re-evaluate and update our loss contingency liabilities as matters progress over time, and we believe that any changes to the recorded liabilities will not be material to our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity.

Reconciliation of Balances 
  The following is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of equity attributable to our stockholders, equity attributable to noncontrolling interests, and total equity (in millions): 

___________________________   
           (a) 
    The noncontrolling interests relate to third-party ownership interests in VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary and therefore consolidate. See   Note 9   for information about our consolidated VIEs. 
              (b) 
     Transfers from noncontrolling interests, net of tax  reflects an adjustment to reallocate VLP equity activity between our ownership interest in VLP and that of the noncontrolling interests. This reallocation occurred due to the expiration of the subordination period on August 10, 2016 and as a result of a change in ownership interest resulting from VLP s issuances of equity following that date. During the subordination period, we held certain common units in VLP that were subordinate to other common units held by us and VLP s public unitholders. Upon expiration of the subordination period, all unitholders have equal ownership rights.

    VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES 
       
  In the normal course of business, we have financial interests in certain entities that have been determined to be VIEs. We consolidate a VIE when we have a variable interest in an entity for which we are the primary beneficiary such that we have (a) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. In order to make this determination, we evaluated our contractual arrangements with the VIEs, including arrangements for the use of assets, purchases of products and services, debt, equity, or management of operating activities. 
    
  The following discussion summarizes our involvement with our VIEs: 

VLP is a publicly traded master limited partnership whose common limited partner units are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under  VLP.  We formed VLP in July 2013 to own, operate, develop, and acquire crude oil and refined petroleum products pipelines, terminals, and other transportation and logistics assets. VLP s assets include crude oil and refined products pipeline and terminal systems in the U.S. Gulf Coast and U.S. Mid-Continent regions that are integral to the operations of   ten   of our refineries. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned a   66.6   percent limited partner interest and a   2   percent general partner interest in VLP, and public unitholders owned a   31.4   percent limited partner interest. 
       
  VLP was determined to be a VIE because the public limited partners of VLP (  i.e.  , parties other than entities under common control with the general partner) lack the power to direct the activities of VLP that most significantly impact its economic performance because they do not have substantive kick-out rights over the general partner or substantive participating rights in VLP. Furthermore, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of VLP because (a) we are the single decision maker and because our general partner interest provides us with the sole power to direct the activities that most significantly impact VLP s economic performance and (b) our   66.6   percent limited partner interest and   2   percent general partner interest provide us with significant economic rights and obligations. All of VLP s revenues are derived from us; therefore, there is limited risk to us associated with VLP s operations. 

Diamond Green Diesel Holdings LLC (DGD) is a joint venture with Darling Green Energy LLC, a subsidiary of Darling Ingredients Inc., that was formed to construct and operate a biodiesel plant that processes animal fats, used cooking oils, and other vegetable oils into renewable green diesel. The plant is located next to our St. Charles Refinery and began operations in June 2013. Our significant agreements with DGD include a debt agreement whereby we financed approximately   60   percent of the construction costs of the plant, an operations agreement that outlines our responsibilities as operator of the plant, and a marketing agreement. 
       
  In the event of certain conditions, the debt agreement provides us (as lender) with certain power to direct the activities that most significantly impact DGD s economic performance. Because the loan agreement conveys such power to us and is separate from our ownership rights, DGD was determined to be a VIE. For this reason and because we hold a   50   percent ownership interest that provides us with significant economic rights and obligations, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary  

20 

     Table of Contents  

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION 
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

of DGD. DGD has risk associated with its operations because it generates revenues from third-party customers. 

We also have financial interests in other entities in which we hold a   50   percent ownership interest, which is a significant variable interest. These entities were determined to be VIEs because the entities  contractual arrangements transfer the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact their economic performance or reduce the exposure to operational variability and risk of loss created by the entity that otherwise would be held exclusively by the equity owners. Furthermore, we determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs because (a) certain contractual arrangements (exclusive of our ownership rights) provide us with the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities and (b) our   50   percent ownership interests provide us with significant economic rights and obligations. The financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of these VIEs are not material to us. 
       
  The VIEs  assets can only be used to settle their own obligations and the VIEs  creditors have no recourse to our assets. We do not provide financial guarantees to our VIEs. Although we have provided credit facilities to the VIEs in support of their construction or acquisition activities, these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows are impacted by our consolidated VIEs  performance, net of intercompany eliminations, to the extent of our ownership interest in each VIE. 
    
  The following tables present summarized balance sheet information for the significant assets and liabilities of our VIEs, which are included in our balance sheets (in millions).

    SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION 
       
  In order to determine net cash provided by operating activities, net income is adjusted by, among other things, changes in current assets and current liabilities as follows (in millions): 

The above changes in current assets and current liabilities differ from changes between amounts reflected in the applicable balance sheets for the respective periods for the following reasons: 
             
    the amounts shown above exclude changes in cash and temporary cash investments, deferred income taxes, and current portion of debt and capital lease obligations; 

amounts accrued for capital expenditures and deferred turnaround and catalyst costs are reflected in investing activities when such amounts are paid; 

amounts accrued for common stock purchases in the open market that are not settled as of the balance sheet date are reflected in financing activities when the purchases are settled and paid; and 

certain differences between balance sheet changes and the changes reflected above result from translating foreign currency denominated balances at the applicable exchange rates as of each balance sheet date.

There were no significant noncash investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Noncash financing activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   included: 

a noncash transfer of   $68 million   between additional paid-in capital and noncontrolling interests for ownership changes in VLP, and the establishment of a   $25 million   deferred tax liability on the equity transfer. This noncash transaction is further described in   Note 6  . 
       
  Noncash investing and financing activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   included the recognition of a capital lease asset and related obligation associated with an agreement for storage tanks near one of our refineries. Noncash financing activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   also included an accrual of   $30 million   for the purchase of   506,100   shares of our common stock, which was settled in early October 2015. 
    
  Cash flows reflected as  other financing activities, net  for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   included the payment of a long-term liability of   $137 million   owed to a joint venture partner associated with an owner-method joint venture investment.

     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
       
  General 
  U.S. GAAP requires or permits certain assets and liabilities to be measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis in our balance sheets, and those assets and liabilities are presented below under    Recurring Fair Value Measurements    and    Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.    Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, such as derivative financial instruments, are measured at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as the impairment of property, plant and equipment, are measured at fair value in particular circumstances. 
    
  U.S. GAAP also requires the disclosure of the fair values of financial instruments when an option to elect fair value accounting has been provided, but such election has not been made. A debt obligation is an example of such a financial instrument. The disclosure of the fair values of financial instruments not recognized at fair value in our balance sheet is presented below under    Other Financial Instruments.  
    
  U.S. GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value and establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques based on the degree to which objective prices in external active markets are available to measure fair value. Following is a description of each of the levels of the fair value hierarchy. 

Level 1   - Observable inputs, such as unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2   - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 
                
    Level 3   - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions about what market participants would use to price the asset or liability. The inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances, which might include occasional market quotes or sales of similar instruments or our own financial data such as internally developed pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, as well as instruments for which the fair value determination requires significant judgment.

Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The tables below present information (in millions) about our assets and liabilities recognized at their fair values in our balance sheets categorized according to the fair value hierarchy of the inputs utilized by us to determine the fair values as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  We have elected to offset the fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty, including any related cash collateral assets or obligations as shown below; however, fair value amounts by hierarchy level are presented in the tables below on a gross basis. We have no derivative contracts that are subject to master netting arrangements that are reflected gross on the balance sheet.

A description of our assets and liabilities recognized at fair value along with the valuation methods and inputs we used to develop their fair value measurements are as follows: 
             
    Commodity derivative contracts consist primarily of exchange-traded futures and swaps, and as disclosed in   Note 13  , some of these contracts are designated as hedging instruments. These contracts are measured at fair value using the market approach. Exchange-traded futures are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Swaps are priced using third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services, and exchange-traded curves, with appropriate consideration of counterparty credit risk, but because they have contractual terms that are not identical to exchange-traded futures instruments with a comparable market price, these financial instruments are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
                
    Physical purchase contracts represent the fair value of fixed-price corn purchase contracts. The fair values of these purchase contracts are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices from the commodity exchange or an independent pricing service and are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
                
    Investments of certain benefit plans consist of investment securities held by trusts for the purpose of satisfying a portion of our obligations under certain U.S. nonqualified benefit plans. The assets categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy are measured at fair value using a market approach based on quoted prices from national securities exchanges. The assets categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy represent insurance contracts, the fair value of which is provided by the insurer.

VALERO ENERGY CORPORATION

Foreign currency contracts consist of foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts entered into for our international operations to manage our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than the local (functional) currencies of those operations. These contracts are valued based on quoted prices from the exchange and are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. 
                
    Environmental credit obligations represent our liability for the purchase of (i) biofuel credits (primarily Renewable Identification Numbers (RINs) in the U.S.) needed to satisfy our obligation to blend biofuels into the products we produce and (ii) emission credits under the California Global Warming Solutions Act (the California cap-and-trade system, also known as AB 32) and Quebec s   Regulation respecting the cap-and-trade system for greenhouse gas emission allowances   (the Quebec cap-and-trade system), (collectively, the cap-and-trade systems). To the degree we are unable to blend biofuels (such as ethanol and biodiesel) at percentages required under the biofuel programs, we must purchase biofuel credits to comply with these programs. Under the cap-and-trade systems, we must purchase emission credits to comply with these systems. These programs are further described in   Note 13   under  Environmental Compliance Program Price Risk.  The liability for environmental credits is based on our deficit for such credits as of the balance sheet date, if any, after considering any credits acquired or under contract, and is equal to the product of the credits deficit and the market price of these credits as of the balance sheet date. The environmental credit obligations are categorized in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and are measured at fair value using the market approach based on quoted prices from an independent pricing service. 
     There were no transfers between levels for assets and liabilities held as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 
    
  There was   no   activity during the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   related to the fair value amounts categorized in Level 3 as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  As discussed in   Note 2  , we concluded that the Aruba Terminal was impaired as of June 30, 2016, which resulted in an asset impairment loss of   $56 million   that was recorded in June 2016. The fair value of the Aruba Terminal was determined using an income approach and was classified in Level 3. We employed a probability-weighted approach to possible future cash flow scenarios, including transferring ownership of the business to the GOA or continuing to operate. 
    
  There were   no   assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Other Financial Instruments 
  Financial instruments that we recognize in our balance sheets at their carrying amounts are shown in the table below along with their associated fair values (in millions): 

The methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of these financial instruments are as follows: 
             
    The fair value of cash and temporary cash investments approximates the carrying value due to the low level of credit risk of these assets combined with their short maturities and market interest rates (Level 1). 
                
    The fair value of debt is determined primarily using the market approach based on quoted prices provided by third-party brokers and vendor pricing services (Level 2).

    PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 
       
  We are exposed to market risks primarily related to the volatility in the price of commodities, foreign currency exchange rates, and the price of credits needed to comply with various government and regulatory programs. We enter into derivative instruments to manage some of these risks, including derivative instruments related to the various commodities we purchase or produce, and foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts, as described below under    Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk.    These derivative instruments are recorded as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair values (see   Note 12  ), as summarized below under    Fair Values of Derivative Instruments,    with changes in fair value recognized currently in income. The effect of these derivative instruments on our income is summarized below under    Effect of Derivative Instruments on Income.    The cash flow effects of all of our derivative instruments are reflected in operating activities in our statements of cash flows for all periods presented. 
    
  Risk Management Activities by Type of Risk 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including futures, swaps, and options. We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our hedging and trading operations. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. 
    
  To manage commodity price risk, we use economic hedges, which are not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges, and we use fair value and cash flow hedges from time to time. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes. Our objectives for entering into hedges or trading derivatives are described below.

Economic Hedges     Economic hedges represent commodity derivative instruments that are used to manage price volatility in certain (i) feedstock and refined product inventories, (ii) fixed-price purchase contracts, and (iii) forecasted feedstock, refined product or natural gas purchases and refined product sales. The objectives of our economic hedges are to hedge price volatility in certain feedstock and refined product inventories and to lock in the price of forecasted feedstock, refined product, or natural gas purchases or refined product sales at existing market prices that we deem favorable. Economic hedges are not designated as fair value or cash flow hedges for accounting purposes, usually due to the difficulty of establishing the required documentation at the date the derivative instrument is entered into for them to qualify as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were used as economic hedges, as well as commodity derivative instruments related to the physical purchase of corn at a fixed price. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes in thousands of barrels, except those identified as corn contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels, and soybean oil contracts that are presented in thousands of pounds).

Trading Derivatives     Our objective for entering into commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes is to take advantage of existing market conditions for crude oil and refined products. 
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the following outstanding commodity derivative instruments that were entered into for trading purposes. The information presents the notional volume of outstanding contracts by type of instrument and year of maturity (volumes represent thousands of barrels, except those identified as corn contracts that are presented in thousands of bushels). 

We had no commodity derivative contracts outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015   or during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   that were designated as fair value or cash flow hedges. 
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  We are exposed to exchange rate fluctuations on transactions entered into by our international operations that are denominated in currencies other than the local (functional) currencies of those operations. To manage our exposure to these exchange rate fluctuations, we use foreign currency exchange and purchase contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and therefore are classified as economic hedges. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had forward contracts to purchase   $328 million   of U.S. dollars. These contracts matured on or before   October 31, 2016  . 
    
  Environmental Compliance Program Price Risk 
  We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory environmental compliance programs. To manage this risk, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. Certain of these programs require us to blend biofuels into the products we produce, and we are subject to such programs in most of the countries in which we operate. These countries set annual quotas for the percentage of biofuels that must be blended into the motor fuels consumed in these countries. As a producer of motor fuels from petroleum, we are obligated to blend biofuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least equal to the applicable quota. To the degree we are unable to blend at the applicable rate, we must purchase biofuel credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.). We are exposed to the volatility in the

  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 

market price of these credits, and we manage that risk by purchasing biofuel credits when prices are deemed favorable. The cost of meeting our obligations under these compliance programs was   $198 million   and   $94 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $532 million   and   $283 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. These amounts are reflected in cost of sales. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2015, we became subject to additional requirements under greenhouse gas emission programs, including the cap-and-trade systems, as discussed in   Note 12  . Under these cap-and-trade systems, we purchase various greenhouse gas emission credits available on the open market. Therefore, we are exposed to the volatility in the market price of these credits. The cost to implement certain provisions of the cap-and-trade systems are significant; however, we recovered the majority of these costs from our customers for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and expect to continue to recover the majority of these costs in the future. For the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the net cost of meeting our obligations under these compliance programs was immaterial. 
    
  Fair Values of Derivative Instruments 
  The following tables provide information about the fair values of our derivative instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in millions) and the line items in the balance sheets in which the fair values are reflected. See   Note 12   for additional information related to the fair values of our derivative instruments. 
    
  As indicated in   Note 12  , we net fair value amounts recognized for multiple similar derivative contracts executed with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements, including cash collateral assets and obligations. The tables below, however, are presented on a gross asset and gross liability basis, which results in the reflection of certain assets in liability accounts and certain liabilities in asset accounts.

Market and Counterparty Risk 
  Our price risk management activities involve the receipt or payment of fixed price commitments into the future. These transactions give rise to market risk, which is the risk that future changes in market conditions may make an instrument less valuable. We closely monitor and manage our exposure to market risk on a daily basis in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors. Market risks are monitored by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy. We do not require any collateral or other security to support derivative instruments into which we enter. We also do not have any derivative instruments that require us to maintain a minimum investment-grade credit rating.

    changes in the credit ratings assigned to our debt securities and trade credit; 
                
    changes in currency exchange rates, including the value of the Canadian dollar, the pound sterling, and the euro relative to the U.S. dollar;

    other factors generally described in the  Risk Factors  section included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   that is incorporated by reference herein. 
       
  Any one of these factors, or a combination of these factors, could materially affect our future results of operations and whether any forward-looking statements ultimately prove to be accurate. Our forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results and future performance may differ materially from those suggested in any forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update these statements unless we are required by the securities laws to do so. 
    
  All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any such forward-looking statements that may be made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. 
    
  This Form 10-Q includes references to financial measures that are not defined under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These non-GAAP financial measures include adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders, gross margin, and adjusted operating income. We have included these non-GAAP financial measures to help facilitate the comparison of operating results between periods. See the accompanying financial tables in  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  for a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures. In note (c) to the accompanying tables, we disclose the reasons why we believe our use of the non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK 

Overview 
  Third Quarter Results 
  In the   third quarter   of   2016  , we reported net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation (Valero) stockholders of   $613 million   compared to   $1.4 billion   in the   third quarter   of   2015  , which represents a decrease of   $764 million  . Excluding a   $42 million    (a)    tax benefit recognized in connection with the transfer of ownership of the Aruba Refinery and the Aruba Terminal to the Government of Aruba (GOA), adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders in the   third quarter   of   2016   was   $571 million  , representing a decrease of   $806 million   from the comparable 2015 period. The decrease in net income and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders is primarily due to lower operating income in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the third quarter of 2015 (net of the resulting decrease of   $513 million   in income tax expense between the two periods). Operating income decreased by   $1.2 billion  , as outlined by segment in the following table (in millions). 

The   $1.2 billion   decrease is due primarily to the following: 

Refining segment   - The   $1.3 billion   decrease in operating income was due primarily to lower margins on refined products and lower discounts on light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. This is more fully described on pages   50   and   51  . 
                
    Ethanol segment   - The   $71 million   increase in operating income was due primarily to higher ethanol margins that resulted from lower corn prices. This is more fully described on page   51  . 
       
  First Nine Months Results 
  For the first   nine   months of   2016  , we reported net income attributable to Valero stockholders of   $1.9 billion   compared to   $3.7 billion   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , which represents a decrease of   $1.8 billion  . 
    
  The results for the first   nine   months of   2016  , however, are impacted by (i) a noncash benefit of   $579 million    (b)    from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and (ii) a noncash charge of   $56 million    (a)    from an asset impairment loss related to our Aruba Terminal, as well as (iii) a tax benefit of   $42 million    (a)    recognized in connection with the transfer of ownership of the Aruba Refinery and Aruba Terminal to the GOA. Excluding the resulting   $565 million   net benefit to net income attributable to Valero stockholders, adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders for the first   nine   months of   2016   was   $1.4 billion  , which represents a decrease of   $2.3 billion   from the comparable 2015 period. 

38 

     Table of Contents  

The decrease in both net income and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders is due to lower operating income for the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   (net of the resulting decrease of   $1.1 billion   in income tax expense between the two periods). Operating income decreased by   $2.8 billion  , while adjusted operating income decreased by   $3.5 billion  , as outlined by segment in the following tables (in millions). 

The   $2.8 billion   decrease in operating income was positively impacted by the net effect of the adjustments discussed above for the lower of cost or market inventory valuation benefit and impairment loss. We have excluded such effects from adjusted operating income because we believe that these adjustments are not indicative of our core operating performance and may obscure the underlying business results and trends. The   $3.5 billion   decrease in adjusted operating income is due primarily to the following: 
             
    Refining segment   - The   $3.5 billion   decrease in adjusted operating income was due primarily to lower margins on refined products and lower discounts on light sweet crude oils relative to Brent crude oil. This is more fully described on pages   64   and   65  . 
                
    Ethanol segment   - The   $9 million   increase in adjusted operating income was due primarily to lower operating expenses, partially offset by lower margins on ethanol and other co-products. This is more fully described on pages   65   and   66  . 
       
  Additional Information and Non-GAAP Reconciliations 
  Additional details and analysis of the changes in the operating income and adjusted operating income of our business segments and other components of net income and adjusted net income attributable to Valero stockholders, including a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this Overview to their most comparable amounts reported under U.S. GAAP, are provided below under  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  beginning on page   41  .

Outlook 
  During the third quarter of 2016, margins were fairly stable, but they are trending lower thus far in the fourth quarter. Below is a summary of factors that may impact our results of operations during the fourth quarter of 2016: 
             
    Gasoline margins are expected to decline from current levels as gasoline demand follows typical seasonal patterns. 
                
    Distillate margins are expected to improve due to increased heating oil demand. 
                
    Crude oil discounts are expected to remain wide as crude oil production is expected to outpace demand. 
                
    Ethanol margins are expected to decline from current levels primarily due to the seasonal reduction in U.S. gasoline demand and thus domestic ethanol demand. 
                
    A decline in market prices of refined products may negatively impact the carrying value of our inventories.

General 
  Operating revenues decreased   $2.9 billion   (or   13   percent) and cost of sales decreased   $1.6 billion   (or   9   percent) in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively. Operating income decreased   $1.2 billion   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in refining segment operating income of   $1.3 billion  , partially offset by an increase in ethanol segment operating income of   $71 million  . The reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below. 
  Refining 
  Refining segment operating income decreased   $1.3 billion   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   primarily due to a   $1.4 billion   decrease in refining gross margin, partially offset by a   $31 million   decrease in operating expenses and a   $14 million   decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. 
    
  Refining gross margin decreased   $1.4 billion   (a   $5.31   per barrel decrease) in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  , due primarily to the following: 

Decrease in gasoline margins   - We experienced a decrease in gasoline margins in all of our regions in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  . For example, the WTI-based reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent CBOB gasoline was   $14.15   per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $22.71   per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $8.56   per barrel. Another example is the ANS-based reference margin for U.S. West Coast CARBOB 87 gasoline that was   $17.68   per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $31.59   per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $13.91   per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $750 million. 

Decrease in distillate margins   - We experienced a decrease in distillate margins in all of our regions in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015  . For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for North Atlantic ultra-low-sulfur diesel was   $11.52   per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $14.54   per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $3.02   per barrel. Another example is the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel was   $15.36   per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $20.36   per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $5.00   per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in distillate margins in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $320 million. 

Lower discounts on light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils   - The market prices for refined products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, and we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil, such as WTI crude oil, in periods when pricing terms are favorable. During the   third quarter   of   2016  , we benefited from processing WTI crude oil; however, that benefit declined when compared to the benefit from processing WTI crude oil during the   third quarter   of   2015  . For example, WTI crude oil processed in our U.S. Mid-Continent region sold at a discount of   $2.03   per barrel to Brent crude oil in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to a discount of   $4.73   per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $2.70   per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil (a type of sour crude oil) that sold at a discount of   $7.88   per barrel to Brent crude oil in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to a discount of   $8.48   per barrel in the   third quarter   of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $0.60   per barrel.We estimate that the cost of

     Table of Contents  

light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils in the   third quarter   of   2016   had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $180 million. 

Higher costs of biofuel credits   - As more fully described in   Note 13   of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we must purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) increased by   $104 million   from   $94 million   in the   third quarter   of   2015   to   $198 million   in   third quarter   of   2016  . This increase was due to an increase in the market price of RINs caused by an expected shortage in the market of available RINs. 
       
  The decrease of   $31 million   in operating expenses was primarily due to a $20 million decrease in employee-related expenses primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense. 
    
  The decrease of   $14 million   in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to $17 million of write-offs for projects that were cancelled during the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Ethanol 
  Ethanol segment operating income increased   $71 million   in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   primarily due to a   $64 million   (or   $0.19   per gallon) increase in gross margin and a   $9 million   reduction in operating expenses. 
    
  The increase in ethanol segment gross margin of   $64 million   was due primarily to the following: 

Lower corn prices   - Corn prices were lower in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to the   third quarter   of   2015   primarily due to higher forecasted yields from the current corn crop in the corn-producing regions of the U.S. Mid-Continent. For example, the Chicago Board of Trade corn price was   $3.32   per bushel in the   third quarter   of   2016   compared to   $3.83   per bushel in the   third quarter   of   2015  . We estimate that the decrease in the price of corn that we processed during the   third quarter   of   2016   had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $70 million. 

Lower co-product prices -   A decrease in export demand had an unfavorable effect on the prices we received for corn-related co-products, primarily distillers grains. We estimate that the decrease in distillers grain prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $8 million. 
       
  The   $9 million   decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $5 million decrease in chemical costs. 
    
  Other 
  Income tax expense decreased   $513 million   from the   third quarter   of   2015   to the   third quarter   of   2016   primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. The effective tax rates of   18   percent in the   third quarter   of   2016   and   32   percent in the   third quarter   of   2015   are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent because income from our international operations is taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in the   third quarter   of   2016   was also lower than the rate in the   third quarter   of   2015   due to (i) a benefit of   $42 million   associated with the transfer of ownership of the Aruba Refinery and Aruba Terminal to the GOA and (ii) a benefit of $35 million resulting from the settlement of an income tax audit. The transfer of ownership of the Aruba Refinery and Aruba Terminal to the GOA is more fully described in   Note 2   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following notes relate to references on pages   41   through   49   and pages   52   through   61  . 
           (a) 
    In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market. When the market price of our inventory falls below cost, we record a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment to write down the value to market. In subsequent periods, the value of our inventory is reassessed and a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment is recorded to reflect the net change in the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve between periods. As of   September 30, 2016  , the market price of our inventory was above cost; therefore, we did not have a lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve as of that date. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a change in our inventory valuation reserve that was established on   December 31, 2015  , resulting in a noncash benefit of   $747 million  , of which   $697 million   and   $50 million   were attributable to our refining segment and ethanol segment, respectively. This adjustment is further discussed in   Note 3   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
       
           (b) 
    Effective October 1, 2016, we (i) transferred ownership of all of our assets in Aruba, other than certain hydrocarbon inventories and working capital, to Refineria di Aruba N.V. (RDA), an entity wholly-owned by the GOA, (ii) settled our obligations under various agreements with the GOA, including agreements that required us to dismantle our leasehold improvements under certain conditions, and (iii) sold the working capital of our Aruba operations, including hydrocarbon inventories, to the GOA, CITGO Aruba Refining N.V. (CAR), and CITGO Petroleum Corporation (together with CAR and certain other affiliates, collectively, CITGO). We refer to this transaction as the  Aruba Disposition.  
       
  In June 2016, we recognized an asset impairment loss of   $56 million   representing all of the remaining carrying value of the long-lived assets of our crude oil and refined products terminal and transshipment facility in Aruba (collectively, the Aruba Terminal). We recognized the impairment loss at that time because we concluded that it was more likely than not that we would ultimately transfer ownership of these assets to the GOA as a result of agreements entered into in June 2016 between the GOA and CITGO for the GOA s lease of those assets to CITGO. There was no other significant effect to our results of operations from the Aruba Disposition during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, except with respect to income taxes, which are discussed below. In addition, the net cash impact to us upon effectiveness of the Aruba Disposition on October 1, 2016, was not significant. 
    
  In September 2016 and in connection with the Aruba Disposition, our U.S. subsidiaries were unable to collect any outstanding debt obligations owed to them by our Aruba subsidiaries, which resulted in the recognition by us of an income tax benefit in the U.S. of   $42 million   during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. We had no income tax effect in Aruba from the cancellation of debt or other effects of the Aruba Disposition because of net operating loss carryforwards associated with our operations in Aruba against which we had previously recorded a full valuation allowance. 
    
           (c) 
    We use certain financial measures (as noted below) that are not defined under U.S. GAAP and are considered to be non-GAAP measures. 
       
  We have defined these non-GAAP measures and believe they are useful to the external users of our financial statements, including industry analysts, investors, lenders, and rating agencies. We believe these measures are useful to assess our ongoing financial performance because, when reconciled to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures, they provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance and that may obscure our underlying business results and trends. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered as alternatives to their most comparable U.S. GAAP measures nor should they be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of our results of operations as reported under U.S. GAAP. In addition, these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies because we may define them differently, which diminishes the utility of these measures. 
    
  Non-GAAP measures are as follows: 
             
    Adjusted net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders   is defined as net income attributable to Valero Energy Corporation stockholders excluding the lower of cost or market inventory

valuation adjustment, its related income tax effect, the asset impairment loss, and the income tax benefit on the Aruba Disposition. 
             
    Gross margin   is defined as operating income excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment, operating expenses, depreciation and amortization expense, and asset impairment loss. 
                
    Adjusted operating income   is defined as operating income excluding the lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment and asset impairment loss. 
       
           (d) 
    The regions reflected herein contain the following refineries: the U.S. Gulf Coast region includes the Corpus Christi East, Corpus Christi West, Houston, Meraux, Port Arthur, St. Charles, Texas City, and Three Rivers Refineries; the U.S. Mid-Continent region includes the Ardmore, McKee, and Memphis Refineries; the North Atlantic region includes the Pembroke and Quebec City Refineries; and the U.S. West Coast region includes the Benicia and Wilmington Refineries. 
       
           (e) 
    Other products primarily include petrochemicals, gas oils, No. 6 fuel oil, petroleum coke, sulfur, and asphalt. 
       
           (f) 
    Throughput margin per barrel represents gross margin (as defined in (c) above) for our refining segment or refining regions divided by the respective throughput volumes. Gross margin per gallon of production represents gross margin (as defined in (c) above) for our ethanol segment divided by production volumes. Throughput and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables) by the number of days in the applicable period. 
       
           (g) 
    Operating income per barrel represents operating income for our refining segment or refining regions divided by the respective throughput volumes. Operating income per gallon of production represents operating income for our ethanol segment divided by production volumes. 
       
  Adjusted operating income per barrel represents adjusted operating income (defined in (c) above) for our refining segment or refining regions divided by the respective throughput volumes. Adjusted operating income per gallon represents adjusted operating income (defined in (c) above) for our ethanol segment divided by production volumes. Throughput and production volumes are calculated by multiplying throughput and production volumes per day (as provided in the accompanying tables) by the number of days in the applicable period. 
    
           (h) 
    Average market reference prices for LLS crude oil, along with price differentials between the price of LLS and other types of crude oils are reflected without adjusting for the impact of the futures pricing for the corresponding delivery month. Therefore, the prices reported reflect the prompt month pricing only, without an adjustment for futures pricing (known in industry as the Calendar Month Average (CMA)  roll  adjustment). We previously had provided average market reference prices that included the CMA  roll  adjustment. Accordingly, the average market reference price and price differentials for LLS crude oil for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   have been adjusted to conform to the current presentation. 
       
           (i) 
    Average market reference price differentials to Mars crude oil have been replaced by average market reference price differentials to Argus Sour Crude Index (ASCI). Mars crude oil is one of the three grades of sour crude oil used to create ASCI, and therefore, ASCI is a more comprehensive price marker for medium sour crude oil. Accordingly, the price differentials for ASCI crude oil for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   are included to conform to the current presentation. 
       
  General 
  Operating revenues decreased   $14.1 billion   (or   20   percent) and cost of sales decreased   $10.6 billion   (or   18   percent) in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   primarily due to a decrease in refined product prices and crude oil feedstock costs, respectively. Operating income decreased   $2.8 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in refining segment operating income of   $2.8 billion  , partially offset by an increase in ethanol segment operating income of   $59 million  . Adjusted operating income decreased   $3.5 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  , primarily due to a decrease in refining segment

adjusted operating income of   $3.5 billion  , partially offset by an increase in ethanol segment adjusted operating income of   $9 million  . The reasons for these changes in the operating results of our segments, as well as other items that affected our income, are discussed below. 
  Refining 
  Refining segment adjusted operating income decreased   $3.5 billion   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   primarily due to a   $3.5 billion   decrease in refining gross margin and a   $63 million   increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a   $97 million   decrease in operating expenses. 
  Refining gross margin decreased   $3.5 billion   (a   $4.87   per barrel decrease) in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  , due primarily to the following: 

Decrease in distillate margins   - We experienced a decrease in distillate margins throughout all of our regions in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . For example, the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast ultra-low-sulfur diesel was   $9.34   per barrel in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $13.76   per barrel in the first   nine   months of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of $  4.42   per barrel. Another example is the WTI-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Mid-Continent ultra-low-sulfur diesel that was   $12.70   per barrel in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $20.36   per barrel in the first   nine   months of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $7.66   per barrel. We estimate that the decrease in distillate margins per barrel in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.6 billion. 

Decrease in gasoline margins   - We experienced a decrease in gasoline margins throughout all of our regions during the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . For example, the ANS-based reference margin for U.S. West Coast CARBOB 87 gasoline was   $18.86   per barrel in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $27.21   per barrel during the first   nine   months of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $8.35   per barrel. Another example is the Brent-based benchmark reference margin for U.S. Gulf Coast CBOB gasoline that was   $9.54   per barrel in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $10.95   per barrel during the first   nine   months of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $1.41   per barrel.We estimate that the decrease in gasoline margins per barrel during the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $1.2 billion. 

Lower discounts on light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils   - The market prices for refined products generally track the price of Brent crude oil, which is a benchmark sweet crude oil, and we benefit when we process crude oils that are priced at a discount to Brent crude oil, such as WTI crude oil, in periods when pricing terms are favorable. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we benefited from processing WTI crude oil; however, that benefit declined compared to the benefit from processing WTI crude oil during the first   nine   months of   2015  . For example, WTI crude oil processed in our U.S. Mid-Continent region sold at a discount of   $1.80   per barrel to Brent crude oil in the first   nine   months of of   2016   compared to a discount of   $5.66   per barrel in the first   nine   months of of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $3.86   per barrel. Another example is Maya crude oil (a type of sour crude oil) that sold at a discount of   $8.73   per barrel to Brent crude oil during the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to a discount of   $9.24   per barrel during the first   nine   months of   2015  , representing an unfavorable decrease of   $0.51   per barrel. We estimate that the cost of light sweet crude oils and sour crude oils during the first   nine   months of   2016   had an unfavorable impact to our refining margin of approximately $720 million.

Higher costs of biofuel credits   - As more fully described in   Note 13   of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we must purchase biofuel credits in order to meet our biofuel blending obligation under various government and regulatory compliance programs, and the cost of these credits (primarily RINs in the U.S.) increased by   $249 million   from   $283 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015   to   $532 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  . This increase was due to an increase in the market price of RINs caused by an expected shortage in the market of available RINs. 

Higher throughput volumes   - Refining throughput volumes increased by   74,000   barrels per day in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . We estimate that the increase in refining throughput volumes had a positive impact on our refining margin of approximately $175 million. 
       
  The decrease of   $97 million   in operating expenses was primarily due to a $58 million decrease in energy costs driven by lower natural gas prices (  $2.27   per MMBtu in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $2.73   per MMBtu in the first   nine   months of   2015  ) and a $26 million decrease in employee-related expenses primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense. 
    
  The increase of   $63 million   in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to an increase of $41 million in depreciation expense associated with new capital projects and $30 million in refinery turnaround and catalyst amortization expense resulting from the completion of turnaround projects at several of our refineries. 
    
  Ethanol 
  Ethanol segment adjusted operating income increased   $9 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   primarily due to a   $39 million   decrease in operating expenses, partially offset by a $16 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense and a   $14 million   (or   $0.01   per gallon) decrease in gross margin. 
    
  The decrease in ethanol segment gross margin of   $14 million   was due primarily to the following: 

Lower ethanol prices   - Ethanol prices were lower in the first   nine   months of   2016   primarily due to the decrease in crude oil and gasoline prices in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  . For example, the New York Harbor ethanol price was   $1.55   per gallon in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $1.59   per gallon in the first   nine   months of   2015  . We estimate that the decrease in the price of ethanol per gallon during the first   nine   months of   2016   had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $30 million. 
                
    Lower co-product prices -   A decrease in export demand had an unfavorable effect on the prices we received for corn-related co-products, primarily distillers grains. We estimate that the decrease in distillers grain prices had an unfavorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $60 million. 

Lower corn prices   - Corn prices were lower in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to the first   nine   months of   2015   primarily due to higher forecasted yields from the current corn crop in the corn-producing regions of the U.S. Mid-Continent. For example, the CBOT corn price was   $3.62   per bushel in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $3.78   per bushel in the first   nine   months of   2015  . We estimate that the decrease in the price of corn that we processed during the first   nine   months of   2016   had a favorable impact to our ethanol margin of approximately $65 million.

The   $39 million   decrease in operating expenses was primarily due to a $22 million decrease in energy costs related to lower natural gas prices (  $2.27   per MMBtu in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared to   $2.73   per MMBtu in the first   nine   months of   2015  ) and a $13 million decrease in chemical costs. 
    
  The increase of   $16 million   in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to a $10 million gain on the sale of certain plant assets in the first   nine   months of 2015 that was reflected in depreciation and amortization expense thereby reducing depreciation and amortization expense in that period. 
    
  Other 
  In June 2016, we evaluated the Aruba Terminal for potential impairment and concluded that it was impaired, resulting in an asset impairment loss of   $56 million   related to our refining segment. This matter is more fully described in   Note 2   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Income tax expense decreased   $1.1 billion   from the first   nine   months of   2015   to the first   nine   months of   2016   primarily as a result of lower income before income tax expense. The effective tax rates of   25   percent in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   32   percent in the first   nine   months of   2015   are lower than the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent because income from our international operations is taxed at statutory rates that are lower than in the U.S. The effective tax rate in the first   nine   months of   2016   was also lower than the rate in the first   nine   months of   2015   due to (i) the reversal of the lower of cost or market inventory valuation reserve of   $747 million  , the majority of which impacted our international operations that are taxed at lower statutory tax rates, (ii) a benefit of   $42 million   associated with the transfer of ownership of the Aruba Refinery and Aruba Terminal to the GOA, and (iii) a benefit of $35 million resulting from the settlement of an income tax audit. The transfer of ownership of the Aruba Refinery and the Aruba Terminal to the GOA is more fully described in   Note 2   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Cash Flows for the   Nine Months Ended September 30,     2016 
  Our operations generated   $3.8 billion   of cash in the first   nine   months of   2016  , driven primarily by net income of   $2.0 billion   and excluding   $928 million   of noncash charges to income, along with a positive change in working capital of   $953 million  . Noncash charges include   $1.4 billion   of depreciation and amortization expense,   $56 million   for the asset impairment loss associated with our Aruba Terminal, and   $193 million   of deferred income tax expense, partially offset by a benefit of   $747 million   from a lower of cost or market inventory valuation adjustment. See  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital is further detailed in   Note 11   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This source of cash mainly resulted from: 
             
    an increase in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in receivables, primarily as a result of increasing commodity prices; and  
                
    the temporary reduction of our inventories. 
       
  The   $3.8 billion   of cash generated by our operations, along with   $1.65 billion   in proceeds from the issuance of debt (primarily   $1.25 billion   of   3.4   percent senior notes due   September 15, 2026   and borrowings under the VLP Revolver of   $349 million   as discussed in   Note 4   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), were used mainly to: 
             
    fund   $1.4 billion   in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture investments; 
                
    pay off a long-term liability of   $137 million   owed to a joint venture partner for an owner-method joint venture investment; 
                
    purchase common stock for treasury of   $1.2 billion  ; 
                
    pay common stock dividends of   $840 million  ; 
                
    pay distributions of   $54 million   to noncontrolling interests; and  
                
    increase available cash on hand by   $1.8 billion  . 
       
  Cash Flows for the   Nine Months Ended September 30,     2015 
  Our operations generated   $5.1 billion   of cash in the first   nine   months of   2015  , driven primarily by net income of   $3.7 billion   and excluding   $1.4 billion   of noncash charges to income. Noncash charges include   $1.3 billion   of depreciation and amortization expense and   $77 million   of deferred income tax expense. See  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  for further discussion of our operations. The change in our working capital in the first   nine   months of   2015   had little impact to cash generated by our operations, contributing only $46 million. The change in our working capital is further detailed in   Note 11   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This source of cash mainly resulted from a decrease in receivables, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable, primarily as a result of decreasing commodity prices. 
    
  The   $5.1 billion   of cash generated by our operations in the first   nine   months of   2015  , along with   $1.45 billion   in proceeds from the issuance of debt (  $600 million   of   3.65   percent senior notes due   March 15, 2025  ,   $650 million   of   4.9   percent senior notes due   March 15, 2045  , and borrowings under the VLP Revolver of   $200 million   as discussed in   Note 4   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), were used mainly to: 
             
    fund   $1.7 billion   in capital investments, which include capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture investments; 
                
    make debt repayments of   $509 million  , of which   $400 million   related to our   4.5   percent senior notes,   $75 million   related to our   8.75   percent debentures,   $25 million   related to the VLP Revolver, and $9 million related to other non-bank debt and capital lease obligations; 
                
    purchase common stock for treasury of   $2.1 billion  ;

     Table of Contents  

pay common stock dividends of   $608 million  ; 
                
    pay distributions of   $39 million   to noncontrolling interests; and  
                
    increase available cash on hand by   $1.6 billion  . 
     Capital Investments 
  For 2016, we expect to incur approximately $2.4 billion for capital investments, including capital expenditures, deferred turnaround and catalyst costs, and equity-method joint venture investments. This consists of approximately $1.5 billion for stay-in-business capital and $900 million for growth strategies, including our continued investment in Diamond Pipeline LLC (Diamond Pipeline) described below. This capital investment estimate excludes potential strategic acquisitions. We continuously evaluate our capital budget and make changes as conditions warrant. 
    
  We hold equity-method investments in joint ventures and we invest in these joint ventures or enter into new joint venture arrangements to enhance our operations. In December 2015, we exercised our option to purchase a 50 percent interest in Diamond Pipeline, which was formed by Plains Pipeline, L.P. (Plains) to construct and operate a 440-mile, 20-inch crude oil pipeline expected to provide capacity of up to 200,000 barrels per day of domestic sweet crude oil from the Plains Cushing, Oklahoma terminal to our Memphis Refinery, with the ability to connect into the Capline Pipeline. The pipeline is expected to be completed in 2017 for an estimated $925 million.  We have contributed $136 million in Diamond Pipeline and expect to continue making contributions as the construction progresses. 
    
  Contractual Obligations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our contractual obligations included debt, capital lease obligations, operating leases, purchase obligations, and other long-term liabilities. There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business with respect to these contractual obligations during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . In October 2016, we entered into agreements under which we expect to lease storage tanks located at three of our refineries. The leases will not commence until certain required regulatory permitting occurs. The lease agreements will be accounted for as capital leases and we expect to recognize capital lease assets and related obligations of approximately   $490 million  . These capital lease agreements have initial terms of   10   years each and each agreement has successive   10  -year automatic renewal terms. 
    
  Currently, we have an accounts receivable sales facility with a group of third-party entities and financial institutions to sell eligible trade receivables on a revolving basis up to   $1.3 billion  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the actual availability under the facility fell below the facility borrowing capacity to   $1.2 billion   primarily due to a decrease in eligible trade receivables as a result of the current market price environment for the finished products that we produce. 
    
  Our debt and financing agreements do not have rating agency triggers that would automatically require us to post additional collateral. However, in the event of certain downgrades of our senior unsecured debt by the ratings agencies, the cost of borrowings under some of our bank credit facilities and other arrangements would increase. All of the ratings on our senior unsecured debt are at or above investment grade level as follows: 
                   Rating Agency 
      
    Rating 
      Moody s Investors Service 
      
    Baa2 (stable outlook) 
      Standard   Poor s Ratings Services 
      
    BBB (stable outlook) 
      Fitch Ratings 
      
    BBB (stable outlook) 

68 

     Table of Contents  

We cannot provide assurance that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. We note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell, or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Any future reduction below investment grade or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short- and long-term financing and the cost of such financings. 
    
  Summary of Credit Facilities 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings and letters of credit issued under our credit facilities as follows (in millions): 

Letters of credit issued as of   September 30, 2016   expire in 2016 through 2018. 
    
  Other Matters Impacting Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Stock Purchase Program 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $190 million   of our common stock remaining to be purchased under our previously authorized $2.5 billion common stock purchase program. On   September 21, 2016  , our board of directors authorized our purchase of up to an additional   $2.5 billion   of our outstanding common stock with no expiration date. We have no obligation to make purchases under the program. 
    
  Pension Plan Funding 
  We contributed   $132 million   to our pension plans and   $12 million   to our other postretirement benefit plans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . During the fourth quarter of 2016, we plan to contribute approximately   $4 million   to our pension plans and   $8 million   to our other postretirement benefit plans. 
    
  Environmental Matters 
  Our operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations by governmental authorities relating to the discharge of materials into the environment, waste management, pollution prevention measures, GHG emissions, and characteristics and composition of gasolines and distillates. Because environmental laws and regulations are becoming more complex and stringent and new environmental laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed, the level of future expenditures required for environmental matters could increase in the future as previously discussed above in  OUTLOOK.  In addition, any major upgrades in any of our operating facilities could require material additional expenditures to comply with environmental  

69 

     Table of Contents  

laws and regulations. See   Note 5   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our environmental matters. 
    
  Tax Matters 
  During the third quarter of 2016, we settled the audit related to our U.S. federal income tax returns for 2008 and 2009. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has ongoing tax audits related to our U.S. federal income tax returns from 2010 through 2014, and we have received Revenue Agent Reports (RARs) in connection with the 2010 and 2011 audit. We are contesting certain tax positions and assertions included in the RARs and continue to make progress in resolving certain of these matters with the IRS. We believe that the ultimate settlement of these audits will not be material to our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. 
    
  Cash Held by Our International Subsidiaries 
  We operate in countries outside the U.S. through subsidiaries incorporated in these countries, and the earnings of these subsidiaries are taxed by the countries in which they are incorporated. We intend to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in our international operations even though we are not restricted from repatriating such earnings to the U.S. in the form of cash dividends. Should we decide to repatriate such earnings, we would incur and pay taxes on the amounts repatriated. In addition, such repatriation could cause us to record deferred tax expense that could significantly impact our results of operations. We believe, however, that a substantial portion of our international cash can be returned to the U.S. without significant tax consequences through means other than a repatriation of earnings. As of   September 30, 2016  , $2.2 billion of our cash and temporary cash investments was held by our international subsidiaries. 
    
  Concentration of Customers 
  Our operations have a concentration of customers in the refining industry and customers who are refined product wholesalers and retailers. These concentrations of customers may impact our overall exposure to credit risk, either positively or negatively, in that these customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. However, we believe that our portfolio of accounts receivable is sufficiently diversified to the extent necessary to minimize potential credit risk. Historically, we have not had any significant problems collecting our accounts receivable. 
    
  Sources of Liquidity 
  We believe that we have sufficient funds from operations and, to the extent necessary, from borrowings under our credit facilities, to fund our ongoing operating requirements. We expect that, to the extent necessary, we can raise additional funds from time to time through equity or debt financings in the public and private capital markets or the arrangement of additional credit facilities. However, there can be no assurances regarding the availability of any future financings or additional credit facilities or whether such financings or additional credit facilities can be made available on terms that are acceptable to us. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies since the date our annual report on Form 10 K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   was filed.

    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
       
  COMMODITY PRICE RISK 
    
  We are exposed to market risks related to the volatility in the price of crude oil, refined products (primarily gasoline and distillate), grain (primarily corn), soybean oil, and natural gas used in our operations. To reduce the impact of price volatility on our results of operations and cash flows, we use commodity derivative instruments, including swaps, futures, and options to manage the volatility of: 
             
    inventories and firm commitments to purchase inventories generally for amounts by which our current year inventory levels (determined on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) basis) differ from our previous year-end LIFO inventory levels, and 
                
    forecasted feedstock and refined product purchases, refined product sales, natural gas purchases, and corn purchases to lock in the price of those forecasted transactions at existing market prices that we deem favorable. 
       
  We use the futures markets for the available liquidity, which provides greater flexibility in transacting our price risk activities. We use swaps primarily to manage our price exposure. We also enter into certain commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes to take advantage of existing market conditions related to future results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  Our positions in commodity derivative instruments are monitored and managed on a daily basis by our risk control group to ensure compliance with our stated risk management policy that has been approved by our board of directors. 
    
  The following sensitivity analysis includes all positions at the end of the reporting period with which we have market risk (in millions):

COMPLIANCE PROGRAM PRICE RISK  
    
  We are exposed to market risk related to the volatility in the price of biofuel credits and GHG emission credits needed to comply with various governmental and regulatory programs. To manage these risks, we enter into contracts to purchase these credits when prices are deemed favorable. Some of these contracts are derivative instruments; however, we elect the normal purchase exception and do not record these contracts at their fair values. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was an immaterial amount of gain or loss in the fair value of derivative instruments that would result from a 10 percent increase or decrease in the underlying price of the contracts. See   Note 13   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion about these compliance programs. 
    
  INTEREST RATE RISK 
    
  The following table provides information about our debt instruments, the fair values of which are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates are presented. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had commitments to purchase   $328 million   of U.S. dollars. Our market risk was minimal on these contracts, as all of them matured on or before   October 31, 2016  .

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. 
    Legal Proceedings 
       
  The information below describes new proceedings or material developments in proceedings that we previously reported in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Litigation 
  We hereby incorporate by reference into this Item our disclosures made in Part I, Item 1 of this report included in   Note 5   of Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under the caption    Litigation Matters.  
    
  Environmental Enforcement Matters 
  While it is not possible to predict the outcome of the following environmental proceedings, if any one or more of them were decided against us, we believe that there would be no material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. We are reporting these proceedings to comply with SEC regulations, which require us to disclose certain information about proceedings arising under federal, state, or local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or protecting the environment if we reasonably believe that such proceedings will result in monetary sanctions of $100,000 or more. 
    
  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)   (Benicia Refinery)  .   In our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we reported that we had received settlement communications from the EPA regarding various alleged reporting and storage violations at our Benicia Refinery, which we reasonably believe will result in penalties in excess of $100,000. We recently resolved this matter with the EPA. 
    
  Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD)   (Benicia Refinery). We currently have multiple outstanding Violation Notices (VNs) issued by the BAAQMD from 2013 to the present. These VNs are for alleged reporting violations and excess emissions at our Benicia Refinery and asphalt plant. In the third quarter of 2016, we entered into an Agreement with the BAAQMD to resolve various outstanding VNs and continue to work with the BAAQMD to resolve the remaining VNs. 
    
  San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)   (Benicia Refinery). The RWQCB issued a Notice of Administrative Civil Liability to our Benicia Refinery in October 2016 for alleged violations of the Refinery s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit with a proposed penalty of $197,500. We are working with the RWQCB to resolve this matter. 
    
  Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)   (Port Arthur Refinery). In our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, we reported that we had received two proposed Agreed Orders from the TCEQ resolving multiple violations that occurred between May 2007 and April 2013 at our Port Arthur Refinery. In the third quarter of 2016, we finalized both Agreed Orders resolving these matters with the TCEQ. 
    
  Environment Canada (EC)   (Quebec Refinery). We are involved in a legal proceeding initiated by the EC alleging breaches of certain conditions at our Quebec Refinery of a directive issued under the Canadian Fisheries Act. We are working with the EC to resolve the matter, which we reasonably believe will result in penalties in excess of $100,000.

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  We disclose the following risk factor in addition to the risk factors we have disclosed in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Renewable Fuel Standard could adversely affect our performance. 
    
  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented a Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. The RFS program sets annual quotas for the quantity of renewable fuels (such as ethanol) that must be blended into transportation fuels consumed in the United States. A Renewable Identification Number (RIN) is assigned to each gallon of renewable fuel produced in or imported into the United States. As a producer of petroleum-based transportation fuels, we are obligated to blend renewable fuels into the products we produce at a rate that is at least commensurate to the EPA s quota and, to the extent we do not, we must purchase RINs in the open market to satisfy our obligation under the RFS program.  
    
  We are exposed to the volatility in the market price of RINs. We cannot predict the future prices of RINs. RINs prices are dependent upon a variety of factors, including EPA regulations, the availability of RINs for purchase, the price at which RINs can be purchased, and levels of transportation fuels produced, all of which can vary significantly from quarter to quarter. If sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase or if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs, or if we are otherwise unable to meet the EPA s RFS mandates, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.
