  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
  NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  General 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all information and notes to the consolidated financial statements necessary for a complete presentation of financial position, results of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for FCB Financial Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) previously filed with the SEC in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year or any other interim period. 
  Nature of Operations 
  The Company is a national bank holding company with   one   wholly-owned national bank subsidiary, Florida Community Bank, N.A. ( Florida Community Bank  or the  Bank ), headquartered in Weston, Florida, offering a comprehensive range of traditional banking products and services to individual and corporate customers through   48   banking centers located in Florida at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank, and the Bank s subsidiaries, which consist of a group of real estate holding companies. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Use of Estimates 
  The Company s financial reporting and accounting policies conform to U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Material estimates subject to significant change include the allowance for loan losses, valuation of and accounting for loans covered by loss sharing arrangements with the FDIC and the related loss share receivable, valuation of and accounting for acquired loans, the carrying value of OREO, the fair value of financial instruments, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets, contingent consideration liabilities, acquisition-related fair value computations, stock-based compensation and deferred taxes. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
  In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12,  Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period . This ASU provides specific guidance on whether to treat a performance target that could be achieved after the requisite service period as a performance condition that affects vesting or as a non-vesting condition that affects the grant-date fair value of an award. The amendments in this ASU became effective for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-16,  Determining Whether the Host Contract in a Hybrid Financial Instrument Issued in the Form of a Share is More Akin to Debt or Equity   a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging) . This ASU requires an entity to determine the nature of an instrument by evaluating all economic characteristics and risks of the entire hybrid instrument when determining whether the host is more akin to debit or equity. The amendments in this ASU became effective for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01,  Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items (ASC 225-20, Extraordinary and Unusual Items)  which eliminates the concept of extraordinary items. Under the ASU, extraordinary items will no longer be segregated from the results of ordinary operations and presented separately on the consolidated financial statements. The amendments in this ASU became effective for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,  Amendments to the Consolidated Analysis (ASC 810, Consolidation)  which amends the consolidation requirements of ASC 810 by reducing the number of consolidation models. The guidance places more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest; reduces the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial interest and changes the consolidation requirements of limited partnerships. The amendments in this ASU became effective for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments  which requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments in this ASU require that the acquirer record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments in this ASU became effective for the first quarter ended March 31, 2016. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments-Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  which: 

Requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  
                
    Simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. 
                
    Eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. 
                
    Requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. 
                
    Requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. 
                
    Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. 
                
    Clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. 
     For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application by public business entities to financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued or, by all other entities, that have not yet been made available for issuance of the following amendments in this ASU are permitted as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption: 
           1. 
    An entity should present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk if the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. 
              2. 
    Entities that are not public business entities are not required to apply the fair value of financial instruments disclosure guidance in the General Subsection of Section 825-10-50. 
     Except for the early application guidance discussed above, early adoption of the amendments in this ASU is not permitted.

     Table of Contents  

An entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values (including disclosure requirements) should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the ASU. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  which created Topic 842, Leases, and supersedes the leases requirements in Topic 840, Leases. Topic 842 specifies the accounting for leases. The core principal of Topic 842 is that a lessee should recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and liabilities. For public entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application of the amendments in this ASU is permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06,  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments  which clarifies the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments in this ASU is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-stop decision sequence. The amendments are an improvement to GAAP because they eliminate diversity in practice in assessing embedded contingent call (put) options in debt instruments. For public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the amendments in this ASU on a modified retrospective basis to existing debt instruments as of the beginning of the fiscal year for which the amendments are effective. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,  Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting  which eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments in this ASU require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. The Company does not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This ASU eliminates equity treatment for tax benefits or deficiencies that result from differences between the compensation cost recognized for GAAP purposes and the related tax deduction at settlement or expiration with such changes recognized in income tax expense and excludes excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies from the calculation of assumed proceeds for earnings per share purposes since such amounts are recognized in the income statement, which will result in greater volatility in earnings per share. In addition, this ASU simplifies the statements of cash flows by eliminating the bifurcation of excess tax benefits from operating activities to financing activities. Upon adoption, the amendments in this ASU provide for a tiered transition approach whereby amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements and forfeitures should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement should be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this ASU clarify the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance, while retaining the related principles for those areas. The amendments in this ASU affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this ASU are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by ASU 2014-09). ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  The amendments in this ASU do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. Rather, the amendments in this ASU clarify the guidance on assessing collectability, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. The amendments in this ASU affect the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this ASU are the same as the effective date and transition requirements in Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by ASU 2014-09). ASU 2015-14,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date , deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit losses (Topic 326): Measurement of credit losses on financial instruments.  Topic 326 amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, Topic 326 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available for sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current GAAP, however Topic 326 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. This ASU affects entities holding financial assets and net investment in leases that are not accounted for at fair value through net income. The amendments affect loans, debt securities, trade receivables, net investments in leases, off balance sheet credit exposures, reinsurance receivables, and any other financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to receive cash. For public business entities that are SEC filers, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other public business entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. All entities may adopt the amendments in this ASU earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity will apply the amendments in this ASU through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (that is, a modified-retrospective approach). A prospective transition approach is required for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the effective date. The effect of a prospective transition approach is to maintain the same amortized cost basis before and after the effective date of this ASU. Amounts previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income as of the date of adoption that relate to improvements in cash flows expected to be collected should continue to be accreted into income over the remaining life of the asset. Recoveries of amounts previously written off relating to improvements in cash flows after the date of adoption should be recorded in earnings when received. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Statement of cash flows (Topic 230): Classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments." The objective of this guidance is to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows under Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, and other Topics. This ASU addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: Debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies (COLIs) (including bank-owned life insurance policies (BOLIs)); distributions received from equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments in this ASU should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The Company is currently evaluating this guidance to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  NOTE 2. INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses and approximate fair values of securities available for sale are as follows:  

As part of the Company s liquidity management strategy, the Company pledges loans and securities to secure borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta ("FHLB'). The Company also pledges securities to collateralize public deposits, repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps. The carrying value of all pledged securities totaled   $538.0 million   and   $939.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of securities available for sale, by contractual maturity, are as follows: 

For purposes of the maturity table, U.S Government agencies and sponsored enterprises obligations, agency mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities, the principal of which are repaid periodically, are presented as a single amount. The expected lives of these securities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay the underlying loans with or without prepayment penalties. 
    
  The following tables present the estimated fair values and gross unrealized losses on investment securities available for sale, aggregated by investment category and length of time individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position as of the periods presented:

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s security portfolio consisted of   346   securities, of which   79   securities were in an unrealized loss position. A total of   34   were in an unrealized loss position for less than   12 months  . The unrealized losses for these securities resulted primarily from changes in interest rates and spreads. 
  The Company monitors its investment securities for other-than-temporary-impairment ("OTTI"). Impairment is evaluated on an individual security basis considering numerous factors, and its relative significance varying by situation. The Company has evaluated the nature of unrealized losses in the investment securities portfolio to determine if OTTI exists. The unrealized losses relate to changes in market interest rates and market conditions that do not represent credit-related impairments. Furthermore, the Company does not intend to sell nor is it more likely than not that it will be required to sell these investments before the recovery of their amortized cost basis. Management has completed an assessment of each security in an unrealized loss position for credit impairment, including securities with existing characteristics that are covered under the Volcker Rule, and has determined that no individual security was other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . The following describes the basis under which the Company has evaluated OTTI: 
  U.S. Government Agencies and Sponsored Enterprises Obligations and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities ( MBS ): 
  The unrealized losses associated with U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises obligations and agency MBS are primarily driven by changes in interest rates. These securities have either an explicit or implicit U.S. government guarantee. 
  Asset-Backed Securities and Corporate Bonds   Other Debt Securities: 
  Securities were underwritten in accordance with the Company s investment standards prior to the decision to purchase, without relying on a bond issuer s guarantee in making the investment decision. These investments are investment grade and will continue to be monitored as part of the Company s ongoing impairment analysis, but are expected to perform in accordance with their terms. 
  Preferred Stock and Other Equity Securities: 
  The unrealized losses associated with preferred stock and other equity securities in large U.S. financial institutions are primarily driven by changes in interest rates and spreads. These securities were generally underwritten in accordance with the Company s investment standards prior to the decision to purchase.

NOTE 3. LOANS, NET 
  The Company s loan portfolio consists of New and Acquired loans. The Company classifies originated loans and purchased loans not acquired through business combinations as New loans. The Company classifies loans acquired through business combinations as Acquired loans. All acquired loans not specifically excluded under ASC 310-30 are accounted for under ASC 310-30. The remaining portfolio of acquired loans excluded under ASC 310-30 are accounted for under ASC 310-20 and are classified as Non-ASC 310-30 loans. 
  The following tables summarize the Company s loans by portfolio and segment as of the periods presented, net of deferred fees, costs, premiums and discounts:

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the unpaid principal balance of ASC 310-30 loans were   $280.4 million   and   $457.9 million  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had pledged loans as collateral for FHLB advances of   $3.11 billion   and   $2.13 billion  , respectively. The recorded investments of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $3.1 million  . The Company held   $466.9 million   and   $464.2 million   of syndicated national loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company purchased approximately   $9.7   and   $198.9 million   in loans from third parties. During the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2015, the Company purchased approximately   $0.0 million   and   $233.6 million  , respectively, in loans from third parties. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold approximately   $23.3 million   and   $85.0 million  , respectively, loans to third parties.  During the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2015, the Company sold approximately   $26.4 million   and   $45.9 million  , respectively, in loans to third parties. 
  The accretable discount on ASC 310-30 loans represents the amount by which the undiscounted expected cash flows on such loans exceed their carrying value. The change in expected cash flows for certain ASC 310-30 loan pools resulted in the reclassification of   $23.2 million   and   $28.6 million   between non-accretable and accretable discount during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Changes in accretable discount for ASC 310-30 loans for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were as follows:

NOTE 4. ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES 
  The Company s accounting method for loans and the corresponding allowance for loan losses ( ALL ) differs depending on whether the loans are New or Acquired. The Company assesses and monitors credit risk and portfolio performance using distinct methodologies for Acquired loans, both ASC 310-30 Loans and Non-ASC 310-30 Loans, and New loans. Within each of these portfolios, the Company further disaggregates the portfolios into the following segments: Commercial real estate, Owner-occupied commercial real estate, 1-4 single family residential, Construction, land and development, Home equity loans and lines of credit, Commercial and industrial and Consumer. The ALL reflects management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in each of the segments. 
  Changes in the ALL by loan portfolio and segment for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows:

Credit Quality Indicators 
  In evaluating credit risk, the Company looks at multiple factors; however, management considers delinquency status to be the most meaningful indicator of the credit quality of 1-4 single family residential, home equity loans and lines of credit and consumer loans. Delinquency statistics are updated at least monthly. Internal risk ratings are considered the most meaningful indicator of credit quality for Non-ASC 310-30 and New commercial, construction, land and development and commercial real estate loans. Internal risk ratings are updated on a continuous basis.

The following tables present an aging analysis of the recorded investment for delinquent loans by portfolio and segment (excluding loans accounted for under ASC 310-30): 

19 

     Table of Contents  

Loans exhibiting potential credit weaknesses that deserve management s close attention and that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment capacity of the borrower are categorized as special mention. Loans with well-defined credit weaknesses including payment defaults, declining collateral values, frequent overdrafts, operating losses, increasing balance sheet leverage, inadequate cash flow, project cost overruns, unreasonable construction delays, past due real estate taxes or exhausted interest reserves are assigned an internal risk rating of substandard. A loan with a weakness so severe that collection in full is highly questionable or improbable will be assigned an internal risk rating of doubtful.

  Amortization expense for core deposit intangibles for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled   $933 thousand   and   $1.2 million  , respectively. 
  The estimated amount of amortization expense for core deposit intangible assets to be recognized during the next five fiscal years is as follows:   

NOTE 6. DERIVATIVES 
  The Company is a party to interest rate derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments. These derivatives are interest rate swaps that the Company enters into with customers to allow customers to convert variable rate loans to fixed rates. At the same time the interest rate swap is entered into with the customer, an offsetting interest rate swap is entered into with another financial institution. The changes in the fair value of the swaps offset each other, except for any differences in the credit risk of the counterparties, which is determined by considering the risk rating, probability of default and loss of given default of each counterparty. The Company recorded   $993 thousand   and   $892 thousand   of customer swap fees in noninterest income in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $3.5 million   and   $3.7 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has not recorded any credit adjustments related to the credit risk of the counterparties. There was no change in the fair value of derivative assets and derivative liabilities attributable to credit risk included in noninterest expense on the statements of income for the three or nine months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
    
  The following tables summarize the Company s derivatives outstanding included in other assets and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets:

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company has pledged investment securities available for sale with a carrying amount of   $50.8 million   as collateral for the interest rate swaps in a liability position. The amount of collateral required to be posted by the Company varies based on the settlement value of outstanding swaps. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , substantially all of the floating rate terms within the interest rate contracts held by the Company were indexed to 1-month LIBOR. 
  The fair value of the derivative assets and liabilities are included in a table in Note 13  Fair Value Measurements,  in the line items  Derivative assets  and  Derivative liabilities.

NOTE 7. DEPOSITS 
  The following table sets forth the Company s deposits by category: 

The aggregate amount of overdraft demand deposits reclassified to loans was   $391 thousand   at   September 30, 2016  . The aggregate amount of maturities for time deposits for each of the five years as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $1.56 billion  ,   $541.2 million  ,   $178.1 million  ,   $6.1 million   and   $9.0 million  , respectively. The Company holds brokered deposits through an insured deposit sweep program of   $601.4 million   and   $425.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company holds brokered certificates of deposit of   $3.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

NOTE 9. BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE 
  Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is calculated by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflect the effect of common stock equivalents, including stock options and unvested shares, calculated using the treasury stock method. Common stock equivalents are excluded from the computation of diluted EPS in periods in which the effect is anti-dilutive. 
    
  The following table presents the computation of basic and diluted EPS: 

NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES 
  The Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate method in computing its interim tax provision. This effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual pre-tax income, permanent tax differences and statutory tax rates. 
  The effective tax rates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 were   35.5%   and   34.9%  , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the   third   quarter of   2016   was primarily due to higher levels of pre-tax income, which is subject to the marginal tax rate and changes in permanent tax differences. The tax rate differs from the statutory rate due to the impact of tax benefits related to bank-owned life insurance, dividends received deductions and certain stock-based compensation awards. 
  The effective tax rates for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   36.1%   and   5.7%  , respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016  was primarily due to the prior year loss associated with the early termination of the FDIC loss share agreements and a deferred tax asset benefit associated with the revaluation of net unrealized built-in losses related to the Company s acquisition of Great Florida Bank on January 31, 2014.

  On March 29, 2016, the Compensation Committee granted   121,212   restricted shares (the "Award") of Class A Common Stock to certain Executives. Shareholder's approved the Plan at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders on May 16, 2016 which was determined to be the grant date of the Award. The fair value of the Awards on the grant date was   $4.2 million    and will be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite vesting period ending December 31, 2018. The Company recognized   $836 thousand   of compensation expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
   
  NOTE 12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  The Company issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with its lending activities and to meet the financing needs of its customers. These financial instruments include commitments to fund loans and lines of credit as well as commercial and standby letters of credit. These commitments expose the Company to varying degrees of credit and market risk which are essentially the same as those involved in extending loans to customers. The Company follows the same credit policies in making commitments as it does for instruments recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. Collateral is obtained based on management s assessment of the customer s credit risk. 
  The Company s exposure to credit loss is represented by the contractual amount of these commitments. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company s reserve for unfunded commitments totaled   $1.6 million   and   $1.5 million  , respectively. 
  Fees collected on off-balance sheet financial instruments represent the fair value of those commitments and are deferred and amortized over their term. 
  Financial Instruments Commitments 
  Unfunded commitments are as follows: 

33 

     Table of Contents  

Commitments to fund loans: 
  Commitments to fund loans are agreements to lend funds to customers as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. To accommodate the financial needs of customers, the Company makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to consumers and businesses. Commitments to fund loans generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Many of these commitments are expected to expire without being funded and, therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. 
  The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral required in connection with a commitment to fund is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. 
  Unused lines of credit: 
  Unfunded commitments under lines of credit include commercial, commercial real estate, home equity and consumer lines of credit to existing customers. Some of these commitments may mature without being fully funded. 
  Commercial and standby letters of credit: 
  Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Letters of credit are primarily issued to support trade transactions or guarantee arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. The Company generally holds collateral supporting those commitments if deemed necessary. 
  Other Commitments and Contingencies 
  Legal Proceedings 
  The Company, from time to time, is involved as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. While the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management, based upon advice of legal counsel, that no proceedings exist, either individually or in the aggregate, which, if determined adversely to the Company, would have a material effect on the Company s consolidated balance sheet, results of operations or cash flows. 
   
  NOTE 13. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities and the related fair value hierarchy, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. When possible, the Company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities. When identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities. It is the Company s policy to maximize the use of observable inputs, minimize the use of unobservable inputs and use unobservable inputs to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available. The need to use unobservable inputs generally results from the lack of market liquidity, resulting in diminished observability of both actual trades and assumptions that would otherwise be available to value instruments, or the value of underlying collateral is not market observable. Although third party price indications may be available for an asset or liability, limited trading activity would make it difficult to support the observability of these quotations. 
  Financial Instruments Carried at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of each instrument under the valuation hierarchy. 
  Investment Securities Investment securities available for sale are carried at fair value on a recurring basis. When available, fair value is based on quoted prices for the identical security in an active market and as such, would be classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, discounted cash flows or matrix pricing models. Investment securities available for sale for which Level 1 valuations are not available are classified as Level 2 if the valuation incorporates primarily observable inputs. Level 2 securities include U.S. Government agencies and sponsored enterprises obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities; state and municipal obligations; asset-backed securities; and corporate debt and other securities. Pricing of these securities is generally spread driven. 
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

Observable inputs that may impact the valuation of these securities include benchmark yield curves, credit spreads, reported trades, dealer quotes, bids, issuer spreads, current rating, historical constant prepayment rates, historical voluntary prepayment rates, structural and waterfall features of individual securities, published collateral data, and for certain securities, historical constant default rates and default severities. 
  Interest Rate Derivatives Interest rate derivatives are reported at estimated fair value utilizing Level 2 inputs and are included in other assets and other liabilities and consist of interest rate swaps where there is   no   significant deterioration in the counterparties (loan customers) credit risk since origination of the interest rate swap. The Company values its interest rate swap positions using market prices provided by a third party which uses primarily observable market inputs. Interest rate derivatives are further described in Note 6  Derivatives.  
  For purposes of potential valuation adjustments to our derivative positions, the Company evaluates the credit risk of its counterparties as well as its own credit risk. Accordingly, the Company has considered factors such as the likelihood of default, expected loss given default, net exposures and remaining contractual life, among other things, in determining if any estimated fair value adjustments related to credit risk are required. The Company reviews counterparty exposure quarterly, and when necessary, appropriate adjustments are made to reflect the exposure. 
    
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or 2015, the Company has not realized any losses due to a counterparty s inability to pay any net uncollateralized position. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no interest rate derivatives classified as Level 3. 
  The following table presents the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

35 

     Table of Contents  

There were   $58.2   million in transfers of financial assets from level 2 into level 1 of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . There were no transfers of financial assets between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  For the   three or nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, there was not a change in the methods or significant assumptions used to estimate fair value. 
  Financial Instruments Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis 
  The following is a description of the methodologies used to estimate the fair values of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, and the level within the fair value hierarchy in which those measurements are typically classified. 
  Impaired loans and OREO The carrying amount of collateral dependent impaired loans is typically based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, which may be real estate or other business assets, less estimated costs to sell. The carrying value of OREO is initially measured based on the fair value, less estimated cost to sell, of the real estate acquired in foreclosure and subsequently adjusted to the lower of cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell. Fair values of real estate collateral are typically based on real estate appraisals which utilize market and income valuation techniques incorporating both observable and unobservable inputs. When current appraisals are not available, the Company may use brokers  price opinions, home price indices, or other available information about changes in real estate market conditions to adjust the latest appraised value available. These adjustments to appraised values may be subjective and involve significant management judgment. The fair value of collateral consisting of other business assets is generally based on appraisals that use market approaches to valuation, incorporating primarily unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements related to collateral dependent impaired loans and OREO are classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  The following table shows significant unobservable inputs used in the non-recurring fair value measurement of level 3 assets and liabilities: 

36 

     Table of Contents  

The following tables provide information about certain assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis: 

Impairment charges resulting from the non-recurring changes in fair value of the underlying collateral of impaired loans are included in the provision for loan losses in the consolidated statement of income. Impairment charges resulting from the non-recurring changes in fair value of OREO are included in other real estate and acquired assets resolution expenses in the consolidated statement of income. 
    
  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values, as well as the level within the fair value hierarchy, of the Company s financial instruments are as follows: 

37 

     Table of Contents  

Certain financial instruments are carried at amounts that approximate fair value due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. Financial instruments for which fair value approximates the carrying amount at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , include cash and cash equivalents. 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments. Estimates may differ from actual exit value as defined by ASC 820.   
  FHLB and Other Bank Stock: 
  FHLB and other bank stock can be liquidated only by redemption by the issuer, as there is no market for these securities. These securities are carried at par, which has historically represented the redemption price and is therefore considered to approximate fair value. 
  Loans: 
  Fair values for loans are based on a discounted cash flow methodology that considers various factors, including the type of loan and related collateral, classification status, fixed or variable interest rate, term of loan, whether or not the loan was amortizing and current discount rates. Loans are grouped together according to similar characteristics and are treated in the aggregate when applying various valuation techniques. The discount rates used for loans are based on current market rates for new originations of comparable credit risk and include adjustments for liquidity concerns. The ALL is considered a reasonable estimate of the required adjustment to fair value to reflect the impact of credit risk.  
    
  Loans Held for Sale: 
  Fair values of mortgage loans held for sale are based on commitments on hand from investors or prevailing market prices. 
  Bank-owned Life Insurance: 
  The Company holds life insurance policies on certain officers. The carrying value of these policies approximates fair value as it is based on the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or amounts due that are probable at settlement. 
  Deposits: 
  The fair value of demand deposits, savings accounts and money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of fixed-maturity certificates of deposit is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
  Advances from the FHLB and Other Borrowings: 
  The fair value of advances from the FHLB and other borrowings are estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rate at which similar borrowings with similar remaining maturities could be obtained.

  Primary Factors Used to Evaluate Our Business 
  As a financial institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our financial condition. We evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our consolidated balance sheets and income statements, as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against our own historical performance, our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region and nationally. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of interest income on loans receivable, including accretion income on acquired loans, securities and other short-term investments, and interest expense on interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of deposits and borrowings. Our results of operations are also dependent upon our generation of noninterest income, consisting of income from banking service fees, interest rate swap services, BOLI and recoveries on acquired assets. Other factors contributing to our results of operations include our provisions for loan losses, gains or losses on securities and income taxes, as well as the level of our noninterest expenses, such as compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment and other miscellaneous operating expenses. 
  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income, a significant contributor to our revenues and net income, represents interest income less interest expense. We generate interest income from interest, dividends and fees received on interest-earning assets, including loans and investment securities. We incur interest expense from interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities, including interest-bearing deposits, and borrowings. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (1) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the costs of our deposits and other funding sources, (3) our net interest spread, (4) our net interest margin and (5) our provision for loan losses. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and stockholders  equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources. 
  We also recognize income from the accretable discounts associated with the purchase of interest-earning assets. Our acquisitions in 2010 and 2011 and our January 31, 2014 acquisition of Great Florida Bank ("GFB"), produce a portion of our interest income from the accretable discounts on acquired loans. This accretion will continue to have an impact on our net interest income as long as loans acquired with evidence of credit deterioration at acquisition represent a meaningful portion of our interest-earning assets. 
  Changes in the market interest rates and interest rates we earn on interest-earning assets or pay on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the volume and types of interest-earning assets, interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing liabilities and stockholders  equity, are usually the largest drivers of periodic changes in net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. In addition, our interest income includes the accretion of the fair value discounts on our acquired loans, which will also affect our net interest spread, net interest margin and net interest income. We measure net interest income before and after the provision for loan losses required to maintain our ALL at acceptable levels. 
  Noninterest Income 
  Our noninterest income includes the following: 

Service charges and fees;

    Regulatory assessments and insurance; and 
                
    Amortization of intangibles 
      
  Financial Condition 
  The primary factors we use to evaluate and manage our financial condition include liquidity, asset quality and capital. 
  Liquidity 
  We manage liquidity based upon factors that include the amount of core deposits as a percentage of total deposits, the level of diversification of our funding sources, the allocation and amount of our deposits among deposit types, the short-term funding sources used to fund assets, the amount of non-deposit funding used to fund assets, the availability of unused funding sources, off-balance sheet obligations, the availability of assets to be readily converted into cash without undue loss, the amount of cash and liquid securities we hold, and the re-pricing characteristics and maturities of our assets when compared to the re-pricing characteristics of our liabilities, the ability to securitize and sell certain pools of assets and other factors. 
  Asset Quality 
  We manage the diversification and quality of our assets based upon factors that include the level, distribution, severity and trend of problem, classified, delinquent, nonaccrual, nonperforming and restructured assets, the adequacy of our ALL, discounts and reserves for unfunded loan commitments, the diversification and quality of loan and investment portfolios, the extent of counterparty risks and credit risk concentrations. 
  Capital 
  We manage capital based upon factors that include the level and quality of capital and overall financial condition of the Company, the trend and volume of problem assets, the adequacy of discounts and reserves, the level and quality of earnings, the risk exposures in our balance sheet, the levels of Tier 1 (core), risk-based and tangible equity capital, the ratios of Tier 1 (core), risk-based and tangible equity capital to total assets and risk-weighted assets and other factors. 
   
  Performance Highlights 
  Operating and financial highlights for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   include the following: 

New loan portfolio grew sequentially at an annualized rate of 23% 
                
    Demand deposits grew by $221.7 million, or 58% annualized during the quarter

The increase in other assets consisted primarily of increases in the fair value of interest rate swaps outstanding of $22.5 million. 
  Investment Securities 
  The Company s investment policy has been established by the Board of Directors and dictates that investment decisions will be made based on, among other things, the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, interest rate risk, potential returns, cash flow targets and consistency with its asset/liability management policy. The Bank s Investment Committee is responsible for making investment security portfolio decisions in accordance with the established policies and in coordination with the Board s Asset/Liability Committee. The Bank s Investment Committee members, and Bank employees under the direction of such committee, have been delegated authority to purchase and sell securities within specified investment policy guidelines. Portfolio performance and activity are reviewed by the Bank s Investment Committee and full Board of Directors on a periodic basis. 
    
  The Bank s investment policy provides specific limits on investments depending on a variety of factors, including its asset class, issuer, credit rating, size, maturity, etc. The Bank s current investment strategy includes maintaining a high credit quality, liquid, diversified portfolio invested in fixed and floating rate securities with short- to intermediate-term maturities. The purpose of this approach is to create a safe and sound investment portfolio that minimizes exposure to interest rate and credit risk while providing attractive relative yields given market conditions.

The Company s investment securities portfolio primarily consists of U.S. government agencies and sponsored enterprises obligations and agency mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt, asset-backed securities and preferred stocks. 
  Total investment securities totaled $1.72 billion and $1.58 billion as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  No securities were determined to be other-than-temporary impaired as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  As a member institution of the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB ), the Bank is required to own capital stock in the FHLB and the FRB. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank held approximately $43.5 million and $59.5 million, respectively, in FHLB and FRB stock. No market exists for this stock, and the Bank s investment can be liquidated only through repurchase by the FHLB or FRB. Such repurchases have historically been at par value. We monitor our investment in FHLB and FRB stock for impairment through review of recent financial results, dividend payment history and information from credit agencies. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, management did not identify any indicators of impairment of FHLB and FRB stock. 
  The following table shows contractual maturities and yields on our investment securities available for sale. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. Average yields are not presented on a tax equivalent basis.

    Preferred stock securities are all fixed-to-floating rate perpetual preferred stock that are callable through June 2025. 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , the effective duration of the Company s investment portfolio is estimated to be approximately 2.84 years. This estimate is derived using a variety of inputs that are subject to change based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to, changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds. 
  The average balance of the securities portfolio for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   totaled $1.64 billion with an annualized pre-tax yield of 3.56%. The average balance of the securities portfolio for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   totaled $1.60 billion with an annualized pre-tax yield of 3.60%. 
  Except for securities issued by U.S. government agencies and sponsored enterprise obligations, we did not have any concentrations where the total outstanding balances issued by a single issuer exceeded 10% of our stockholders  equity as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .

Loans 
  Loan concentration 
  The current concentrations in our loan portfolio may not be indicative of concentrations in our loan portfolio in the future. We plan to maintain a relatively diversified loan portfolio to help reduce the risk inherent in concentration in certain types of collateral. 
  The following table summarizes the allocation of New Loans, Acquired ASC 310-30 loans and Acquired Non-ASC 310-30 loans as of the dates presented: 

Total loans were $6.27 billion at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of 20.7% compared to $5.19 billion at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Our New loan portfolio increased by 26.6% to $5.84 billion as of   September 30, 2016  , as compared to $4.61 billion at   December 31, 2015  . The increase during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to an increase in 1-4 single family residential loans and growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. 
  Acquired loans were $431.7 million at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of $150.7 million from $582.4 million at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was primarily due to the run-off of the acquired loan

portfolio through note sales, receipt of payments, loan payoffs and resolutions through foreclosure and transfers to other real estate owned. During the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold approximately $16.5 million and $59.9 million, respectively, of acquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-30. These sales as well as other acquired asset resolutions resulted in proceeds that exceeded the carrying value of the accounting pool in which the loans resided of $7.9 million and $20.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, which was recognized as interest income. 
  Asset Quality 
  The following table sets forth the composition of our nonperforming assets, including nonaccrual loans, accruing loans 90 days or more days past due and foreclosed assets as of the dates indicated: 

Nonaccrual loans totaled $16.9 million at   September 30, 2016  , an decrease of 8.1% from $18.4 million at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Nonperforming assets totaled $42.6 million at   September 30, 2016  , an decrease of $15.1 million, or 26.1%, from   December 31, 2015  . The decrease in nonperforming assets is primarily due to the decrease in OREO of $13.7 million. 
  
   51 

     Table of Contents  

Our policies related to when loans are placed on nonaccrual status conform to guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities. Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when it is probable that principal or interest is not fully collectible, or generally when principal or interest becomes 90 days past due, whichever occurs first. Certain loans past due 90 days or more may remain on accrual status if management determines that it does not have concern over the collectability of principal and interest because the loan is secured by assets with a value in excess of the amounts owed and is in the process of collection. Loans are removed from nonaccrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and concern no longer exists as to the collectability of principal and interest. 
  Loans accounted for under ASC 310-30 that are delinquent and/or on nonaccrual status continue to accrue income provided the respective pool in which those assets reside maintains a discount and recognizes accretion income. The aforementioned loans are characterized as performing loans greater than 90 days past due. If the pool no longer has a discount and accretion income can no longer be recognized, any loan within that pool on nonaccrual status will be classified as nonaccrual for presentation purposes. 
  Loans are identified for restructuring based on their delinquency status, risk rating downgrade, or at the request of the borrower. Borrowers that are 90 days delinquent and/or have a history of being delinquent, or experience a risk rating downgrade, are contacted to discuss options to bring the loan current, cure credit risk deficiencies, or other potential restructuring options that will reduce the inherent risk and improve collectability of the loan. In some instances, a borrower will initiate a request for loan restructure. The Bank requires borrowers to provide current financial information to establish the need for financial assistance and satisfy applicable prerequisite conditions required by the Bank. The Bank may also require the borrower to enter into a forbearance agreement. 
  Modification of loan terms may include the following: reduction of the stated interest rate; extension of maturity date or other payment dates; reduction of the face amount or maturity amount of the loan; reduction in accrued interest; forgiveness of past-due interest; or a combination of the above. 
  The following table sets forth our asset quality ratios for the periods presented: 

Analysis of the Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The ALL reflects management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The computation of the ALL includes elements of judgment and subjectivity. As a portion of the Company s loans were acquired in failed bank acquisitions and were purchased at a substantial discount to their original book value, we segregate loans into three buckets when assessing and analyzing the ALL: New loans, Acquired ASC 310-30 loans, Acquired Non-ASC 310-30 loans.

     Table of Contents  

As of   September 30, 2016  , our New loans have exhibited limited delinquency and credit loss history prohibiting the Company from establishing an observable loss trend. Given this lack of sufficient loss history on the New loan portfolio, general loan loss factors are established based on the following: historical loss factors derived from a peer group of the 17 banks using an annualized weighted average twelve quarter rolling basis. Historical loss factors are adjusted for qualitative factors including trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans, production trends, average risk ratings and loan-to-value ratios, current industry conditions, general economic conditions, credit concentrations by portfolio and asset categories and portfolio quality. Other adjustments for qualitative factors may be made to the ALL after an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality and loss severity that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. The Company uses assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impairment and probable losses in the loan portfolio. To the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations, management s judgment and experience play a role in recording the allowance estimates. 
    
  The ALL increased $6.7 million to $35.8 million at   September 30, 2016   from $29.1 million at   December 31, 2015  , primarily due to the increase in New loans of $1.23 billion. The ALL as a percentage of nonperforming assets and the ALL as a percentage of total gross loans was 83.92% and 0.57% as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to 50.47% and 0.56% at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in the ALL as a percentage of nonperforming assets was primarily the result of a decrease in OREO. The allowance coverage ratio on New loans remained flat over the same period. 
   
  FDIC Loss Share Indemnification Asset 
  On March 4, 2015, the Bank entered into an agreement with the FDIC to terminate all loss sharing agreements which were entered into in 2010 and 2011 in conjunction with the Bank s acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of substantially all of the liabilities of six failed banks in FDIC-assisted acquisitions. Under the early termination, all rights and obligations of the Bank and the FDIC under the loss share agreements, including the clawback provisions, have been eliminated. 
  The Bank paid the FDIC $14.8 million as consideration for the early termination to settle its obligation under the FDIC Clawback Liability. The early termination was recorded in the Bank s financial statements by removing the FDIC Indemnification Asset receivable, the FDIC Clawback liability and recording a one-time, pre-tax loss on termination of $65.5 million.  
  The following tables summarize the activity related to the FDIC loss share indemnification asset for the periods presented:

Total OREO held by the Company was $25.7 million as of   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of $13.7 million from   December 31, 2015  . The decrease in other real estate owned was due to OREO sales of $23.9 million during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   partially offset by $11.3 million in transfers from the loan portfolio. 

Bank-owned Life Insurance 
  BOLI policies are held in order to insure the key officers and employees of the Bank. Per ASC 325-10,  Investments in Insurance Contracts,  this policy is recorded at the cash surrender value adjusted for other charges or other amounts due that are probable at settlement, if applicable. 
  The following table summarizes the changes in the cash surrender value of BOLI for the periods presented: 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the BOLI cash surrender value was $172.1 million and $168.2 million respectively. The company recognized $1.3 million and $1.1 million of BOLI income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 resulting in a pre-tax yield of 3.01% and 2.91%, respectively.  The company recognized $3.9 million and $3.3 million of BOLI income for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 resulting in a pre-tax yield of 3.02% and 3.07%, respectively. The total death benefit of the BOLI policies at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   totaled $523.8 million and $521.8 million, respectively. 

Deposits 
  We expect that deposits will be our primary funding source in the future. We expect commercial core deposits will drive core deposit growth.

The following table shows the deposit mix as of the periods presented: 

Deposits at   September 30, 2016   totaled $6.92 billion, an increase of $1.49 billion, or 27.4%, from   December 31, 2015  . The increase in deposits consisted of a $1.05 billion increase in core deposits and a $434.3 million increase in time deposits. Core deposits include demand deposit, NOW accounts, savings and money market accounts and represents 66.9% of total deposits at   September 30, 2016  , an increase from 65.8% at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The increase in core deposits was primarily due to growth in demand deposits and savings and money market accounts due to retail marketing efforts and commercial relationship growth. The average rate paid on deposits for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was 0.72%. This represents an increase of 13 basis points as compared to the average rate paid on deposits of 0.59% for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The average rate paid on time deposits for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was 1.17%. This represents an increase of 16 basis points compared to the average rate paid on time deposits of 1.01% for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The average rate paid on deposits for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was 0.69%. This represents an increase of 12 basis points as compared to the average rate paid on deposits of 0.57% for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The average rate paid on time deposits for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was 1.15%. This represents an increase of 17 basis points compared to the average rate paid on time deposits of 0.98% for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The following table shows the remaining maturity of time deposits of $100,000 and greater as of the period presented: 

Borrowings 
  In addition to deposits, we utilize advances from the FHLB and other borrowings, such as securities sold under repurchase agreements, as a supplementary funding source to finance our operations. FHLB advances are secured by stock, qualifying first residential mortgages, commercial real estate loans, home equity loans and investment securities.

The decrease in total borrowings was primarily driven by the $406.5 million decrease in FHLB advances and a decrease in securities sold under repurchase agreements of $18.5 million partially offset by an increase in retail repurchase agreement of $12.0 million. 
  Short-term borrowings consist of debt with maturities of one year or less and the current portion of long-term debt. The following table is a summary of short-term borrowings for the periods presented:

  The following table presents the activity during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   related to the Amended 2009 Warrants: 

Capital Resources 
  Our Company and Bank are subject to regulatory capital adequacy requirements promulgated by federal bank regulatory agencies. Failure by our Company or Bank to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements for our Company and the OCC has similar requirements for our Bank.

     Table of Contents  

Information presented for   September 30, 2016  , reflects the Basel III capital requirements that became effective January 1, 2015 for both our Company and Bank. Under these capital requirements and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, our Company and Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of our Company and Bank s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Our Company s and Bank s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. 
  Quantitative measures established by regulation require our Company and Bank to maintain certain minimum capital amounts and ratios. Federal bank regulators require our Company and Bank to maintain minimum ratios of core capital to adjusted average assets of 4.0%, common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5%, tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.0% and total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%. Beginning January 1, 2016, Basel III implemented a capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements in order to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions, stock repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer is exclusively composed of common equity tier 1 capital. Beginning January 1, 2016, the capital conservation buffer is 0.625% for 2016 and increases by 0.625% for each year through 2019. The capital planning process and position is monitored by the Enterprise Risk Committee. 
    
  The Company and Bank s regulatory capital ratios, excluding the impact of the capital conservation buffer, are as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016  , our Company and Bank met all the capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company and Bank were  well capitalized  under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be  well capitalized,  our Company and Bank must maintain minimum leverage, common equity tier 1 risk-based, tier 1 risk-based and total risk-based capital ratios of at least 5.0%, 6.5%, 8.0% and 10.0%, respectively. Management believes that no conditions or events have occurred since   September 30, 2016   that would materially adversely change the Company s or Bank s capital classifications. From time to time, we may need to raise additional capital to support our Company s and Bank s further growth and to maintain their  well capitalized  status. 
  The Bank and, with respect to certain provisions, the Company, is also subject to an Order of the FDIC, dated January 22, 2010, issued in connection with the FDIC s approval of the Bank s application for federal deposit insurance. The Order requires, among other things, the Bank to maintain capital levels sufficient to be well capitalized under regulatory standards during the remaining period of ownership of the investors (as defined in the Order) subject to the SOP. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we believe the Company and Bank both had capital levels that exceeded the regulatory guidelines for a  well capitalized  institution. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.3%, which provided $426.7 million of excess capital relative to the minimum requirements to be considered well capitalized. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 9.6%, which provided $365.0 million of excess capital relative to the minimum requirements to be considered well capitalized. 
   
  Liquidity 
  Liquidity represents the Company s ability to meet financial commitments through the maturity and sale of existing assets or availability of additional funds. Liquidity risk results from the mismatching of asset and liability cash flows. The Bank s  
  
   61 

     Table of Contents  

liquidity needs are primarily met by its cash and securities position, growth in deposits, cash flow from amortizing investment and loan portfolios and borrowings from the FHLB. For additional information regarding our operating, investing, and financing cash flows, see  Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  
  The Bank has access to additional borrowings through secured FHLB advances, unsecured borrowing lines from correspondent banks, and repurchase agreements (secured). In addition, the Bank has an established borrowing line at the Federal Reserve Bank. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had additional capacity to borrow from the FHLB of $1.65 billion. Also, at   September 30, 2016  , the Company has unused credit lines with financial institutions of $70.0 million. 
  We believe the Bank s cash and liquidity resources generated by operations and deposit growth will be sufficient to satisfy the Bank s future funding requirements. The Bank s ongoing liquidity position is monitored by the Asset Liability Committee ( ALCO ) and the Enterprise Risk Committee. 
  As a holding company, we are a corporation separate and apart from our subsidiary, the Bank, and therefore we provide for our own liquidity. Our main sources of funding include equity capital raised in our offerings of equity securities and dividends paid by the Bank, when applicable, and access to capital markets. We believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for the foreseeable future. There are regulatory limitations that affect the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to us. See  Dividend Policy  and  Supervision and Regulation Regulatory Limits on Dividends and Distributions  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   previously filed with the SEC. Management believes that such limitations will not impact our ability to meet our ongoing short-term cash obligations. 
    
  The Company approved a stock repurchase program under which the Company is authorized to acquire up to $70 million of its Class A Common Stock. Repurchases under the program may be made through open market or privately negotiated transactions at times and in such amounts as management deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors. The program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. Shares repurchased under the program will be made using the Company s own cash resources and are expected to be held as treasury shares. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has repurchased $58.7 million of its Class A Common Stock under the stock repurchase program.  
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  In the normal course of business, we enter into various transactions, which, in accordance with GAAP, are not included in our consolidated balance sheets. We enter into these transactions to meet the financing needs of our customers. These transactions include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit, which involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Bank s consolidated balance sheets. We have limited off-balance sheet arrangements that have not had or are not reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, revenues, and expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. 
  We enter into contractual loan commitments to extend credit, normally with fixed expiration dates or termination clauses, at specified rates and for specific purposes. Since a portion of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Substantially all of our commitments to extend credit are contingent upon customers maintaining specific credit standards until the time of loan funding. We decrease our exposure to loss under these commitments by subjecting them to credit approval and monitoring procedures. We assess the credit risk associated with certain commitments to extend credit and establish a liability for probable credit losses. 
  Standby letters of credit are written conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. In the event the customer does not perform in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the third party, we would be required to fund the commitment. The maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make is represented by the contractual amount of the commitment. If the commitment is funded, we would be entitled to seek recovery from the customer. Our policies generally require that standby letter of credit arrangements contain security and debt covenants similar to those contained in loan agreements.

Management believes that we have adequate liquidity to meet all known contractual obligations and unfunded commitments, including loan commitments over the next twelve months. 
   
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  The Company views certain non-recurring items, including but not limited to merger related and restructuring charges, gain/(loss) on investment securities and their corresponding tax effect, as core adjustments to net income. Core adjustments for the   third   quarter of   2016   include $72 thousand of severance expense and a $749 thousand gain on investment securities. 
    
  The following reconciliation provides a more detailed analysis of this non-GAAP financial measure: 

Tangible book value per share is defined as total stockholders  equity reduced by goodwill and other intangible assets divided by total common shares outstanding. This non-GAAP financial measure is important to investors interested in changes from period-to-period in book value per share exclusive of changes in intangible assets.

The following table reconciles this non-GAAP financial measurement of tangible book value per common share to the comparable GAAP financial measurement of book value per common share for the periods presented: 

Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to management and investors that is supplementary to our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows computed in accordance with GAAP. Disclosure of these non-GAAP financial measures is relevant to understanding the capital position and performance of the Company and provides a meaningful base for comparability to other financial institutions. We acknowledge that our non-GAAP financial measures have a number of limitations. As such, you should not view these disclosures as a substitute for results determined in accordance with GAAP. 
   
  Item 3.        Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
  As described in more detail in Part II, Item 7A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , risk management involves the monitoring and evaluation of interest rate risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, compliance risk and strategic and/or reputation risk. The Company has not experienced any material change in these risks from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  . For additional disclosure of our market risks, see the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   previously filed with the SEC. 
   
  Item 4.        Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has evaluated the effectiveness of its  disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

PART II.     OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.        Legal Proceedings 
  The Company, from time to time, is involved as plaintiff or defendant in various legal actions arising in the normal course of business. While the ultimate outcome of any such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, it is the opinion of management, based upon advice of legal counsel, that no proceedings exist, either individually or in the aggregate, which, if determined adversely to the Company, would have a material effect on the Company s consolidated balance sheet, statements of income or cash flows. See Note 12  Commitments and Contingencies  in the  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
