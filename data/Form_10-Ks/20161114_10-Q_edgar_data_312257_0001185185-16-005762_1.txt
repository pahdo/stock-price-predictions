1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries, some of which are non-operating, Artisan Specialty Foods, Inc. ( Artisan ), Food Innovations, Inc. ( Food Innovations  or  FII ), Food New Media Group, Inc. ( FNM ), Organic Food Brokers, Inc. ( OFB ), Gourmet Food Service Group, Inc. ( GFG ), Gourmet Foodservice Warehouse, Inc., Gourmeting, Inc., The Haley Group, Inc. ( Haley ), 4 The Gourmet, Inc.

All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities.

The accompanying unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company, in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles pursuant to Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission and with the instructions to Form 10-Q.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted. Accordingly, these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and related notes as contained in Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. In the opinion of management, the interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, including normal recurring adjustments, necessary for fair presentation of the interim periods presented. The results of the operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the full year.

Additionally, these assets and liabilities have been presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.  See Note 3 - Discontinued Operations for additional information.

2. NATURE OF ACTIVITIES AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates include certain assumptions related to doubtful accounts receivable, stock-based services, valuation of financial instruments, and income taxes. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Accounts subject to estimate and judgements are accounts receivable reserves, income taxes, intangible assets, contingent liabilities, and equity based instruments. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.

Principles of Consolidation 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc., and its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Artisan, Food Innovations, FNM, OFB, GFG, Gourmet Foodservice Warehouse, Inc., Gourmeting, Inc., Haley, and Gourmet.  All accounts of FD have been included under discontinued operations.  All material intercompany transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation of these entities.

Concentration Risk   

Cash includes amounts deposited in financial institutions in excess of insurable Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) limits. At times throughout the year, the Company may maintain cash balances in certain bank accounts in excess of FDIC limits. As of September 30, 2016, the cash balance in excess of the FDIC limits was $1,448,028. The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts and believes it is not exposed to any significant credit risk in these accounts. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenue upon product delivery. All of our products are shipped either same day or overnight or through longer shipping terms to the customer and the customer takes title to product and assumes risk and ownership of the product when it is delivered. Shipping charges to customers and sales taxes collectible from customers, if any, are included in revenues. 

For revenue from product sales, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board  FASB  Accounting Standards Codification  ASC  605-15-05. ASC 605-15-05 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred; (3) the selling   price is fixed and  determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.  Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts.  Provisions for discounts and rebates to customers, estimated returns and allowances, and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded.  The Company defers any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the Company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required.    

Cost of Goods Sold   

We have included in cost of goods sold all costs which are directly related to the generation of revenue. These costs include primarily the cost of food and raw materials,  packing and handling, shipping, and delivery costs.

Basic and Diluted Earnings Per Share   

Basic net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period, while fully-diluted net income (loss) per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially dilutive securities assumed to be outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Potentially dilutive securities consist of options and warrants to purchase common stock, and convertible debt. Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.

The Company uses the treasury stock method to calculate the impact of outstanding stock options and warrants. Stock options and warrants for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common share and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, the company did not include the following in the calculation of weighted-average fully-diluted shares outstanding because the result would have been anti-dilutive: 2,742,503 shares underlying warrants and 1,475,000 shares underlying options.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the company did not include the following in the calculation of weighted-average fully-diluted shares outstanding because the result would have been anti-dilutive: 2,294,493 shares underlying warrants and 1,290,000 shares underlying options. 

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, fully-diluted earnings per share was the same as basic earnings per share because the effect of the exercise of any of the dilutive securities would have been anti-dilutive, and the following were  not  included in the calculation of fully-diluted earnings per share: 5,682,320 shares underlying convertible notes payable and accrued interest; 3,120,000 shares from the exercise of options; and 3,537,286 shares from the exercise of warrants.

Certain of the RSUs were issued to employees of The Fresh Diet ( Employee RSUs ) and certain RSUs were issued to the executive officers of the Company ( Executive RSUs ) and certain RSUs were issued to members of the board of directors of the Company ( Board RSUs ).

The FD RSUs issued to certain nonexecutive employees of FD were issued either partially in lieu of salary, future bonuses, or a combination of both bonus and salary.

The Company estimated that the revenue targets had a 100% likelihood of achievement, and these RSUs were valued at 100% of their face value.  We recognized stock-based compensation expense of in a straight-line manner over the vesting period of the RSUs. This resulted in stock-based compensation expense of $1,128,170 and $3,287,219 respectively, related to recognition of RSUs during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Fully-diluted earnings per share was the same as basic earnings per share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 because the effect of the exercise of above instruments would be anti-dilutive.

Significant Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-2, which creates ASC Topic 842,  Leases.  This update increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-9, which amends ASC Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation.  This amendment simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 which amends ASC Topic 230,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The amendments in this Update address eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The update outlines the classification of specific transactions as either cash inflows or outflows from financing activities, operating activities, investing activities or non-cash activities. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are evaluating what impact, if any, the adoption of this guidance will have on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or financial disclosures.

Management does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting standards if currently adopted would have a material effect on the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

3.  DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

Effective February 23, 2016, the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of its ownership in FD  to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD prior thereto.  The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances. There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.

ASC 360-10-45-9 requires that a long-lived asset (disposal group) to be sold shall be classified as held for sale in the period in which a set of criteria have been met, including criteria that the sale of the asset (disposal group) is probable and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. This criteria was achieved on February 9, 2016. Additionally, the discontinued operations are comprised of the entirety of The Fresh Diet, excluding corporate services expenses. Lastly, for comparability purposes certain prior period line items relating to the assets held for sale have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

As detailed in ASC 350, the Company tests for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and may not be recoverable.  As detailed in ASC 350-20-35-3A, in performing its testing for goodwill impairment, management has completed a qualitative analysis to determine whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. To complete this review, management followed the steps in ASC 350-20-35-3C to evaluate the fair value of goodwill and considered all known events and circumstances that might trigger an impairment of goodwill. The analysis completed in 2015 determined that there was no impairment to goodwill assets related to the Artisan and Haley transactions.

The safe harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act will not apply to certain   forward looking statements  because we issued  penny stock  (as defined in Section 3(a)(51) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 3(a)(51-1) under the Exchange Act) during the three year period preceding the date(s) on which those forward looking statements were first made, except to the extent otherwise specifically provided by rule, regulation or order of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution readers that certain important factors may affect our actual results and could cause such results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements which may be deemed to have been made in this Report or which are otherwise made by or on our behalf.

Factors that may affect our results include, but are not limited to, the risks and uncertainties associated with:

Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates  

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements  

The preparation of these financial statements included in this report requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates include certain assumptions related to doubtful accounts receivable, stock-based services, valuation of financial instruments, and income taxes. On an on-going basis, we evaluate these estimates, including those related to revenue recognition and concentration of credit risk. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe our estimates have not been materially inaccurate in past years, and our assumptions are not likely to change in the foreseeable future.

Doubtful Accounts Receivable  

The Company maintained an allowance in the amount of $56,371  for doubtful accounts receivable at September 30, 2016, and $29,429 at September 30, 2015. The Company has an operational relationship of several years with our major customers, and we believe this experience provides us with a solid foundation from which to estimate our expected losses on accounts receivable. Should our sales mix change or if we develop new lines of business or new customers, these estimates and our estimation process will change accordingly. These estimates have been accurate in the past.

Income Taxes  

The Company has a history of losses, and as such has recorded no liability for income taxes. Until such time as the Company begins to provide evidence that a continued profit is a reasonable expectation, management will not determine that there is a basis for accruing an income tax liability. These estimates have been accurate in the past.

Background  

We were initially formed in June 1979 as Alpha Solarco Inc., a Colorado corporation. From June 1979 through February 2003, we were either inactive or involved in discontinued business ventures. We changed our name to Fiber Application Systems Technology, Ltd in February 2003. In January 2004, we changed our state of incorporation by merging into Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. (IVFH), a Florida corporation formed for that purpose. As a result of the merger, we changed our name to that of Innovative Food Holdings, Inc. In January 2004, we also acquired Food Innovations, Inc. ( FII  or  Food Innovations ), a Delaware corporation, for 500,000 shares of our common stock.

On May 18, 2012, the Company executed a Stock Purchase Agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of Artisan Specialty Foods, Inc., an Illinois corporation ( Artisan ), from its owner, Mr. David Vohaska.  The purchase price was $1.2 million, with up to another $300,000 (with a fair value of $131,000) payable in the event certain financial milestones were  met over the next one or two years.  Those milestones have been met. The purchase price was primarily financed via a loan from Alpha Capital in the principal amount of $1,200,000. The loan was repaid in November 2013 via the issuance of a loan from Fifth Third Bank which has been paid in full.  Prior to the acquisition, Artisan was a supplier and had sold products to the Company.

Pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, effective November 2, 2012, the Company purchased the outstanding assets of The Haley Group, LLC ( Haley ). Pursuant to a purchase agreement, effective June 30, 2014, the Company purchased 100% of the membership interest of Organic Food Brokers, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company ( OFB ).

On August 15, 2014, pursuant to a merger agreement (the  Fresh Diet Merger Agreement ), the Company acquired The Fresh Diet, Inc. ( The Fresh Diet  or  FD ) through a reverse triangular merger as the registrant created a subsidiary corporation (FD Acquisition Corp) that merged with and into FD with FD being the surviving corporation and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The purchase price consisted of 10,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock valued at $14,000,000. The majority of FD s current liabilities consisted of approximately $3.8 million of deferred revenues and approximately $2.1 million in short term commercial loans and there were additional ordinary course of business expenses such as trade payables, payroll and sales taxes which varied  from month to month. In addition, it had  some long term obligations the bulk of which consisted of interest free loans from FD s former shareholders in the amount of approximately $2.2 million which were  not due for three years.  Prior to the merger FD had purchased an immaterial amount of product from the Company.  FD operated as an independent subsidiary subject to oversight of its board of directors and the Company s President and CEO.  Effective February 23, 2016,  the Company closed a transaction to sell 90% of our ownership in FD to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD who was appointed Interim CEO of FD on February 9, 2016.  The consideration to Innovative Food Holdings consisted primarily of a restructuring of our loans, which includes the ability to convert to additional amounts of FD under certain circumstances.  The Company considers the ultimate collection of these notes to be doubtful, and they have been fully reserved on the Company s balance sheet at September 30, 2016.  There is no continuing cash inflows or outflows from or to the discontinued operations.

Transactions With a Major Customer 

Transactions with a major customer and related economic dependence information is set forth immediately below and above in Note 2 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and also in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (1) following our discussion of Liquidity and Capital Resources, (2) Concentrations of Credit Risk in Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and (3) as the fourth item under Risk Factors.

Relationship with U.S. Foods

We have historically sold the majority of our products through a distributor relationship between FII and U.S. Foods, a leading broadline distributor.  These sales amounted to $6,546,697 (72% of total sales) and $5,761,640 (72% of total sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and $18,352,407 (72% of total sales) and $15,927,510 (72% of total sales) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. On January 26, 2015 we executed a contract between Food Innovations, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, and U.S. Foods.  The term of the Agreement is from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016 and provides for up to three (3) automatic annual renewals thereafter if no party gives the other 30 days  notice of its intent not to renew. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Prior year balances have been recast to reflect the sale of 90% of our interest in The Fresh Diet, Inc. in February 2016.  Results of discontinued operations are excluded from the accompanying results of operations for all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.  See Note 3   discontinued operations in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.

This discussion may contain forward looking-statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our future results could differ materially from the forward looking-statements discussed in this report. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, the notes thereto and other financial information included elsewhere in the report.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015

Revenue 

Revenue increased by $1,068,671 or approximately 13% to $9,094,443 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $8,025,772 in the prior year. 

We continue to assess the potential of new revenue sources from the manufacture and sale of proprietary food products and additional sales channel opportunities in both the foodservice and consumer space and will implement that strategy if, based on our analysis, we deem it beneficial to us.

Any changes in the food distribution and specialty foods operating landscape that materially hinders our current ability and/or cost to deliver our products to our customers could potentially cause a material impact on our net revenue and gross margin and, therefore, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected.

Currently, a small portion of our revenues comes from imported products or international sales. Our current sales from such segments may be hampered and negatively impacted by any economic tariffs that may be imposed in the United States or in foreign countries.

See  Transactions with Major Customers  and the Securities and Exchange Commission s ( SEC ) mandated FR-60 disclosures following the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section for a further discussion of the significant customer concentrations, loss of significant customer, critical accounting policies and estimates, and other factors that could affect future results.

Cost of goods sold 

Our cost of goods sold for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,404,185, an increase of $732,471 or approximately 13% compared to cost of goods sold of $5,671,714 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in sales during the period.  Cost of goods sold is made up of the following expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016: cost of goods of specialty, meat, game, cheese, seafood, poultry and other sales categories in the amount of $4,648,891; and shipping, delivery, handling, and purchase allowance expenses in the amount of $1,755,294.  Total gross margin was approximately 29.6% of sales in 2016, compared to approximately 29.3% of sales in 2015. The increase  in gross margins from 2015 are primarily attributable to variation in product and revenue mix across our various selling channels.

Table of Contents 

In 2016, we continued to price our products in order to gain market share, optimize gross profit dollars and increase the number of our end users. We were successful in both increasing sales and increasing market share.  We currently expect, if market conditions and our product revenue mix remain constant, that our cost of goods sold will either remain stable or possibly improve slightly.

The decrease was due to a decrease of $105,855 in amortization of the discount on notes payable during the period.  Approximately 25% or $30,367 of the interest expense was accrued or paid interest on the company s notes payable; approximately 75% or $92,509 of the interest was a non-cash GAAP accounting charge associated with the amortization of the discounts on the Company s notes payable.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had cash provided by operating activities of $1,563,446.  This consisted of the Company s consolidated net income of $6,269,795, reduced by gain on sale of discontinued operations of $7,201,196, and increased by stock based compensation in the amount of $1,702,431  (including $1,028,908 charged to discontinued operations); amortization of discount on notes payable of $277,527; depreciation and amortization of $409,228; and increase in allowance for bad debt of $11,963.

The Company had cash used in investing activities of $480,994 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which consisted of $470,482 cash disposed in the sale of discontinued operations, and $10,512 for the acquisition of property and equipment.

The Company had a net working capital of $1,295,267  as of September 30, 2016. We generated positive cash flow from operating activities of $1,563,446  for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We generated negative  cash flow from operations during the year ended December 31, 2015, which includes the results of The Fresh Diet.   The Company intends to continue to focus on increasing market share and cash flow from operations by focusing its sales activities on specific market segments and new product lines.  Currently, we do not have any material long-term obligations other than those described in Note 12 to the financial statements included in this report. As we seek to increase our sales of new items and enter new markets, acquire new businesses as well as identify new and other consumer and food service oriented products and services, we may use existing cash reserves, long-term financing, or other means to finance such diversification.

Table of Contents 

In February 2016, we completed the sale of The Fresh Diet to New Fresh Co., LLC, a Florida limited liability company controlled by the former founder of FD.  See Note 3.  

In August 2016, we entered into a term loan agreement with Fifth Third Bank, and transferred the amount of $1,200,000 from our line of credit with Fifth Third Bank into this Term Loan Agreement.  The line of credit with Fifth Third Bank was then renewed for an additional year. See Note 12.

If the Company s cash flow from operations is insufficient, the Company may require additional financing in order to execute its operating plan and continue as a going concern.  The Company cannot predict whether this additional financing will be in the form of equity or debt, or be in another form. The Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. The Company expects that any sale of additional equity securities or convertible debt will result in additional dilution to our stockholders.

In any of these events, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay its debt obligations as they become due or respond to competitive pressures, any of which circumstances would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The Company has not made any adjustments to the financial statements which would be necessary should the Company not be able to continue as a going concern. 

2016 Plans

During 2016, in addition to our efforts to increase sales in our existing foodservice operations we plan to attempt to expand our business by expanding our focus to additional specialty foods markets in both the consumer and foodservice sector, explore  potential acquisition opportunities and continue  to extend our focus in the  specialty food market through the growth of the Company s existing sales channels and through a variety of  additional sales channel relationships which are currently being explored. In addition, we are currently exploring the introduction of a variety of new product categories and new product lines, to leverage our existing foodservice and consumer customer base.

No assurances can be given that any of these plans will come to fruition or that if implemented that they will necessarily yield positive results.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.

Inflation

In the opinion of management, inflation has not had a material effect on the Company s financial condition or results of its operations.

RISK FACTORS

The Company s business and success is subject to numerous risk factors as detailed in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 which is available at no cost at   www.sec.gov  .
