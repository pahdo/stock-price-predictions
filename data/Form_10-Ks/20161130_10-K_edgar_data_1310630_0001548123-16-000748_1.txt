The Registrant s shares were last sold at a price of $1.01 per share.   Although the Registrant s stock has very few trades and limited volume, based on the last sales price of $1.01 shares held by non-affiliates would have a market value of $253,425.       As of November 21, 2016, the Registrant had 5,251,309 shares of common stock issued and outstanding.        DOCUMENTS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE        If the following documents are incorporated by reference, briefly describe them and identify the part of the Form 10-K (e.g., Part I, Part II, etc.) into which the document is incorporated: (1) any annual report to security holders; (2) any proxy or information statement, and (3) any prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the Securities Act of 1933 ( Securities Act ). The listed documents should be clearly described for identification purposes: None                   PART I         Item 1. Business        The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Utah on October 25, 1972, under the name of Electronic Agricultural Machinery Development Corporation.  In 1974, the Company changed its name to Zenith Development Corporation.  In 1980, the Company changed its name to Alternative Energy Resources, Inc.  In 2004, the Company changed its name to Trafalgar Resources, Inc.       Initially, the Company sought to develop and market inventions, including an asparagus harvester, a hot water saving device and a gas alert signal.  Ultimately, none of the inventions were successful and they were abandoned. The Company ceased to conduct any business and has not conducted any business during the last three years.       Currently, the Company is in the process of investigating potential business ventures which, in the opinion of management, will provide a source of eventual profit to the Company.  Such involvement may take many forms, including the acquisition of an existing business or the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses.  All risks inherent in new and inexperienced enterprises are inherent in the Company s business.        The Company is not currently conducting any business, nor has it conducted any business for several years. Therefore, it does not possess products or services, distribution methods, competitive business positions, or major customers.  The Company does not possess any unexpired patents or trademarks and any and all of its licensing and royalty agreements from the inventions it sought to market in the past have since expired, and are not currently valid. The Company does not employ any employees.            The selection of a business opportunity in which to participate is complex and risky. Additionally, as the Company has only limited resources, it may be difficult to find good opportunities.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to identify and acquire any business opportunity which will ultimately prove to be beneficial to the Company and its stockholders. The Company will select any potential business opportunity based on management's business judgment.       The activities of the Company are subject to several significant risks which arise primarily as a result of the fact that the Company has no specific business and may acquire or participate in a business opportunity based on the decision of management which potentially could act without the consent, vote, or approval of the Company's stockholders.  The risks faced by the Company are further increased as a result of its lack of resources and its inability to provide a prospective business opportunity with significant capital.        Item 2. Properties        The Company owns no properties and utilizes space on a rent-free basis in the office of its principal stockholder, Anthony Brandon Escobar.  This arrangement is expected to continue until such time as the Company becomes involved in a business venture which necessitates its relocation, as to which no assurances can be given.  The Company has no agreements with respect to the maintenance or future acquisition of the office facilities; however, if a successful merger/acquisition is negotiated, it is anticipated that the office of the Company will be moved to that of the acquired company.         The Company is not actively engaged in conducting any business.  Rather, the Company is in the process of investigating potential business ventures which, in the opinion of management, will provide a source of eventual profit to the Company.  Therefore, the Company does not presently intend to invest in real estate or real estate securities, nor has it formulated any investment policies regarding investments in real estate, real estate mortgages, or securities of or interests in persons engaged in real estate activities.         Item 3. Legal Proceedings        None.        Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures        The Company has no mining operations.        -3-              PART II         Item 5. Market for Registrant s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.        The Company s common stock is quoted on the OTCQB under the symbol  TFLG.   Set forth below are the high and low bid prices for the Company's Common Stock for the respective quarters.  Although the Company's common stock is quoted on the OTCQB it has traded sporadically with no real volume and there is currently no ask price.  Consequently, the information provided below may not be indicative of the Company's common stock price under different conditions.             At November 21, 2016, the bid and ask price for the Company's Common Stock was $1.01 and $0.55.  All prices listed herein reflect inter-dealer prices, without retail mark-up, mark-down or commissions and may not represent actual transactions.        Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities        The Company had no sales of securities in 2016 or 2015.           Holders     At November 21, 2016, the Company had approximately 229 shareholders of record and beneficial owners based on information obtained from the Company s transfer agent.         Dividends     Since its inception, the Company has not paid any dividends on its common stock and the Company does not anticipate that it will pay dividends in the foreseeable future.        -4-              Item 6.  Selected Financial Data         Summary of Financial Information        We had no revenues in 2016 or 2015.  We had a net loss of $48,949 for the year ended September 30, 2016.  At September 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $15,191 and negative working capital of $220,930.       The following table shows selected summarized financial data for the Company at the dates and for the periods indicated. The data should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included herein beginning on page F-1.        STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS DATA :              Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.          Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements         This annual report contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 with respect to the Plan of Operation provided below, including information regarding the Company s financial condition, results of operations, business strategies, operating efficiencies or synergies, competitive positions, growth opportunities, plans and objectives of management. The statements made as part of the Plan of Operation that are not historical facts are hereby identified as  forward-looking statements.         PLAN OF OPERATION.        The Company is in the process of investigating potential business ventures which, in the opinion of management, will provide a source of eventual profit to the Company.  Such involvement may take many forms, including the acquisition of an existing business or the acquisition of assets to establish subsidiary businesses.  The Company s management does not expect to remain involved as management of any acquired business.       As the Company possesses limited funds, the Company will be extremely limited in its attempts to locate potential business situations for investigation.  The Company intends to commence, on a limited basis, the process of investigating possible merger and acquisition candidates, and believes that the Company s status as a publicly-held corporation will enhance its ability to locate such potential business ventures.  No assurance can be given as to         -5-         when the Company may locate suitable business opportunities and such opportunities may be difficult to locate; however, the Company intends to actively search for potential business ventures for the foreseeable future.         Management anticipates that due to its lack of funds, and the limited amount of its resources, the Company may be restricted to participation in only one potential business venture.  This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk because it will not permit the Company to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.       Business opportunities, if any arise, are expected to become available to the Company principally from the personal contacts of its officers and directors.  While it is not expected that the Company will engage professional firms specializing in business acquisitions or reorganizations, such firms may be retained if funds become available in the future, and if deemed advisable.  Opportunities may thus become available from professional advisors, securities broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community, and other sources of unsolicited proposals. In certain circumstances, the Company may agree to pay a finder s fee or other form of compensation, including perhaps one-time cash payments, payments based upon a percentage of revenues or sales volume, and/or payments involving the issuance of securities, for services provided by persons who submit a business opportunity in which the Company shall decide to participate, although no contracts or arrangements of this nature presently exist.  The Company is unable to predict at this time the cost of locating a suitable business opportunity.       The analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company s management, none of whom is a professional analyst and none of whom have significant general business experience.  Among the factors which management will consider in analyzing potential business opportunities are the available technical, financial and managerial resources; working capital and financial requirements; the history of operation, if any; future prospects; the nature of present and anticipated competition; potential for further research, developments or exploration; growth and expansion potential; the perceived public recognition or acceptance of products or services; name identification, and other relevant factors.         It is not possible at present to predict the exact matter in which the Company may participate in a business opportunity.  Specific business opportunities will be reviewed and, based upon such review, the appropriate legal structure or method of participation will be decided upon by management.  Such structures and methods may include, without limitation, leases, purchase and sale agreements, licenses, joint ventures; and may involve merger, consolidation or reorganization.  The Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or reorganization.  However, it is most likely that any acquisition of a business venture the Company would make would be by conducting a reorganization involving the issuance of the Company s restricted securities. Such a reorganization may involve a merger (or combination pursuant to state corporate statutes, where one of the entities dissolves or is absorbed by the other), or it may occur as a consolidation, where a new entity is formed and the Company and such other entity combine assets in the new entity.  A reorganization may also occur, directly or indirectly, through subsidiaries, and there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity.  Any such reorganization could result in loss of control of a majority of the shares.  The Company s present directors may be required to resign in connection with a reorganization.         The Company may choose to enter into a venture involving the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but desires to establish a public trading market of its securities.  Such a company may desire to consolidate its operations with the Company through a merger, reorganization, asset acquisition, or other combination, in order to avoid possible adverse consequences of undertaking its own public offering.  (Such consequences might include expense, time delays or loss of voting control.)  In the event of such a merger, the Company may be required to issue significant additional shares, and it may be anticipated that control over the Company s affairs may be transferred to others.       As part of their investigation of acquisition possibilities, the Company s management may meet with executive officers of the business and its personnel; inspect its facilities; obtain independent analysis or verification of the information provided, and conduct other reasonable measures, to the extent permitted by the Company s limited resources and management s limited expertise.  Generally, the Company intends to analyze and make a determination based upon all available information without reliance upon any single factor as controlling.         In all likelihood, the Company s management will be inexperienced in the areas in which potential businesses will be investigated and in which the Company may make an acquisition or investment.  Thus, it may become necessary for the Company to retain consultants or outside professional firms to assist management in evaluating potential investments.  The Company can give no assurance that it will be able to find suitable consultants or managers.  The         -6-         Company has no policy regarding the use of consultants, however, if management, in its discretion, determines that it is in the best interests of the Company, management may seek consultants to review potential merger or acquisitions candidates.  There are currently no contracts or agreements between any consultant and any companies that are searching for  shell  companies with which to merge.        It may be anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention, and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys and others.  Should a decision thereafter be made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, it is likely that costs already expended would not be recoverable.  It is likely, in the event a transaction should eventually fail to be consummated, for any reason, that the costs incurred by the Company would not be recoverable.  The Company s officers and directors are entitled to reimbursement for all expenses incurred in their investigation of possible business ventures on behalf of the Company, and no assurance can be given that if the Company has available funds they will not be depleted in such expenses.         Based on current economic and regulatory conditions, management believes that it is possible, if not probable, for a company like the Company, without many assets or many liabilities, to negotiate a merger or acquisition with a viable private company.  The opportunity arises principally because of the high legal and accounting fees and the length of time associated with the registration process of  going public.   However, should any of these conditions change, it is very possible that there would be little or no economic value for anyone taking over control of the Company.        LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES        As of September 30, 2016, the Company had $15,191 in cash and liabilities of $268,621.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a negative working capital of $220,930. The Company had a negative working capital of $171,981 as of September 30, 2015.  The Company has only incidental ongoing expenses primarily associated with maintaining its corporate status and maintaining the Company s reporting obligations to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Current management has indicated a willingness to help support the Company s ongoing expenses through the purchase of securities of the Company.       For the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had $26,782 in general and administrative expenses related to maintaining its corporate status, paying accounting and legal fees and $22,067 in interest expenses. Management anticipates only nominal continuing expenses related to investigating business opportunities and legal and accounting cost. For the year ended September 30, 2016, the Company had a net loss of $48,949 compared to a loss of $45,015 for the year ended September 30, 2015.       Since inception, the Company has not generated significant revenue, and it is unlikely that any revenue will be generated until the Company locates a business opportunity with which to acquire or merge.  Management of the Company will be investigating various business opportunities.  These efforts may cost the Company not only out of pocket expenses for its management but also expenses associated with legal and accounting costs.  There can be no guarantee that the Company will receive any benefits from the efforts of management to locate business opportunities.        Management does not anticipate employing any employees in the future until a merger or acquisition can be accomplished.  Management will continue to rely on outside consultants to assist in its corporate filing requirements.          -7-              RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        The Company has not had any revenue since inception.  The Company continues to suffer a small loss related to maintaining its corporate status and reporting obligations.  For the year ended September 30, 2016, we incurred a loss of $48,949 and had no revenue as compared to a loss of $45,015 for the year ended September 30, 2015, with no revenue.        Off-balance sheet arrangements.        The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements and it is not anticipated that the Company will enter into any off-balance sheet arrangements.        Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data        The Company s financial statements are presented immediately following the signature page to this Form 10-K.        Item 9. Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure         The Company has had no disagreements with its principal independent accountants with respect to accounting practices or procedures or financial disclosure.        Item 9A. Controls and Procedures          Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures          Our management, including our CEO and Principal Financial Officer,  evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our CEO and Principal Financial Officer concluded that due to the small size of the Company and lack of segregation of duties our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report were not effective such that the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure. A controls system cannot provide absolute assurance, however, that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within a company have been detected.  However, management believes the controls and procedures provide a reasonable basis for the conclusions.                Management s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting          Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.              Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.              Our management evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016.  In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission ( COSO ) in Internal Control - Integrated Framework.   Further, our management considered the lack of operations and revenue, the limited cash on hand and the limited transactions which occur on a monthly basis.  Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the small size of the Company and lack of segregation of duties.               -8-          This annual report does not include an attestation report of the Company s registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.  Management s report was not subject to attestation by the Company s registered public accounting firm since the Company is not an accelerated or larger accelerated filer.         Changes in internal control over financial reporting        There have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal control over financial reporting.        Item 9B. Other Information        None        PART III         Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers, and Corporate Governance        The following table sets forth as of November 21, 2016, the name, age, and position of each executive officer and director and the term of office of each director of the Company.

               Heaton   Company, PLLC                    REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM         Kristofer Heaton, CPA   William R. Denney, CPA                           To The Board of Directors and Stockholders of   Trafalgar Resources, Inc.       We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Trafalgar Resources, Inc. (the Company) as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related statements of operations, stockholders  equity (deficit) and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.       We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States of America). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Trafalgar Resources, Inc. as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern.  As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company has negative working capital and has not generated revenues to cover operating expenses.  These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Management s plans in regard to this matter are also described in Note 1.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.           /s/Heaton   Company, PLLC   Farmington, Utah   November 29, 2016         240 N.

Notes to Financial Statements    September 30, 2016        Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies         Organization and Operations        Trafalgar Resources, Inc. (the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Utah on October 25, 1972. The Company is considered a development stage enterprise because since October 1, 2003 it has not commenced operations that have resulted in significant revenue and the Company's efforts have been devoted primarily to activities related to raising capital and attempting to acquire an operating entity.        Cash and Cash Equivalents        The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.         Use of estimates        These financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and require that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The use of estimates and assumptions may also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates or assumptions.        Net loss per share of common stock        The loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net loss during the period presented by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during that same period.         Income taxes        We account for income taxes in accordance with FASB ASC 740-10-05,  Accounting for Income Taxes . Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.  Deferred tax assets will be reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized.  A valuation allowance has currently been recorded to reduce our deferred tax asset to $0.            F-6              TRAFALGAR RESOURCES, INC.    Notes to Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (continued)        Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (continued)         Revenue recognition        We will recognize revenue in accordance with FASB ASC 605,  Revenue Recognition.   Under FASB ASC 605, revenue is recognized at the point of passage to the customer of title and risk of loss, when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement, the sales price is determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.  We recognize revenue as services are provided.  Revenues are reflected net of coupon discounts.        Fair value of financial instruments        The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.  The carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash and cash equivalents, and other current assets, accounts payable, taxes payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.         Going concern        As shown in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had a working capital deficit and a retained deficit incurred through September 30, 2016 which raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.  Management intends to seek new capital from a related party to provide needed funds.          New accounting pronouncements        The Company has reviewed Accounting Standards Updates ( ASU ) through ASU No. 2016-15, which contain technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance to specialized industries or entities were recently issued. These updates have no current applicability to the Company or their effect on the financial statements would not have been significant.         NOTE 2:     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS        At September 30, 2016 the Company owed $77,889 of interest and $190,000 to its President.  Note 1 is for $10,000 and bears interest of 4.5% per year.

Notes to Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (continued)        NOTE 2:     RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (continued)        Note 7 is for $20,000 and bears interest of 8.0% per year.  Interest of $1,600 was due on March 1, 2014.  Interest and principal of $21,600 was due on March 1, 2015. Note 7 is in default resulting in a 12% default rate of interest accruing.         Note 8 is for $20,000 and bears interest of 8.0% per year.  Interest of $1,600 was due February 3, 2015.  Interest and principal of $21,600 was due on February 3, 2016. Note 8 is in default resulting in a 12% default rate of interest accruing.       Note 9 is for $30,000 and bears interest of 8.0% per year. Interest of $2,400 is due December 12, 2016.  Interest and principal of $32,400 is due December 12, 2016. Note 10 is for $30,000 and bears interest of 8.0% per year.  Interest of $2,400 is due January 5, 2017.  Interest and principal of $32,400 is due January 5, 2018.         Notes payable   related party are due as follows:        2017: $130,000   2018:     30,000        NOTE 3:   INCOME TAXES         Deferred taxes are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.  Income tax periods 2013, 2014 and 2015 are open for examination by taxing authorities.       The income tax expense (benefit) for the year ended September 30, 2016 differs from the amount computed using the federal statutory rates as follows:         Deferred tax assets for the quarter ending September 30, 2016 are comprised primarily of the following:         At September 30, 2016 the Company had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $210,000 that may be offset against future taxable income through 2036.  These losses will start to expire in the year 2016 through 2036.  No tax benefit has been reported in the financial statements because the Company believes that it is more likely than not that the carryforwards will expire unused.  The utilization of future losses may be limited under various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code pertaining to continuity of business operations limits and substantial changes in ownership.  Accordingly, the potential tax benefits of the loss carryforwards are offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.  The valuation allowance increased during the year ended September 30, 2016 by approximately $17,500.        F-8              TRAFALGAR RESOURCES, INC.    Notes to Financial Statements   September 30, 2016   (continued)        Note 4:  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS        The Company has evaluated subsequent events from the balance sheet date and through the date the financial statements were issued.  During this period the Company did not have any material recognizable subsequent events.                F-9
