  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

1. Organization and Business    
    
  HC2 Holdings, Inc. ( HC2  and, together with its subsidiaries, the  Company ,  we , "us" and  our ) is a diversified holding company which seeks to acquire and grow attractive businesses that the Company believes can generate long-term sustainable free cash flow and attractive returns. While the Company generally intends to acquire controlling equity interests in its operating subsidiaries, the Company also invests to a more limited extent in a variety of debt instruments or noncontrolling equity interest positions. HC2's common stock trades on the NYSE MKT LLC under the symbol  HCHC .  
    
  The Company currently has   seven   reportable segments based on management s organization of the enterprise - Manufacturing, Marine Services, Insurance, Utilities, Telecommunications, Life Sciences, and Other which includes operations that do not meet the separately reportable segment thresholds.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
    
  Basis of Presentation  
    
     The accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) regulations. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such principles and regulations. In the opinion of management, the financial statements reflect all adjustments (all of which are of a normal and recurring nature), which are necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, cash flows and comprehensive income (loss) for the interim periods. The results for the Company s   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the calendar year ending   December 31, 2016  . The financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements included in the Company s most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation    
    
     The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and all other subsidiaries over which the Company exerts control. All intercompany profits, transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a   100%   interest in the Insurance Companies, a   100%   interest in ICS, a   95%   interest in GMSL, a   92%   interest in DBM Global, a   56%   interest in DMi, a   72%   interest in NerVve, and board control of, and a   49.99%   interest in ANG. Because the Company controls the operations of ANG through its control of the board, the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of ANG are included in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Through its subsidiary, Pansend, the Company has a   77%   interest in Genovel Orthopedics, Inc., a   61%   interest in R2 Dermatology and an   80%   interest in BeneVir. The results of each of these entities are consolidated with the Company s results from and after their respective acquisition dates based on guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 810,  Consolidation  ( ASC 810 ). The remaining interests not owned by the Company are presented as a noncontrolling interest component of total equity. DBM Global uses a 4-4-5 week quarterly cycle, which for the   third   quarter of   2016   ended on October 1, 2016.  
    
  Reclassification    
    
   Certain previous year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentations related to the reporting of new financial statement line items. 
    
  Adjustments 
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company identified an immaterial error in its calculation of depreciation expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 and the three months ended March 31, 2016 related to purchase accounting associated with the acquisition of DBM Global in May of 2014.  This resulted in an excess depreciation expense being recorded in each of the periods noted.  In addition, certain gains and losses on assets that were disposed of by DBM Global were incorrectly recorded during the same periods as a result of these adjustments.  The net impact of these adjustments to net income would have been an increase of   $0.7 million   and a decrease of   $0.2 million   for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and an increase of   $0.8 million   for the three months ended March 31, 2016.   
    
  The Company determined to correct the cumulative effect of these adjustments in the second quarter of 2016, which resulted in a net adjustment to net income (loss) attributable to common and participating preferred stockholders for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of   $1.3 million  .  Excluding this adjustment, net loss attributable to common and participating preferred stockholders would have been   $39.4 million   or   $1.10   per fully diluted share for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , instead of the   $38.1 million   recorded. 
    
  Newly Adopted Accounting Principles 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-16,  Business Combination Topic No. 805: Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement - Period Adjustments , which requires adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  
  
   10 

    HC2 HOLDINGS, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

This includes any effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this update, which did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,  Interest - Imputation of Interest Subtopic No. 835-30: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,  which codifies an SEC staff announcement that entities are permitted to defer and present debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as assets, rather than as a direct offset to the liability as is required now under ASU 2015-03. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this update, which did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-12, "(Part I) Fully Benefit-Responsive Investment Contracts, (Part II) Plan Investment Disclosures, and (Part III) Measurement Date Practical Expedient". Part I of this ASU is related to one area of several potential simplifications for employee benefit plans and designates contract value as the only required measure for fully benefit-responsive investment contracts, which maintains the relevant information while reducing the cost and complexity of reporting for fully benefit responsive investment contracts. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this update, which did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB has issued ASU 2015-9, "Disclosures About Short-Duration Contracts". This ASU requires insurance entities to disclose for annual reporting periods certain information in respect of liability for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this update, which did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-8,  Business Combinations Topic No. 805: Pushdown Accounting-Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 115 (SEC Update),  which rescinds certain SEC guidance in order to conform with ASU 2014-17,  Pushdown Accounting  ( ASU 2014-17 ). ASU 2014-17 was issued in November 2014 and provides a reporting entity that is a business or nonprofit activity (an  acquiree ) the option to apply pushdown accounting to its separate financial statements when an acquirer obtains control of the acquiree. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this update, which did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07, "Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent)". The amendments in this ASU remove the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The amendments also remove the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Rather, those disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure the fair value using that practical expedient. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this update, which did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-2,  Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , which amends the consolidation requirements in ASC 810 and significantly changes the consolidation analysis required under U.S. GAAP relating to whether or not to consolidate certain legal entities. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this update, which did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-1,  Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items , which eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of an extraordinary item. Under the ASU, an entity will no longer (1) segregate an extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations; (2) separately present an extraordinary item on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations; or (3) disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share data applicable to an extraordinary item. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this update, which did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force)" ("ASU 2016-15"). The amendments in ASU 2016-15 address eight specific cash flow issues and apply to all entities that are required to present a statement of cash flows under FASB ASC 230, "Statement of Cash Flows." The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption during an interim period. The Company

    HC2 HOLDINGS, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses" (Topic 326)" ("ASU-2016-13"), which amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available for sale debt securities. For assets held at amortized cost basis, ASU 2016-13 eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold in current U.S. GAAP and, instead, requires an entity to reflect its current estimate of all expected credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial assets to present the net amount expected to be collected. For available-for-sale debt securities, credit losses should be measured in a manner similar to current U.S. GAAP, however ASU 2016-13 will require that credit losses be presented as an allowance rather than as a write-down. For public business entities that file reports with the SEC, the amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-13 on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue From Contracts With Customers" "(Topic 606)" ("ASU 2016-12"), which addresses narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability, non-cash consideration, and completed contracts at transition. Additionally, the amendments in this update provide a practical expedient for contract modifications at transition and an accounting policy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for ASU 2016-12 (and any other Topic amended by ASU 2014-09). "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Section A - Summary and Amendments that Create Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers (Subtopic 340-40)" ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-12 on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, "Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing" ("ASU 2016-10"), which clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in the new revenue recognition standard. Further, this update includes targeted improvements based on input the Board received from the Transition Resource Group for Revenue Recognition and other stakeholders. ASU 2016-10seeks to proactively address areas in which diversity in practice potentially could arise, as well as to reduce the cost and complexity of applying certain aspects of the guidance both at implementation and on an ongoing basis. The Company has not yet adopted ASU 2016-10 and is currently evaluating the impact the update would have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" "(Topic 718)" ("ASU 2016-09"), which introduces targeted amendments intended to simplify accounting for stock compensation. Specifically, ASU 2016-09 requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the update would have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, "Principal versus Agent Considerations" (Topic 606), which updates the new revenue standard by clarifying the principal versus agent implementation guidance.

The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-08 on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07, "Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting" "(Topic 323)" ("ASU 2016-07"), which requires an investor to initially apply the equity method of accounting from the date such investor qualifies for that method (i.e., the date such investor obtains significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an investee). The ASU eliminates the previous requirement to retroactively adjust the investment and record a cumulative catch up for the periods that the investment had been held, but did not qualify for the equity method of accounting. Early adoption is permitted. The Company's effective date for adoption is January 1, 2017. The Company has not yet adopted this update and is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-07 on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-06, "Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments" "(Topic 815)" ("ASU 2016-06"), which addresses how an entity should assess whether contingent call or put options that can accelerate the payment of debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. This assessment is necessary to determine if the option(s) must be separately accounted for as a derivative. ASU 2016-06 clarifies that an entity is required to assess the embedded call or put options in accordance with a specific four-step decision sequence. This means that entities are not also required to assess whether the contingency for exercising the option(s) is indexed to interest rates or credit risk. For example, when evaluating debt instruments that may be put upon a change in control, the event triggering the change in control is not relevant to the assessment. Only the resulting settlement of debt is subject to the four-step decision sequence. Early adoption is permitted. The Company's effective date for adoption is January 1, 2017. The Company has not yet adopted ASU 2016-06 and is currently evaluating the impact the update would have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases" "(Topic 842)" ("ASU 2016-02"), which applies a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record, for all leases with a lease term of more than 12 months, an asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a liability to make lease payments. ASU 2016-02 requires a lessor to classify leases as either sales-type, direct financing or operating, similar to existing U.S. GAAP requirements. Classification depends on the same five criteria used by lessees as well as certain additional factors. The new standard addresses other considerations including identification of a lease, separating lease and nonlease components of a contract, sale and leaseback transactions, modifications, combining contracts, reassessment of the lease term, and remeasurement of lease payments. Early adoption is permitted.  The Company s effective date for adoption is January 1, 2019. The Company has not yet adopted ASU 2016-02 and is currently evaluating the impact the update would have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, "Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities" "(Subtopic 825-10)" ("ASU 2016-01") which, among other things, requires all equity securities currently classified as  available for sale  to be reported at fair value, with holding gains and losses recognized in net income instead of accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI"). Certain provisions of ASU 2016-01 are eligible for early adoption.  The Company s effective date for adoption is January 1, 2018. The Company has not yet adopted ASU 2016-01 and is currently evaluating the impact the update would have on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.    

3. Business Combinations    
    
  The Company s acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, that assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recognized at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Estimates of fair value included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in conformity with ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , represent the Company s best estimates and valuations developed, when needed, with the assistance of independent appraisers or, where such valuations have not yet been completed or are not available, industry data and trends and by reference to relevant market rates and transactions. The following estimates and assumptions are inherently subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies beyond the control of the Company. Accordingly, the Company cannot provide assurance that the estimates, assumptions, and values reflected in the valuations will be realized, and actual results could vary materially. 
    
  Any changes to the initial estimates of the fair value of the assets and liabilities will be recorded as adjustments to those assets and liabilities, and residual amounts will be allocated to goodwill. In accordance with ASC 805  Business Combinations,  if additional information is obtained about the initial estimates of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period (not to exceed   one year   from the date of acquisition), including finalization of asset appraisals, the Company will refine its estimates of fair value to allocate the purchase price more accurately.  
    
  Insurance Segment 
    
  On December 24, 2015, the Company completed the acquisitions of   100%   of the interest in each of the Insurance Companies as well as all assets owned by the sellers of the Insurance Companies and their affiliates (the "Seller Parties") that are used exclusively or primarily in the business of the Insurance Companies, subject to certain exceptions. The operations of the Insurance Companies form the basis of our Insurance segment, and we plan to leverage their existing platform and industry expertise to identify strategic growth opportunities for managing closed blocks of long-term care businesses.

The aggregate consideration paid in connection with the acquisition of the Insurance Companies and related transactions and agreements was valued at   $18.7 million  , consisting of   $7.1 million   of cash,   $2.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of the Company s   11.0%   Senior Secured Notes due 2019,   1,007,422   shares of the Company's common stock and   five  -year warrants to purchase   2,000,000   shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of   $7.08   per share (subject to customary adjustments for stock splits or similar transactions) exercisable on or after February 3, 2016 (the "Warrants"). 
    
  Purchase Price Allocation 
    
  The preliminary fair values of identified assets acquired, liabilities assumed, residual goodwill and consideration transferred are summarized as follows (in thousands):  

The values of intangibles, life, accident and health reserves, annuity reserves, and value of business acquired are estimates and might change.  
    
  The acquisition of the Insurance Companies resulted in the recording of goodwill of approximately   $46.6 million  . Goodwill consists of the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired that could not be individually identified and separately recognized. The Insurance Companies were recognized as a new stand-alone reporting unit. Goodwill is not amortized and is not deductible for tax purposes. 
    
  The Value of Business Acquired ("VOBA") 
    
  The VOBA was derived using a  Becker-ized  Present Value of Distributable Earnings ( PVDE ) method. The PVDE was derived using the statutory after tax profits. The VOBA was valued at   $51.6 million   and is amortized over the anticipated remaining

future lifetime of the acquired long-term care blocks of business.  VOBA is amortized in relation to the projected future premium of the acquired long-term care blocks of business. 
    
  Recoverable from Reinsurers 
    
  The recoverable from reinsurers balance represents amounts recoverable from third parties. U.S. GAAP requires insurance reserves and recoverable from reinsurers balances to be presented on a gross basis, as opposed to U.S. statutory accounting principles, where reserves are presented net of reinsurance. Accordingly, the Company grossed up the fair value of the net insurance contract liability for the amount of reinsurance of approximately   $515.9 million  , to arrive at a gross insurance liability, and recognized an offsetting recoverable from reinsurers amount of approximately   $515.9 million  . As part of this process, management analyzed reinsurance counterparty credit risk and considers it to have an immaterial impact on the reinsurance fair value gross-up. To mitigate this risk substantially all reinsurance is ceded to companies with investment grade S P ratings. 
       
  Amounts recoverable from reinsurers were estimated in a manner consistent with the liability associated with the reinsured policies and were an estimate of the recoverable from reinsurers amount in respect of each of paid and unpaid losses, including an estimate for losses incurred but not reported. Recoverable from reinsurers represents expected cash inflows from reinsurers for liabilities ceded and therefore incorporate uncertainties as to the timing and amount of claim payments. Recoverable from reinsurers includes the balances due from reinsurers under the terms of the reinsurance agreements for these ceded balances as well as settlement amounts currently due. 
    
  Contingent Liability  
    
  Pursuant to the agreements governing the acquisition of the Insurance Companies, the Company also agreed to pay to the Seller Parties, on an annual basis with respect to the years 2015 through 2019, the amount, if any, by which the Insurance Companies  cash flow testing and premium deficiency reserves decrease from the amount of such reserves as of December 31, 2014. Such payments are capped at   $13.0 million   in the aggregate. The balance is calculated based on the fluctuation of the statutory cash flow testing and premium deficiency reserves annually following each of the Insurance Companies' filing with its applicable insurance regulator of its annual statutory financial statements for each calendar year ending December 31 through and including December 31, 2019. Based on the 2015 statutory statements, the Company does not have a payment due. Further, the Company's current estimate is that the obligation will not be incurred through the calendar year ending December 31, 2019. This expectation is primarily driven by the following factors: (i) reduced confidence that treasury rates will increase to historical averages over the near term; (ii) uncertainty around future operating expenses historically performed by the Seller Parties; and (iii) the increase in the premium deficiency reserve as reported at December 31, 2015 of approximately   $8.0 million   (because the balance is cumulative over the period, a decrease of approximately   $8.0 million   would be required before there would be any obligation to the Seller Parties under the earn-out). The Company will perform this assessment at each reporting period through December 31, 2019 or until the   $13.0 million   is paid in full. 
    
  Control Level Risk-Based Capital 
    
  In connection with the consummation of the acquisition of the Insurance Companies, the Company agreed with the statutory regulator of CGI, the Ohio Department of Insurance ("ODOI"), that for   five   years following the closing of the transaction, the Company will contribute to CGI cash or marketable securities acceptable to the ODOI to the extent required for CGI s total adjusted capital to be not less than   400%   of CGI s authorized control level risk-based capital (each as defined under Ohio law and reported in CGI s statutory statements filed with the ODOI). Similarly, the Company has agreed with the statutory regulator of UTA, the Texas Department of Insurance ("TDOI"), that, for   five   years following the closing of the transaction, the Company will contribute to UTA cash or other admitted assets acceptable to the TDOI to the extent required for UTA s total adjusted capital to be not less than   400%   of UTA s authorized control level risk-based capital (each as defined under Texas law and reported in UTA s statutory statements filed with the TDOI).  
    
  In connection with the consummation of the acquisition of the Insurance Companies, each of the Insurance Companies also entered into a capital maintenance agreement with Great American Financial Resources, Inc. ("GAFRI" and each such agreement, a  Capital Maintenance Agreement,  and collectively, the  Capital Maintenance Agreements ). Under each Capital Maintenance Agreement, if the applicable Insurance Company's total adjusted capital reported in its annual statutory financial statements is less than   400%   of its authorized control level risk-based capital, GAFRI will pay cash or assets to the applicable Insurance Company, as required, to eliminate such shortfall (after giving effect to any capital contributions made by the Company or its affiliates since the date of the relevant annual statutory financial statements). GAFRI s obligation to make such payments is capped at   $25.0

Each of the Capital Maintenance Agreements will remain in effect from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2021, or until payments by GAFRI thereunder equal the maximum amount payable under the applicable agreement. The Company will indemnify GAFRI for the amount of any payments made by it under the Capital Maintenance Agreements.  
    
  Other 
    
  Transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Insurance Companies were   $0.0   and   $0.5 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and were included within Selling, general and administrative expenses. The Company recorded net revenue of   $34.5 million   and   $99.8 million   and net loss of   $2.0 million   and   $12.6 million   from the Insurance Companies for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

Other Acquisitions 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased   three   fueling stations, completed the acquisition of additional interests in and thereby control of NerVve and BeneVir, and acquired a   60%   controlling interest in CWind Limited ("CWind") with an obligation to purchase the remaining   40%   in equal amounts on September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017 (based on agreed financial targets). The total consideration transferred for these acquisitions was   $21.9 million   including   $13.7 million   in cash. The results of each of the companies acquired have been reported in our results of operations from the date of acquisition. 
    
  We have preliminarily allocated the purchase price of these acquired businesses to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. We are in the process of completing the valuation of identifiable intangible assets, fixed assets and debt; therefore, the fair values set forth below are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the valuations. The amounts in respect of these potential adjustments could be significant. We expect to complete the purchase price allocation for fiscal year 2016 acquisitions during fiscal year 2017.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments - Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities 
    
  A portion of certain other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) losses on fixed maturity securities is recognized in AOCI. For these securities the net amount recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations ( credit loss impairments ) represents the difference between the amortized cost of the securities and the net present value of their projected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in such securities prior to impairment. Any remaining difference between the fair value and amortized cost is recognized in AOCI. The Company recorded a   $1.5 million   and   $2.6 million   impairment related to   two   fixed maturity securities for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company reported a   $2.5 million   impairment within   Other income (expense), net   and a   $0.2 million   impairment within   Net realized losses on investments  . The Company did not record any impairments on fixed maturity or equity securities during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Unrealized Losses for Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities Available-for-Sale  
    
  The following table presents the total unrealized losses for the   117   and   528   fixed maturity and equity securities held by the  Company as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below amortized cost by the indicated amount (in thousands): 

The determination of whether unrealized losses are  other-than-temporary  requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors. Factors considered and resources used by management include (i) whether the unrealized loss is credit-driven or a result of changes in market interest rates, (ii) the extent to which fair value is less than cost basis, (iii) cash flow projections received from independent sources, (iv) historical operating, balance sheet and cash flow data contained in issuer SEC filings and news releases, (v) near-term prospects for improvement in the issuer and/or its industry, (vi) third party research and communications with industry specialists, (vii) financial models and forecasts, (viii) the continuity of dividend payments, maintenance of investment grade ratings and hybrid nature of certain investments, (ix) discussions with issuer management, and (x) ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value. 
    
  The Company analyzes its MBS for other-than-temporary impairment each quarter based upon expected future cash flows. Management estimates expected future cash flows based upon its knowledge of the MBS market, cash flow projections (which reflect loan-to-collateral values, subordination, vintage and geographic concentration) received from independent sources, implied cash flows inherent in security ratings and analysis of historical payment data.  
    
  The Company believes it will recover its cost basis in the non-impaired securities with unrealized losses and that the Company has the ability to hold the securities until they recover in value. The Company neither intends to sell nor does it expect to be required to sell the securities with unrealized losses as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. However, unforeseen

facts and circumstances may cause the Company to sell fixed maturity and equity securities in the ordinary course of managing its portfolio to meet certain diversification, credit quality and liquidity guidelines. 
    
  The following tables present the estimated fair values and gross unrealized losses for the   117   and   528   fixed maturity and equity securities held by the Company that have estimated fair values below amortized cost as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company does not have any OTTI losses reported in AOCI. These investments are presented by investment category and the length of time the related fair value has remained below amortized cost (in thousands): 

At   September 30, 2016  , investment grade fixed maturity securities (as determined by nationally recognized rating agencies) represented approximately   13.0%   of the gross unrealized loss and   52.5%   of the fair value. At   December 31, 2015  , investment grade fixed maturity securities represented approximately   33.2%   of the gross unrealized loss and   88.3%   of the fair value.  
    
  Certain risks are inherent in connection with fixed maturity securities, including loss upon default, price volatility in reaction to changes in interest rates, and general market factors and risks associated with reinvestment of proceeds due to prepayments or redemptions in a period of declining interest rates.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

The Company reviews the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period. Changes in the observability of the valuation attributes may result in a reclassification of certain financial assets or liabilities. Such reclassifications are reported as transfers in and out of Level 3, or between other levels, at the beginning fair value for the reporting period in which the changes occur. The Company transferred   $1.1 million   corporate and other bonds and   $0.5 million   preferred stock from Level 1 into Level 2 during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , reflecting the level of market activity in these instruments. There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Availability of secondary market activity and consistency of pricing from third-party sources impacts the Company's ability to classify securities as Level 2 or Level 3. The Company s assessment resulted in a net transfer out of Level 3 of   $0.6 million   and transfer into Level 3 of   $2.4 million   during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The methods and assumptions the Company uses to estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized below: 
    
  Fixed Maturity Securities -   The fair values of the Company s publicly-traded fixed maturity securities are generally based on prices obtained from independent pricing services. Prices from pricing services are sourced from multiple vendors, and a vendor hierarchy is maintained by asset type based on historical pricing experience and vendor expertise. In some cases, the Company receives prices from multiple pricing services for each security, but ultimately uses the price from the pricing service highest in the vendor hierarchy based on the respective asset type. Consistent with the fair value hierarchy described above, securities with validated quotes from pricing services are generally reflected within Level 2, as they are primarily based on observable pricing for similar assets and/or other market observable inputs.  
    
  If the Company ultimately concludes that pricing information received from the independent pricing service is not reflective of market activity, non-binding broker quotes are used, if available. If the Company concludes the values from both pricing services and brokers are not reflective of market activity, it may override the information from the pricing service or broker with an internally developed valuation; however, this occurs infrequently. Internally developed valuations or non-binding broker quotes are also used to determine fair value in circumstances where vendor pricing is not available. These estimates may use significant unobservable inputs, which reflect the Company s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing the asset. Pricing service overrides, internally developed valuations and non-binding broker quotes are generally based on significant unobservable inputs and are reflected as Level 3 in the valuation hierarchy. 
    
  The inputs used in the valuation of corporate and government securities include, but are not limited to, standard market observable inputs which are derived from, or corroborated by, market observable data including market yield curve, duration, call provisions, observable prices and spreads for similar publicly traded or privately traded issues that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer.  

23 

    HC2 HOLDINGS, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

For structured securities, valuation is based primarily on matrix pricing or other similar techniques using standard market inputs including spreads for actively traded securities, spreads off benchmark yields, expected prepayment speeds and volumes, current and forecasted loss severity, rating, weighted average coupon, weighted average maturity, average delinquency rates, geographic region, debt-service coverage ratios and issuance-specific information including, but not limited to: collateral type, payment terms of the underlying assets, payment priority within the tranche, structure of the security, deal performance and vintage of loans. 
    
  When observable inputs are not available, the market standard valuation techniques for determining the estimated fair value of certain types of securities that trade infrequently, and therefore have little or no price transparency, rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value but that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable inputs are sometimes based in large part on management judgment or estimation, and cannot be supported by reference to market activity. Even though unobservable, these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and are believed to be consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities. 
    
  The fair values of private placement securities are primarily determined using a discounted cash flow model. In certain cases these models primarily use observable inputs with a discount rate based upon the average of spread surveys collected from private market intermediaries who are active in both primary and secondary transactions, taking into account, among other factors, the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer and the reduced liquidity associated with private placements. Generally, these securities have been reflected within Level 3. For certain private fixed maturities, the discounted cash flow model may also incorporate significant unobservable inputs, which reflect the Company s own assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the security. To the extent management determines that such unobservable inputs are not significant to the price of a security, a Level 2 classification is made. Otherwise, a Level 3 classification is used. 
    
  Equity Securities.   The balance consists principally of common and preferred stock of publicly and privately traded companies. The fair values of publicly traded equity securities are primarily based on quoted market prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair values of preferred equity securities, for which quoted market prices are not readily available, are based on prices obtained from independent pricing services and these securities are generally classified within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of common stock of privately held companies was determined using unobservable market inputs, including volatility and underlying security values and was classified as Level 3. 
    
  Cash Equivalents.   The balance consists of money market instruments, which are generally valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible for identical assets and are primarily classified as Level 1. Various time deposits carried as cash equivalents are not measured at estimated fair value and therefore are excluded from the tables presented. 
    
  Derivatives.   The balance consists of common stock purchase warrants and call options. The fair values of the call options are primarily based on quoted market prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. Depending on the terms, the common stock warrants were valued using either Black-Scholes analysis or Monte Carlo Simulation. Fair value was determined using unobservable market inputs, including volatility and underlying security values, therefore the common stock purchase warrants were classified as Level 3. 
    
  Warrant Liability.   The balance consists of the Warrants issued in connection with the acquisition of the Insurance Companies and recorded within other liabilities on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value was determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation because the adjustments for exercise price and warrant shares represent path dependent features; the exercise price from prior periods needs to be known to determine whether a subsequent sale of shares occurs at a price that is lower than the then current exercise price. The analysis entails a Geometric Brownian Motion based simulation of 100 unique price paths of the Company's stock for each combination of assumptions. Fair value was determined using unobservable market inputs, including volatility, and a range of assumptions regarding a possibility of an equity capital raise each year and the expected size of future equity capital raises. The present value of a given simulated scenario was based on intrinsic value at expiration discounted to the valuation date, taking into account any adjustments to the exercise price or warrant shares issuable. The average present value across all 100 independent price paths represents the estimate of fair value for each combination of assumptions. Therefore, the warrant liability was classified as Level 3.

Since internally developed Level 3 asset fair values represent less than   1%   of the Company s total assets, any justifiable changes in unobservable inputs used to determine internally developed fair values would not have a material impact on the Company s financial position. 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value 
       
  The Company is required by general accounting principles for   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   to disclose the fair value of certain financial instruments including those that are not carried at fair value. The following table presents the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments, which were not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash, accounts receivable, costs and recognized earnings in excess of billings, accounts payable, accrued expenses, billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings, and other current assets and liabilities approximate fair value due to relatively short periods to maturity (in thousands): 

(1) Excludes life contingent annuities in the payout phase. 
  (2) Excludes certain lease obligations accounted for under ASC 840, "Leases". 
    
  Mortgage Loans on Real Estate.   The fair value of mortgage loans on real estate is estimated by discounting cash flows, both principal and interest, using current interest rates for mortgage loans with similar credit ratings and similar remaining maturities. As such, inputs include current treasury yields and spreads, which are based on the credit rating and average life of the loan, corresponding to the market spreads. The valuation of mortgage loans on real estate is considered Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Policy Loans.   The policy loans are reported at the unpaid principal balance and carry a fixed interest rate. The Company determined that the carrying value approximates fair value because (i) policy loans present no credit risk as the amount of the loan cannot exceed the obligation due upon the death of the insured or surrender of the underlying policy; (ii) there is no active market for policy loans (i.e., there is no commonly available exit price to determine the fair value of policy loans in the open market); (iii) policy loans are intricately linked to the underlying policy liability and, in many cases, policy loan balances are recovered through offsetting the loan balance against the benefits paid under the policy; and (iv) policy loans can be repaid by policyholders at any time, and this prepayment uncertainty reduces the potential impact of a difference between amortized cost (carrying value) and fair value. The valuation of policy loans is considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 
    
  Other Invested Assets.   The balance primarily includes common stock purchase warrants. The fair values were derived using Black-Scholes analysis using unobservable market inputs, including volatility and underlying security values; therefore, the common stock purchase warrants were classified as Level 3. 
    
  Annuity Benefits Accumulated.   The fair value of annuity benefits was determined using the surrender values of the annuities and classified as Level 3. 
    
  Long-term Obligations.   The fair value of the Company s long-term obligations was determined using Bloomberg Valuation Service BVAL. The methodology combines direct market observations from contributed sources with quantitative pricing models to generate evaluated prices and classified as Level 2.

resulted in a discount of   $2.4 million  . The net proceeds from the issuance of the November 2014 Notes were used to repay a senior secured credit facility, which had provided for a   twelve   month, floating interest rate term loan of   $214 million   and a delayed draw term loan of   $36 million  , entered into in connection with the Company's acquisition of GMSL. On March 26, 2015, the Company issued an additional   $50.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   11.0%   Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the  March 2015 Notes ). The March 2015 Notes were issued at a price of   100.5%   of principal amount, plus accrued interest from November 20, 2014, which resulted in a premium of   $0.3 million  . On August 5, 2015, the Company issued an additional   $5.0 million   aggregate principal amount of its   11.0%   Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the  August 2015 Notes ). The August 2015 Notes were issued in consideration for a release of claims by holders of the Preferred Stock discussed below (see Note 17 - Equity for additional information). On December 24, 2015, the Company issued an additional   $2.0 million   aggregate principal amount of its   11%   Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (the "December 2015 Notes").  All of the   11.0%   Senior Secured Notes due 2019 (collectively, the "  11.0%   Notes") were issued under an indenture dated November 20, 2014, by and among HC2, the guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank National Association, a national banking association ( U.S. Bank ), as trustee (the    11.0%   Notes Indenture ). 
    
  Maturity and Interest  . The   11.0%   Notes mature on   December 1, 2019  . The   11.0%   Notes accrue interest at a rate of   11.0%   per year.   Interest on the 11.0% Notes is paid semi-annually on December 1st and June 1st of each year.    
    
  Ranking  . The   11.0%   Notes and the guarantees thereof are HC2 s and certain of its direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries  (the  Subsidiary Guarantors ) general senior secured obligations. The   11.0%   Notes and the guarantees thereof rank: (i) senior in right of payment to all of HC2 s and the Subsidiary Guarantors  future subordinated debt; (ii) equal in right of payment with all of HC2 s and the Subsidiary Guarantors  existing and future senior debt and effectively senior to all of the Company's unsecured debt to the extent of the value of the collateral; and (iii) effectively subordinated to all liabilities of its non-guarantor subsidiaries. 
    
  Collateral.   The   11.0%   Notes and the guarantees thereof are collateralized on a first-priority basis by substantially all of HC2 s assets and the assets of the Subsidiary Guarantors (except for certain  Excluded Assets,  and subject to certain  Permitted Liens,  each as defined in the   11.0%   Notes Indenture). The   11.0%   Notes Indenture permits the Company, under specified circumstances, to incur additional debt that could equally and ratably share in the collateral. The amount of such debt is limited by the covenants contained in the   11.0%   Notes Indenture. 
    
  Certain Covenants  . The   11.0%   Notes Indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, the ability of HC2 and, in certain cases, HC2 s subsidiaries, to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain types of redeemable equity interests; create liens; engage in sale-leaseback transactions; pay dividends; make distributions in respect of capital stock and make certain other restricted payments; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; or consolidate or merge with, or sell substantially all of its assets to, another person. These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. HC2 is also required to maintain compliance with certain financial tests, including minimum liquidity and collateral coverage ratios. As of   September 30, 2016  , HC2 was in compliance with these covenants. 
    
  Redemption Premiums  . The Company may redeem the   11.0%   Notes at a redemption price equal to   100.0%   of the principal amount of the   11.0%   Notes plus a make-whole premium if the 11.0% Notes are redeemed before   December 1, 2016  . The make-whole premium is the greater of (i)   1%   of principal amount or (ii) the excess of the present value of the redemption price at December 1, 2016 plus all required interest payments through December 1, 2016 over the principal amount. On or after December 1, 2016 and until November 30, 2017, the Company may redeem the   11.0%   Notes at a redemption price equal to   108.25%   and on or after December 1, 2017 until November 30, 2018 at a redemption price equal to   105.50%   of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest.

13. Income Taxes    
    
  Income Tax Benefit 
          
  Income tax was a   benefit   of   $1.3 million   and an   expense   of   $1.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and a   benefit   of   $3.6 million   and a   benefit   of   $1.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
    
  The Company used the Annual Effective Tax Rate ( ETR ) approach of ASC 740-270 (formerly FIN 18), "Interim Reporting," to calculate its 2016 interim tax provision.  
    
  NOL Limitation 
    
  The Company has an estimated NOL carryforward for U.S. federal tax purposes in the amount of   $80.7 million  . In the first quarter of   2014  , substantial acquisitions of the Company's stock were reported by new beneficial owners of   5.0%   or more of the Company s common stock on Schedule 13D filings made with the SEC. On May 29, 2014, the Company issued   30,000   shares of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock of the Company (the  Series A Preferred Stock ) and   1,500,000   shares of common stock to finance the acquisition of DBM Global. During the second quarter of 2014 the Company completed a Section 382 review. The conclusions of this review indicate that an ownership change had occurred as of May 29, 2014. The Company s annual Section 382 base limit following the ownership change is estimated to be   $2.3 million   per year. On November 4, 2015, HC2 issued   8,452,500   shares of its stock in a primary offering which the Company believes resulted in a Section 382 ownership change resulting in an additional annual limitation to cumulative carryforward. NOLs of approximately   $77.7 million   are subject to this new limitation. The Company does not believe that any NOLs will expire as a result of the November 2015 ownership change.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits 
    
  The Company follows the provision of ASC 740-10,  Income Taxes , which prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the Company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The Company is subject to challenge from various taxing authorities relative to certain tax planning strategies, including certain intercompany transactions as well as regulatory taxes. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits may change in the next   12 months  ; however, the Company does not expect any such change to have a significant impact on the results of operations or the financial position of the Company. 
    
  Examinations 
    
  The Company conducts business globally, and as a result, the Company or one or more of its subsidiaries files income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course of business the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. The open tax years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the applicability of income tax credits for the relevant tax period. Given the nature of tax audits there is a risk that disputes may arise. Tax years   2002   -   2015   remain open for examination. 

14. Commitments and Contingencies    
    
  Litigation    
    
  The Company is subject to claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that the outcome of any such matter will be decided favorably to the Company or that the resolution of any such matter will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company does not believe that any of such pending claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company records a liability in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in a liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary for the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements not to be misleading. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  On July 16, 2013, Plaintiffs Xplornet Communications Inc. and Xplornet Broadband, Inc. ( Xplornet ) initiated an action against Inukshuk Wireless Inc. ( Inukshuk ), Globility Communications Corporation ( Globility ), MIPPS Inc., Primus Telecommunications Canada Inc. ("PTCI") and Primus Telecommunications Group, Incorporated (n/k/a HC2).  Xplornet alleges that it entered into an agreement to acquire certain licenses for radio spectrum in Canada from Globility but that Globility breached the letter of intent by selling the licenses to Inukshuk. Xplornet also alleges similar claims against Inukshuk, and seeks damages from all defendants in the amount of   $50 million  .  On January 29, 2014, Globility, MIPPS Inc., and PTCI, demanded indemnification pursuant to the Equity Purchase Agreement among PTUS, Inc., PTCAN, Inc., the Company (f/k/a Primus Telecommunications Group, Incorporated), Primus Telecommunications Holding, Inc., Lingo Holdings, Inc., and Primus Telecommunications International, Inc., dated as of May 10, 2013.  On February 14, 2014, the Company assumed the defense of this litigation, while reserving all of its rights under the Equity Purchase Agreement. Inukshuk filed a cross claim against Globility, MIPPS, PTCI, and the Company.  Inukshuk asserts that if Inukshuk is found liable to Xplornet, then Inukshuk is entitled to contribution and indemnity, compensatory damages, interest, and costs from the Company. The Company and Inukshuk have moved for summary judgment against Xplornet, arguing that there was no agreement between Globility and Xplornet to acquire the licenses at issue.  
    
  On January 19, 2016, PTCI sought and obtained an order under the Companies  Creditors Arrangement Act (the  CCAA ) from the Ontario Superior Court of Justice. PTCI received an Initial Order staying all proceedings against PTCI until February 26, 2016 - which it has moved to extend through September 2016. On February 25, 2016, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice extended the stay of proceedings until September 19, 2016. PTCI has advised the Company that this stays all proceedings against PTCI, Globility, and MIPPS, except against the Company. 
    
  In October 2016, the Company settled the matter. On November 8, 2016, the Court entered a consent order dismissing this action.

On November 6, 2014, a putative stockholder class action complaint challenging the tender offer by which HC2 acquired approximately   721,000   of the issued and outstanding common shares of DBM Global was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned   Mark Jacobs v. Philip A. Falcone, Keith M. Hladek, Paul Voigt, Michael R. Hill, Rustin Roach, D. Ronald Yagoda, Phillip O. Elbert, HC2 Holdings, Inc., and Schuff International, Inc.  , Civil Action No. 10323 (the  Complaint ).  On November 17, 2014, a second lawsuit was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned   Arlen Diercks v. Schuff International, Inc. Philip A. Falcone, Keith M. Hladek, Paul Voigt, Michael R. Hill, Rustin Roach, D. Ronald Yagoda, Phillip O. Elbert, HC2 Holdings, Inc.  , Civil Action No. 10359.  On February 19, 2015, the court consolidated the actions (now designated as Schuff International, Inc. Stockholders Litigation) and appointed lead plaintiff and counsel.  The currently operative complaint is the Complaint filed by Mark Jacobs. The Complaint alleges, among other things, that in connection with the tender offer, the individual members of the DBM Global's Board of Directors and HC2, the now-controlling stockholder of DBM Global, breached their fiduciary duties to members of the plaintiff class. The Complaint also purports to challenge a potential short-form merger based upon plaintiff s expectation that the Company would cash out the remaining public stockholders of DBM Global following the completion of the tender offer.  The Complaint seeks rescission of the tender offer and/or compensatory damages, as well as attorney s fees and other relief. The defendants filed answers to the Complaint on July 30, 2015.  The litigation is currently in the discovery phase, and fact discovery is scheduled to be completed on March 27, 2017.  Trial is scheduled for March 12-15, 2018.  We believe that the allegations and claims set forth in the Complaint are without merit and intend to defend our interests vigorously. 
    
  Tax Matters 
    
  Currently, the Canada Revenue Agency ( CRA ) is auditing a subsidiary previously held by the Company. The Company intends to cooperate in audit matters. To date, CRA has not proposed any specific adjustments and the audit is ongoing.  

15. Employee Retirement Plans    
    
  The following table presents the components of net periodic benefit cost for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively (in thousands): 

The Company previously disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   that it expected to contribute   $7.2 million   to its pension plans in   2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $1.4 million   contributions have been made. Due to current funding levels, the Company does not anticipate contributing further funds to its pension plans in   2016  .  

16. Share-Based Compensation    
    
  On April 11, 2014, HC2 s board of directors adopted the HC2 Holdings, Inc. 2014 Omnibus Equity Award Plan (the  Omnibus Plan ), which was approved by our stockholders at the annual meeting of stockholders held on June 12, 2014. The Omnibus Plan provides that no further awards will be granted pursuant to the Company s Management Compensation Plan, as amended (the  Prior Plan ). However, awards that had been previously granted pursuant to the Prior Plan will continue to be subject to and governed by the terms of the Prior Plan.  
    
  The Compensation Committee of HC2's board of directors administers HC2's Omnibus Plan and the Prior Plan and has broad authority to administer, construe and interpret the plans. 
    
  The Omnibus Plan provides for the grant of awards of non-qualified stock options, incentive (qualified) stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, other stock based awards, performance compensation awards (including cash bonus awards) or any combination of the foregoing. The Company typically issues new shares of common stock  
  
   35 

    HC2 HOLDINGS, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

upon the exercise of stock options, as opposed to using treasury shares. The Omnibus Plan authorizes the issuance of up to   5,000,000   shares of the Company s common stock, subject to adjustment as provided in the Omnibus Plan. 
    
  The Company follows guidance which addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions whereby an entity receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the enterprise or liabilities that are based on the fair value of the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments. The guidance generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value based method and share-based compensation expense be recorded, based on the grant date fair value, estimated in accordance with the guidance, for all new and unvested stock awards that are ultimately expected to vest as the requisite service is rendered. 
    
  The Company granted   1,506,848   and   1,406,681   options during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Of the total options granted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   6,848   and   885,173  , respectively, of such options were granted to Philip Falcone, pursuant to a standalone option agreement entered in connection with Mr. Falcone s appointment as Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and not pursuant to the Omnibus Plan. The anti-dilution protection provision contained in such standalone option agreement was canceled in April 2016 and replaced with an award consisting solely of   1,500,000   premium stock options issued under the Omnibus Plan.  The weighted average fair value at date of grant for options granted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.09   and   $1.55  , respectively, per option. The fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions shown as a weighted average for the year: 

Total share-based compensation expense recognized by the Company and its subsidiaries under all equity compensation arrangements during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $1.8 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively. Total share-based compensation expense recognized by the Company and its subsidiaries under all equity compensation arrangements during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $6.7 million   and   $7.4 million  , respectively. Most of the Company s stock awards vest ratably during the vesting period. The Company recognizes compensation expense for equity awards, reduced by estimated forfeitures, using the straight-line basis. 
    
  Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units 
    
  A summary of the Company s restricted stock and restricted stock unit activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the unvested restricted stock represented   $0.5 million   of compensation expense that is expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period of   1.1 years  . The number of shares of unvested restricted stock expected to vest is   185,189  .

17. Equity    
    
  Preferred and Common Stock 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   38,031,325   and   35,249,749   shares of common stock outstanding, respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   42,308   and   53,172   shares of the Company's Preferred Stock outstanding. 
    
  On May 29, 2014, the Company issued   30,000   shares of Series A Preferred Stock and   1,500,000   shares of common stock, the proceeds of which were used to pay for a portion of the purchase price related to the acquisition of DBM Global. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of   $4.25  . On September 22, 2014, the Company issued   11,000   shares of Series A-1 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock of the Company (the  Series A-1 Preferred Stock ). Each share of Series A-1 Preferred Stock is convertible into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of   $4.25  . On January 5, 2015, the Company issued   14,000   shares of Series A-2 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock of the Company (the "Series A-2 Preferred Stock" and together with the Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the  Preferred Stock ). Each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock is convertible into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of   $7.85  . The Company has amended the certificates of designation governing the Series A-1 Preferred Stock to reflect the issuance of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock as a class of preferred stock which ranks at parity with the Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock and to make certain other technical and administrative changes to conform the terms of the Series A-1 Preferred Stock to those of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock.  
       
  The conversion prices for the Preferred Stock are subject to adjustments for dividends, certain distributions, stock splits, combinations, reclassifications, reorganizations, mergers, recapitalizations and similar events. The Preferred Stock accrues a cumulative quarterly cash dividend at an annualized rate of   7.5%   of the accreted value thereof. In addition, the accreted value of the Preferred Stock accretes quarterly at an annualized rate of   4.0%   that will be reduced to   2.0%   or   0.0%   if the Company achieves specified rates of growth measured by increases in its net asset value. 
        
  Each share of Series A Preferred Stock may be converted by the holder into common stock at any time based on the then-applicable conversion price. On the seventh anniversary of the issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to cause the Company to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock at the accreted value per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock that is not so redeemed will be automatically converted into shares of common stock at the conversion price then in effect. Upon a change of control, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to cause the Company to redeem their Series A Preferred Stock at a price per share equal to the greater of (i) the accrued value of the Series A Preferred Stock, which amount would be multiplied by   150%   in the event of a change of control  
  
   37 

    HC2 HOLDINGS, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

occurring on or prior to the third anniversary of the issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock plus any accrued but unpaid dividends and (ii) the value that would be received if the share of Series A Preferred Stock were converted into common stock immediately prior to the change of control. 
   Certain certificates of amendment related to the Company s Series A Preferred Stock (the  Prior Amendments ) did not become effective because they were filed without proper authorization of the stockholders of the Company. The holders of the Series A Preferred Stock agreed to release all claims against the Company relating to the ineffectiveness of the Prior Amendments, including the fact that the conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock remains at   $4.25  . As payment for the release of claims, the Company issued   $5.0 million   aggregate principal amount of the   11.0%   Notes to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock. The Company recorded this payment to other income (expense), net in August 2015. 
    
   At any time after the third anniversary of the issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company may redeem the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole but not in part, at a price per share generally equal to   150%   of the accrued value per share plus accrued but unpaid dividends. After the third anniversary of the issue date of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company may force conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock into common stock if the common stock s   thirty  -day volume-weighted average price ( VWAP ) exceeds   150%   of the then-applicable conversion price and the common stock s daily VWAP exceeds   150%   of the then-applicable conversion price for at least   twenty   trading days out of the   thirty   trading day period used to calculate the   thirty  -day VWAP. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   1,864   and   9,000   shares of Series A and A-1 Preferred Stock were converted into   444,550   and   2,119,764   shares of the Company's common stock, respectively, in private exchange transactions. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  ,   1,000   shares of Series A-1 Preferred Stock were converted into   235,526   shares of common stock in private exchange transactions. We refer to these transactions as the "Preferred Share Conversions". 
    
  In their Preferred Share conversions conjunction consummated during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued   15,318   and   136,149   shares of its Common Stock (the "Conversion Share Consideration") to Corrib Master Fund, Ltd ("Corrib") and Luxor Capital Group, LLP ("Luxor"), respectively. The fair value of the Conversion Share Consideration was   $0.7 million   on the date of the issuance.  
    
  The Company also agreed to provide the following two forms of additional consideration for as long as the Preferred Stock remained entitled to receive dividend payments (the "Additional Share Consideration"). 
    
  In addition, the Company agreed that in the event that Corrib and Luxor would have been entitled to any Participating Dividends payable, had they not converted the Preferred Stock (as defined in the respective Series A and Series A-1 Certificate of Designation), after the date of their Preferred Share conversion, then the Company will issue to Corrib and Luxor, on the date such Participating Dividends become payable by the Company, in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act the number of shares of common stock equal to (a) the value of the Participating Dividends Corrib or Luxor would have received pursuant to Sections (2)(c) and (2)(d) of the respective Series A and Series A-1 Certificate of Designation, divided by (b) the Thirty Day VWAP (as defined in the respective Series A and Series A-1 Certificate of Designation) for the period ending two business days prior to the underlying event or transaction that would have entitled Corrib or Luxor to such Participating Dividend had Corrib s or Luxor s Preferred Stock remain unconverted. 
    
  Further, the Company agreed that it will issue to Corrib and Luxor, on each quarterly anniversary of May 29, 2017 (or, if later, the date on which the corresponding dividend payment is made to the holders of the outstanding Preferred Stock), through and until the Maturity Date (as defined in the respective Series A and Series A-1 Certificate of Designation), in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act the number of shares of common stock equal to (a)   1.875%   the Accrued Value (as defined in the respective Series A and Series A-1 Certificate of Designation) of Corrib s or Luxor s Preferred Stock as of the Closing Date (as defined in applicable Voluntary Conversion Agreements) divided by (b) the Thirty Day VWAP (as defined in the respective Series A and Series A-1 Certificate of Designation) for the period ending two business days prior to the applicable Dividend Payment Date (as defined in the respective Series A and Series A-1 Certificate of Designation).  
    
  The Additional Share Consideration was valued by the Company at   $1.5 million   and recorded within other liabilities.

19. Operating Segment and Related Information    
    
  The Company currently has   two   primary reportable geographic segments - United States and United Kingdom; and Other. The Company has   seven   reportable operating segments based on management s organization of the enterprise - Manufacturing, Marine Services, Insurance, Telecommunications, Utilities, Life Sciences, Other, and a non-operating Corporate segment.

20. Backlog    
    
  DBM Global s backlog was   $318.2 million  , with   $243.8 million   under contracts or purchase orders and   $74.4 million   under letters of intent at   September 30, 2016  . DBM Global s backlog increases as contract commitments, letters of intent, notices to proceed and purchase orders are obtained, decreases as revenues are recognized, and increases or decreases to reflect modifications in the work to be performed under the contracts, notices to proceed, letters of intent or purchase orders. DBM Global s backlog can be significantly affected by the receipt and loss of individual contracts. Approximately   $159.8 million  , representing   50.2%   of DBM Global s backlog at   September 30, 2016  , was attributable to   five   contracts, letters of intent, notices to proceed or purchase orders. If one or more of these large contracts or other commitments were terminated or their scope reduced, DBM Global s backlog could decrease substantially. 

21. Basic and Diluted Loss Per Common Share    
    
  Earnings per share ("EPS") is calculated using the two class method, which allocates earnings among common stock and participating securities to calculate EPS when an entity's capital structure includes either two or more classes of common stock or common stock and participating securities. Unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents (whether paid or unpaid) are participating securities. As such, unvested restricted stock of the Company are considered participating securities. The dilutive effect of options and their equivalents (including non-vested stock issued under stock-based compensation plans), is computed using the  treasury  method. 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of net income (loss) used in basic and diluted EPS calculations (in thousands, except share amounts):

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis Of Financial Condition and Results Of Operations 
    
  You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the information in our unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included herein, as well as our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the  Risk Factors  section in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as the section below entitled   Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. 
    
  Unless the context otherwise requires, in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,  HC2  means HC2 Holdings, Inc. without its subsidiaries, and the  Company,   we,  "us," and  our,  mean HC2 together with its subsidiaries.  U.S. GAAP  means accounting principles accepted in the United States of America. 

Overview 
    
  We are a diversified holding company with principal operations conducted through seven reportable segments. These segments include Manufacturing, Marine Services, Insurance, Utilities, Telecommunications, Life Sciences, and Other.  Refer to Note   1. Organization and Business   to our unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for additional information. 

Seasonality 
    
  Other than as described below our businesses are not materially affected by seasonality. 
    
  Marine Services 
    
  Net revenue within our Marine Services segment can fluctuate depending on the season. Revenues are relatively stable for our maintenance business as the core driver is the annual contractual obligation. However, this is not the case with our installation business (other than for long-term charter arrangements), in which revenues show a degree of seasonality.  Revenues in the installation business are driven by our customers  need for new cable installations.  Generally, weather downtime, and the additional costs related to downtime, is a significant factor in customers determining their installation schedules, and most installations are therefore scheduled for the warmer months.  As a result, installation revenues are generally lower towards the end of the fourth quarter and throughout the first quarter, as most business is concentrated in the northern hemisphere.  
    
  Telecommunications 
    
  Net revenue within the wholesale telecommunications business can fluctuate throughout the year due to seasonal events.  The first quarter of the year is typically the softest quarter, increasing through the remainder of the year as religious holidays along with typical end of year revenue increases are realized. While seasonality is a factor, the wholesale telecommunications business relies heavily on its sales efforts and customers relationships to drive sales and net margin throughout the year.

Results of Operations 
    
  Results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Presented below is a table that summarizes our results of operations and a comparison of the change between the periods presented (in thousands):   

44 

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   three months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Net revenue:   Net revenue for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased   by   $135.6 million  , or   48.9%  , to   $413.1 million   from   $277.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase was due primarily to growth in the Telecommunications segment of   $77.5 million   as a result of growth in wholesale traffic volumes, added contribution from the acquisition of the Insurance Companies, which were acquired in December 2015, and growth in our Marine Services segment from higher maintenance and installation revenues. 
    
  Income (loss) from operations:   Income from operations for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $5.0 million  , to   $6.9 million  , from   $1.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in income from operations was primarily driven by our Telecommunications and Marine Services segments as a result of increased revenues and a decreased loss at our Non-operating Corporate segment as a result of reduced acquisition-related costs and lower stock compensation expense. The increased income from operations was partially offset by an increase in losses from our Other segment attributed to results from DMi, Inc. and our Life Sciences segment as a result of increased costs associated with our early stage companies. 
    
  Interest expense:   Interest expense   increased     $0.3 million  , or   3.2%  , to   $10.7 million   from   $10.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The increase was due to additional debt assumed as a result of the CWind acquisition.  
    
  Other income (expense), net:   Other income (expense), net   decreased     $4.4 million   to   an expense   of   $3.2 million   from   income   of   $1.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by impairment related to one fixed maturity security and a decrease in foreign currency translation gains to the comparable period.  
    
  Income (loss) from equity investees:   Income from equity investees   decreased     $0.6 million   to   $0.3 million   from   $0.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease in income from equity investees was driven by an increase in losses from our equity investment in Medibeacon in our Life Sciences segment, as well as from a decrease in joint venture income from our Marine Services segment. 
    
  Income tax benefit (expense):   Income tax benefit increased   $2.8 million   to   $1.3 million   from   $1.5 million   of tax expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The benefit recorded in the three months ended September  
  
   45 

30, 2016 relates to losses generated for which we expect to obtain benefits in the future.  The tax benefit associated with losses generated by certain businesses that do not qualify to be included in the Company's U.S. consolidated income tax return may be reduced by a valuation allowance if the facts indicate it is more-likely-than-not that the losses will not be utilized prior to expiration. The expense recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulted primarily from the projected expense as calculated under ASC 740 without applying a valuation allowance.  
    
  Preferred stock dividends:   Preferred stock dividends were   $2.9 million   and   $1.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase is due to inducements in the form of common stock (fully described in Recent Developments) to certain preferred shareholders for the conversion of their Preferred Stock into the Company's common stock. Excluding these inducements the amount of Preferred Stock dividends was   $0.8 million  , or $0.2 million lower than the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Net revenue:   Net revenue   increased   by   $343.9 million  , or   45.2%  , to   $1.1 billion   from   $760.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. This increase was due primarily to our Telecommunications segment, as a result of growth in wholesale traffic volumes, the addition of revenues associated with our Insurance Companies which were acquired in December 2015, and an increase in revenue in our Marine Services segment driven by increased maintenance and installation revenues. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in our Manufacturing segment driven by large projects which were fully engaged in 2015 but having been completed or near completion in the current period, and a decrease in comparable project revenues when compared to the same period last year. 
    
  Income (loss) from operations:   Income (loss) from operations   decreased     $10.7 million   to a loss of   $6.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from a profit of   $4.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in profit in our Marine Services segment in the first half of 2016 and a loss in our Insurance segment which was acquired in December 2015, and were partially offset by improved operating profit at Manufacturing and Telecommunications segments. 
       
  Interest expense:   Interest expense   increased     $2.4 million  , or   8.2%  , to   $31.6 million   from   $29.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase was primarily due to the increase in our 11% Notes Indenture when compared to the same period last year and additional debt assumed as a result of the CWind acquisition. 
    
  Other income (expense), net:   Other income (expense), net   decreased     $2.8 million   to   an expense   of   $4.2 million   from   an expense   of   $1.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease was driven by impairment related to certain fixed maturity securities and a decrease in foreign currency translation gains to the comparable period.  
    
  Income (loss) from equity investees:   Income (loss) from equity investees   increased     $2.7 million   to   income   of   $3.2 million   from   income   of   $0.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in income was driven by growth in joint venture income in our Marine Services segment, principally from its 49% interest in HMN, which has increased its income through sustained growth over the last year. The remainder of the increase is due primarily to a reduction in our share of losses recognized from our Novatel Wireless investment. 
    
  Income tax benefit (expense):   Income tax benefit increased   $1.8 million   to   a benefit   of   $3.6 million   from   a benefit   of   $1.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The benefit recorded in both periods relate to losses generated for which we expect to obtain benefits in the future. The tax benefit associated with losses generated by certain businesses that do not qualify to be included in the U.S. consolidated income tax return may be reduced by a valuation allowance if the facts indicate it is more-likely-than-not that the losses will not be utilized prior to expiration. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a valuation allowance was recorded against the net deferred tax assets of the Insurance Companies. The Insurance Companies are currently ineligible to be included in the Company's U.S. consolidated income tax return. 
    
  Preferred stock dividends:   Preferred stock dividends were   $5.1 million   and   $3.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase is a result of inducements to certain preferred shareholders for the conversion of their Preferred Stock into the Company's common stock.

The increase was largely driven by increased project work in the Southeast and Midwest regions. 
    
  Cost of revenue:   Cost of revenue from our Manufacturing segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $5.3 million  , or   5.3%  , to   $105.2 million   from   $99.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to the increase in revenues. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Manufacturing segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.0 million  , or   10.0%  , to   $11.6 million   from   $10.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to additional employee-related costs, and higher bonus expense due to the segment's improved financial performance. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization:   Depreciation and amortization from our Manufacturing segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $0.1 million  , to   $0.4 million   from   $0.5 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .

The decrease was the result of a gain on sale of a parcel of land held for sale during the three months ended September 30, 2015 without a corresponding gain in the comparable current period. 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Net revenue:   Net revenue from our Manufacturing segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $7.8 million  , or   2.1%  , to   $373.0 million   from   $380.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease was driven by large projects which were fully engaged and nearing completion in 2015 that were not present for the comparable period in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Cost of revenue:   Cost of revenue from our Manufacturing segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $16.5 million  , or   5.2%  , to   $303.0 million   from   $319.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease was driven by the decrease in revenues noted above, in addition to higher margins driven by DBM Global's continued focus on more complex projects. 

47 

Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Manufacturing segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $4.6 million  , or   15.5%  , to   $34.3 million   from   $29.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to additional employee-related costs, and higher  bonus expense due to the segment's improved financial performance. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization:   Depreciation and amortization from our Manufacturing segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $0.2 million  , to   $1.3 million   from   $1.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Other operating (income) expense:   Other operating (income) expense from our Manufacturing segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $0.9 million  , to income of   $1.0 million   from income of   $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily driven by a gain on disposal of assets held for sale in the current year when compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Marine Services 
    
  Presented below is a table that summarizes the results of operations of our Marine Services segment and compares the amount of the change between the periods presented (in thousands): 

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   three months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Net revenue:   Net revenue from our Marine Services segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $15.6 million  , or   44.5%  , to   $50.7 million   from   $35.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to higher maintenance revenues which were largely driven by the addition of CWind, as well as from higher installation revenues driven by projects in the telecom and offshore power markets. 
    
  Cost of revenue:   Cost of revenue from our Marine Services segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $11.9 million  , or   50.1%  , to   $35.6 million   from   $23.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was largely driven by the increase in net revenue and the addition of CWind which were offset in part by a $1.5 million improvement in estimated costs recognized in the first quarter of 2016 on a telecommunications installation project off the northeastern coast of Russia. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Marine Services segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.6 million  , or   51.0%  , to   $4.7 million   from   $3.1 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to the addition of selling, general and administrative costs of CWind that were not present in the 2015 comparable period. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization:   Depreciation and amortization from our Marine Services segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.8 million  , or   16.7%  , to   $5.6 million   from   $4.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to the acquired CWind assets that were not present in the 2015 comparable period. 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Net revenue:   Net revenue from our Marine Services segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $10.4 million  , or   9.8%  , to   $116.3 million   from   $105.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase is attributable  
  
   48 

to increased maintenance revenues mainly attributable to the addition of CWind which were partially offset by lower installation revenues of $12.4 million.  
  Cost of revenue:   Cost of revenue from our Marine Services segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $12.5 million  , or   17.2%  , to   $85.4 million   from   $72.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in costs of revenue was due to higher maintenance revenues, $4.0 million of costs recognized for a loss on a telecommunications installation project off the northeastern coast of Russia which resulted from administrative delays by the customer and adverse weather conditions arriving earlier in the season, and the results from the acquisition of CWind. These increases were offset by a reduction of installation project costs due to lower revenues.  
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Marine Services segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $5.8 million  , or   67.3%  , to   $14.3 million   from   $8.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to the addition of selling, general and administrative costs of CWind that were not present in the 2015 comparable period. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization:   Depreciation and amortization from our Marine Services segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $2.7 million  , or   18.9%  , to   $16.8 million   from   $14.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to the acquired CWind assets that were not present in the 2015 comparable period. 
    
  Insurance 
    
  Presented below is a table that summarizes the results of operations of our Insurance segment and describes the activity for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016    
    
  Life, accident and health earned premiums, net:   Life, accident and health earned premiums, net were   $20.0 million   and   $59.9 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and consisted primarily of premiums earned on long-term care insurance policies totaling $17.8 million and $53.3 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  
    
  Net investment income:   Net investment income consists primarily of interest income and dividends earned from investments in fixed maturity and equity securities, respectively.  The balance of   $14.8 million   and   $42.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, was primarily driven by interest income, net of amortization of the discount or premium, of $14.0 million and $40.4 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. Dividends totaled $0.4 million and $1.5 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
    
  Net realized losses on investments:   Realized losses on investments of   $0.2 million   and   $2.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, resulted primarily from sales of low yield fixed maturity securities, fixed maturity securities with a risk of credit downgrades, and mark to market adjustments on certain interest only bonds and warrants accounted for under ASC 815. Sales resulted in net realized gains of $0.6 million and net realized losses of $0.6 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively. Changes in fair value of securities resulted in net realized losses of $0.8 million and $1.9 million for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively.  

49 

Policy benefits, changes in reserves, and commissions:   Policy benefits, changes in reserves, and commissions for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were   $29.7 million   and   $92.8 million  , respectively, which consisted of benefit expenses and reserve changes for long-term care, life and annuity policies plus renewal commissions paid to agents. The reserve was increased during the periods due primarily to the interest earned on the beginning reserve balances plus premiums received during the three and nine month periods exceeding benefits paid out during the periods.  
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $6.4 million   and   $15.9 million  , respectively, were primarily the result of (i) salaries and benefits of $2.8 million and $7.2 million, (ii) post-acquisition transaction services provided by the Seller Parties of $1.2 million and $3.6 million, (iii) accounting, actuarial, and tax consulting services of $1.4 million and $3.9 million, and (iv) premium taxes of $0.5 million and $1.6 million, all respectively.  
    
  Depreciation and amortization:   Depreciation and amortization for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $1.2 million   and   $2.9 million  , respectively, largely driven by the amortization of VOBA, a liability established in purchase accounting.  
    
  Telecommunications  
    
  Presented below is a table that summarizes the results of operations of our Telecommunications segment and compares the amount of the change between the periods presented (in thousands): 

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   three months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Net revenue:   Net revenue from our Telecommunications segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $77.5 million  , or   66.3%  , to   $194.4 million   from   $116.9 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to growth in wholesale traffic volumes in part delivered by the changing regulatory environment throughout the European market combined with the religious holidays in the Middle East region. The changing customer base has included a shift in sales focus towards larger telecommunications carriers with higher volume opportunity and lower credit risk.  
    
  Cost of revenue:   Cost of revenue from our Telecommunications segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $75.9 million  , to   $190.3 million  , or   66.4%  , from   $114.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was directly correlated to the increase in net revenue. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Telecommunications segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.1 million  , or   8.1%  , to   $1.9 million   from   $1.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries and benefits related to increased headcount as well as travel and entertainment expense to support the increase in revenue. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization:   Depreciation and amortization from our Telecommunications segment for each of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 was essentially unchanged. 
    
  Other operating (income) expense:   Other operating expense from our Telecommunications segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $1.3 million   to income of   $0.2 million   from expense of   $1.1 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease is attributable to a lease impairment on a legacy switch site recorded in fiscal year 2015  
  
   50 

when compared to the corresponding period for 2016. 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Net revenue:   Net revenue from our Telecommunications segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $240.7 million  , to   $508.2 million  , or   90.0%  , from   $267.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to growth in wholesale traffic volumes in part delivered by the changing regulatory environment throughout the European market combined with the religious holidays in the Middle East region. The changing customer base has included a shift in sales focus towards larger telecom carriers with higher volume opportunity and lower credit risk.  
    
  Cost of revenue:   Cost of revenue from our Telecommunications segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $236.8 million  , or   90.5%  , to   $498.6 million   from   $261.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase is directly correlated to the growth in net revenue. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Telecommunications segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.7 million  , or   15.1%  , to   $5.7 million   from   $4.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries and benefits due to increased headcount as well as travel and entertainment expense to support the increase in revenue. This was offset by a decrease in rent expense when compared to the corresponding period for 2015. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization:   Depreciation and amortization from our Telecommunications segment for each of   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 was essentially unchanged. 
    
  Other operating (income) expense:   Other operating expense from our Telecommunications segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $1.0 million   to expense of   $0.2 million   from expense of   $1.2 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease is attributable to a lease impairment on a legacy switch site recorded in fiscal year 2015 when compared to the corresponding period for 2016. 
    
  Utilities 
    
  Presented below is a table that summarizes the results of operations of our Utilities segment and compares the amount of the change between the periods presented (in thousands): 

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Net revenue:   Net revenue from our Utilities segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 decreased   $0.2 million   or   10%   and   $0.3 million   or   6%  , respectively. These decreases were driven by a decrease in design and build project revenue, which was largely offset by the growth in the Own, Operate and Maintain ("OOM") business due to an increase in the number of fueling stations. 
    
  Cost of revenue:   Cost of revenue from our Utilities segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $0.5 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively. The decrease was due primarily to the reduction in design and build project revenue, which typically generates higher cost of revenue and lower margin than recurring revenue generated through compressed natural gas sales from our OOM business. 

51 

Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Utilities segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 both decreased   $0.2 million   driven by lower salary costs. 
  Depreciation and amortization:   Depreciation and amortization from our Utilities segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 increased   $0.2 million  , or   41%  , and   $0.3 million  , or   23%  , respectively, driven by depreciation of new fueling stations which came online in 2016.  
    
  Life Sciences 
    
  Presented below is a table that summarizes the results of operations of our Life Sciences segment and compares the amount of the change between the periods presented (in thousands): 

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses:   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Life Sciences segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 increased   $0.7 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively. The increases were primarily due to additional investment in BeneVir in the first quarter of 2016, which we began to consolidate on February 1, 2016, and additional headcount and research and development expenses associated with our early stage companies. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization:   Depreciation and amortization from our Life Sciences segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 both increased primarily to the consolidation of BeneVir. 
    
  Other 
    
  Presented below is a table that summarizes the results of operations of our Other segment and compares the amount of the change between the periods presented (in thousands): 

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   three months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Net revenue.   Net revenue from our Other segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.5 million  , to   $2.3 million   from   $0.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to the release of NASCAR        Heat Evolution game by DMi in September 2016 with higher initial game sales than company sales during the same period in 2015. 
    
  Cost of revenue.   Cost of revenue from our Other segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.7 million  , to   $2.1 million   from   $1.4 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was driven by an increase in cost of revenue associated with the sales of NASCAR        Heat Evolution in September 2016. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Other segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.6 million  , to   $2.1 million   from   $0.5 million   for the   three months ended  
  
   52 

September 30, 2015  . The increase was due to compensation, marketing and advertising expenses associated with the release of console and PC versions of NASCAR        Heat Evolution in September 2016.  
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Net revenue.   Net revenue from our Other segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.1 million  , to   $2.6 million   from   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily driven by the release of the NASCAR        Heat Evolution       game which was released in September 2016. 
    
  Cost of revenue.   Cost of revenue from our Other segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.6 million  , to   $4.4 million   from   $2.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily driven by an increase in royalties, disc manufacturing, and game development costs related to NASCAR        Heat Evolution which was released in September 2016. 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Other segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $2.1 million  , to   $3.8 million   from   $1.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase was due to compensation, marketing and advertising expenses associated with the release of console and PC versions of the NASCAR        Heat Evolution game in September 2016.  
    
  Non-operating Corporate 
    
  Presented below is a table that summarizes the results of operations of our Non-operating Corporate segment and compares the amount of the change between the periods presented (in thousands): 

Three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses from our Non-operating Corporate segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015   decreased     $2.9 million   and   $1.4 million  , respectively. The decreases were primarily attributable to decreases in both acquisition related expenses and share-based compensation, partially offset by an increase in headcount, overhead, and consulting fees to support growth in the business. 
    
  Income (loss) from Equity Investments 
    
  Presented below is a table that summarizes the income (loss) from equity investments within our Marine Services, Life Sciences, and Other segments and compares the amount of the change between the periods presented (in thousands): 

Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   three months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Marine Services.   Income from equity investments from our Marine Services segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $0.2 million  , or   5.8%  , to   $3.8 million   from   $4.0 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This was driven by the performance of GMSL's joint venture investments. 
    
  Life Sciences.   Loss from equity investments from our Life Sciences segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016    
  
   53 

increased     $0.3 million   to   $0.5 million   from   $0.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in loss was due to loss in our equity investment in Medibeacon. 
  Other and eliminations.   Loss from equity investments from our Other segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 remained consistent. Increased equity losses from Novatel Wireless, Inc. were offset by a reduction in equity losses related to NerVve, prior to its consolidation on August 17, 2016. 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  Marine Services.   Income from equity investments from our Marine Services segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $2.2 million  ,   24.9%  , to   $11.2 million   from   $9.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in income was due to growth in GMSL's joint venture income, specifically driven by HMN which has increased its income through sustained growth over the last year. 
    
  Life Sciences.   Loss from equity investments from our Life Sciences segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.7 million  , or   143.6%  , to   $1.2 million   from   $0.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase was due to our equity investment in Medibeacon. 
    
  Other and eliminations.   Loss from equity investments from our Other segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $1.2 million  , or   15.0%  , to   $6.9 million   from   $8.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . A decrease in equity losses of $1.4 million related to NerVve, prior to its consolidation on August 17, 2016, was offset by an increase in equity loss from Novatel Wireless, Inc. of $0.4 million over the same period in the prior year. 

Explanation of Use of Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures 
    
  In addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management uses, and this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains or references, certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, such as Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Operating Income for the Insurance segment. 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA  
    
  Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement recognized under U.S. GAAP. In addition, other companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, which could limit its usefulness. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is meaningful to gaining an understanding of our results as it is frequently used by the financial community to provide insight into an organization s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies, because interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and the other items listed in the definition of Adjusted EBITDA below can differ greatly between organizations as a result of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA can also be a useful measure of a company s ability to service debt. However, while management believes Adjusted EBITDA is useful as supplemental information, the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace our U.S. GAAP financial results. Adjusted EBITDA does not include the results of our Insurance segment. 
    
  Using Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure has inherent limitations as an analytical tool as compared to net income (loss) or other U.S. GAAP financial measures, as this non-GAAP measure excludes certain items, including items that are recurring in nature, which may be meaningful to investors. As a result of the exclusions, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation and does not purport to be an alternative to net income (loss) or other U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance. 
    
   The calculation of Adjusted EBITDA, as defined by us, consists of Net income (loss) as adjusted for depreciation and amortization; (gain) loss on sale or disposal of assets; lease termination costs; (gain) loss on early extinguishment or restructuring of debt; interest expense; other (income) expense, net; foreign currency transaction (gain) loss; income tax (benefit) expense; (gain) loss from discontinued operations; noncontrolling interest; share-based compensation expense; acquisition and nonrecurring items; and other costs. 
    
  Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the   three months ended September 30, 2015    
    
  Our Adjusted EBITDA was   $18.2 million   and   $14.2 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The overall increase is attributed to an increase in our Marine Services segment of   $3.9 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016, driven by higher maintenance and installation revenues when compared to the same period in 2015,  
  
   54 

as well as by an increase in our Telecommunications segment of   $1.4 million   for the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to growth in wholesale traffic volumes when compared to the same period in 2015.  

(*)   
    Includes depreciation adjustments from purchase accounting as more fully described in Note 2. Adjustments of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
        
  Manufacturing.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Manufacturing segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   remained essentially unchanged when compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Marine Services.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Marine Services segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $3.9 million   to   $14.1 million   from   $10.1 million   when compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase was due to higher maintenance and offshore power installation revenues.  
    
  Telecommunications.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Telecommunications segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.4 million   to   $2.2 million   from   $0.8 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was  
  
   55 

due primarily to growth in wholesale traffic volumes in part delivered by the changing regulatory environment throughout the European market combined with the religious holidays in the Middle East region. 
  Utilities.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Utilities segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $0.5 million   to   $0.7 million   from   $0.3 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   due to increased revenue in the OOM business. 
    
  Life Sciences.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Life Sciences segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $0.9 million  , to   $(2.9) million   from   $(2.0) million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   due to increased costs within early stage companies. 
    
  Other.   Adjusted EBITDA from the Other segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     0.8 million   to   $(4.8) million   from   $(4.1) million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in adjusted EBITDA was attributable  to increased development costs coupled with additional selling, general and administrative expenses related to DMi's release of the NASCAR        Heat Evolution game in September 2016. 
    
  Non-operating Corporate.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Non-operating Corporate segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   remained essentially unchanged when compared to the   three months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was due to increases in acquisition and non-recurring costs in 2016. 
    
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the   nine months ended September 30, 2015 
    
  Our Adjusted EBITDA was   $33.7 million   and   $39.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  The overall decrease can be primarily attributed to a reduction in our Marine Services segment of   $5.2 million   due to a decline in ongoing installation projects when compared to the same period in 2015 and to $4.0 million of costs recognized for an expected loss on a project that had been subject to administrative delays and adverse weather conditions. Also contributing to the decrease were increased losses in our Non-Operating Corporate segment of   $2.5 million   and from early stage investments in our Life Sciences segment of   $3.0 million  . Partially offsetting these decreases were increases from our Manufacturing segment of $1.7 million, due primarily to higher margins driven by DBM Global's continued focus on more complex projects, and from our Telecommunications segment of $1.7 million, which can be primarily attributed to increased profit contribution as a result of the growth in revenue.

    Includes depreciation adjustments from purchase accounting as more fully described in Note 2. Adjustments to our unaudited financial statement included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
        
  Manufacturing.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Manufacturing segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $1.8 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was largely driven by reduction in costs of revenue due to higher margins driven by DBM Global's continued focus on more complex projects. 
    
  Marine Services.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Marine Services segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $5.2 million   to   $26.4 million   from   $31.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease was due primarily to $4.0 million of costs recognized on an installation project off the northeastern coast of Russia which resulted from administrative delays by the customer and adverse weather conditions arriving earlier in the season. This was further decreased by lower installation revenues in the first half of the year. 
    
  Telecommunications.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Telecommunications segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $3.1 million   to   $4.0 million   from   $1.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due primarily to increased profit contribution from growth in wholesale traffic volumes resulting from continued expansion in the scale and number of customer relationships. 
    
  Utilities.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Utilities segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     increased     $1.1 million   to   $1.7 million   from   $0.6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to increased revenue in their OOM business. 
    
  Life Sciences.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Life Sciences segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $3.0 million   to   $(8.2) million   from   $(5.2) million   for   nine months ended September 30, 2015   the due to increased costs at early stage subsidiaries. 
    
  Other.   Adjusted EBITDA from the Other segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decreased     $2.5 million   to   $(12.1) million   from   $(10.9) million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in loss was due primarily to increases in DMi's development and sales costs, and selling, general and administrative expenses related to the release of the  NASCAR        Heat Evolution game in September 2016. 
    
  Non-operating Corporate.   Adjusted EBITDA from our Non-operating Corporate segment for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased $2.5 million when compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was due to increases  
  
   57 

in acquisition and non-recurring costs in 2016. 
  Adjusted Operating Income - Insurance 
    
  Adjusted Operating Income for the Insurance segment ( Insurance AOI ) is a non-US GAAP financial measure frequently used throughout the insurance industry and is an economic measure the Insurance segment uses to evaluate its financial performance. Management believes that Insurance AOI measures provide investors with meaningful information for gaining an understanding of certain results and provides insight into an organization s operating trends and facilitates comparisons between peer companies. However, Insurance AOI has certain limitations, including that we may not calculate it the same as other companies in our industry and therefore should be read together with the Company's results calculated in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  Similarly to Adjusted EBITDA, using Insurance AOI as a performance measure has inherent limitations as an analytical tool as compared to income (loss) from operations or other U.S. GAAP financial measures, as this non-GAAP measure excludes certain items, including items that are recurring in nature, which may be meaningful to investors. As a result of the exclusions, Insurance AOI should not be considered in isolation and does not purport to be an alternative to income (loss) from operations or other U.S. GAAP financial measures as a measure of our operating performance. 
    
  Management defines Insurance AOI as Net income (loss) for the Insurance segment adjusted to exclude the impact of net investment gains (losses), including other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in operations; intercompany elimination and acquisition and non-recurring items. Management believes that Insurance AOI provides a meaningful financial metric that helps investors understand certain results and profitability. While these adjustments are an integral part of the overall performance of the Insurance segment, market conditions impacting these items can overshadow the underlying performance of the business. Accordingly, we believe using a measure which excludes their impact is effective in analyzing the trends of our operations. 
    
  The table below shows the adjustments made to the reported net (loss) income of the Insurance segment to calculate Insurance AOI (in millions): 

Net loss and Adjusted Operating Income for the first quarter 2016 have been adjusted to exclude certain intercompany eliminations to better reflect the results of the Insurance Companies, and remain consistent with internally reported metrics. For the first quarter of 2016, this resulted in a change to the previously reported Insurance net loss of $12.3 million to a net loss of $7.5 million and a change to the previously reported Insurance Adjusted Operating Income of $3.6 million to a loss of $2.6 million. 

Constant Currency 
    
  When we refer to operating results on a constant currency basis, this means operating results without the impact of the currency exchange rate fluctuations.  We calculate constant currency results using the prior year's currency exchange rate for both periods presented.  We believe the disclosure of operating results on a constant currency basis permits investors to better understand our underlying performance. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Consolidated 
    
  Short and Long-Term Liquidity Considerations and Risks 
    
  We are a holding company and our liquidity needs are primarily for interest payments on our 11.0% Notes and dividend payments on our Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (the  Series A Preferred Stock ), Series A-1 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (the  Series A-1 Preferred Stock ) and Series A-2 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock (the  Series A-2 Preferred Stock  and, together with the Series A Preferred Stock and Series A-1 Preferred Stock, the  Preferred Stock ). We also have liquidity needs related to recurring operational expenses.  
  
   58 

As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $121.3 million   of cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis compared to   $158.6 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016  , HC2 had cash and cash equivalents of   $29.4 million   compared to   $41.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . At September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents in our Insurance segment was   $28.3 million  .  
    
  Our subsidiaries' principal liquidity requirements arise from cash used in operating activities and capital expenditures, 
  including purchases of network equipment (such as switches, related transmission equipment and capacity), fueling stations and 
  service infrastructure, liabilities associated with insurance products, steel manufacturing equipment and subsea cable equipment, development of back-office systems, operating costs and expenses, and income taxes. 
    
   As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $396.7 million   of indebtedness on a consolidated basis compared to   $371.9 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $41.7 million   in liquidation value of outstanding Preferred Stock compared to   $52.6 million   as of   December 31, 2015  .  We are required to make semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding 11.0% Notes on June 1   st    and December 1   st    of each year.  We are required to make dividend payments on our outstanding Preferred Stock on January 15   th   , April 15   th   , July 15   th   , and October 15   th    of each year.  
    
  Under a tax sharing agreement, DBM Global reimburses HC2 for use of our Net Operating Losses. In 2016, HC2 received $22.4 million from DBM Global under this tax sharing agreement. 
    
  We have financed our growth and operations to date, and expect to finance our future growth and operations, through public offerings and private placements of debt and equity securities, credit facilities, vendor financing, capital lease financing and other financing arrangements, as well as cash generated from the operations of our subsidiaries. In the future, we may also choose to sell assets or certain investments to generate cash. 
    
  At this time, we believe that we will be able to continue to meet our liquidity requirements and fund our fixed obligations (such as debt services and operating leases) and other cash needs for our operations for at least the next twelve months through a combination of distributions from our subsidiaries and from raising of additional equity or debt capital, refinancing of certain of our indebtedness or Preferred Stock, other financing arrangements and/or the sale of assets and certain investments. Historically, we have chosen to reinvest cash and receivables into the growth of our various businesses, and therefore have not kept a large amount of cash on hand at the holding company level, a practice which we expect to continue in the future. The ability of HC2 s subsidiaries to make distributions to HC2 is subject to numerous factors, including restrictions contained in each subsidiary s financing agreements, availability of sufficient funds at each subsidiary and the approval of such payment by each subsidiary s board of directors, which must consider various factors, including general economic and business conditions, tax considerations, strategic plans, financial results and condition, expansion plans, any contractual, legal or regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends, and such other factors each subsidiary s board of directors considers relevant. Our ability to sell assets and certain of our investments to meet our existing financing needs may also be limited by our existing financing instruments. Although the Company believes that it will be able to raise additional equity capital, refinance indebtedness or Preferred Stock, enter into other financing arrangements or engage in asset sales and sales of certain investments sufficient to fund any cash needs that we are not able to satisfy with the funds expected to be provided by our subsidiaries, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so on terms satisfactory to the Company if at all. Such financing options, if pursued, may also ultimately have the effect of negatively impacting our liquidity profile and prospects over the long-term.  In addition, the sale of assets or the Company s investments may also make the Company less attractive to potential investors or future financing partners.  
    
  Insurance Companies Capital Contributions 
    
  In connection with the acquisition of Insurance Companies in December 2015, the Company contributed approximately $33.0 million of additional assets to the Insurance Companies, as required by the acquisition agreement governing the purchase. The contribution was made for the purpose of satisfying the reserve release amount of $13.0 million and offsetting the impact on the acquired companies  statutory capital and surplus of the election to be made by the Company and Seller Parties pursuant to Section 338(h)(10) of the Internal Revenue Code in connection with the transaction as soon as possible after closing. 
    
  In connection with the consummation of the acquisition, the Company agreed with the Ohio Department of Insurance ("ODOI") that, for five years following the closing of the transaction, the Company will contribute to CGI cash or marketable securities acceptable to the ODOI to the extent required for CGI s total adjusted capital to be not less than 400% of CGI s authorized control level risk-based capital (each as defined under Ohio law and reported in CGI s statutory statements filed with the ODOI). Similarly, the Company has agreed with the Texas Department of Insurance ("TDOI") that, for five years following the closing of the

transaction, it will contribute to UTA cash or other admitted assets acceptable to the TDOI to the extent required for UTA s total adjusted capital to be not less than 400% of UTA s authorized control level risk-based capital (each as defined under Texas law and reported in UTA s statutory statements filed with the TDOI). 
    
  Also in connection with the consummation of the acquisition, each of CGI and UTA also entered into a capital maintenance agreement (each, a  Capital Maintenance Agreement , and collectively, the  Capital Maintenance Agreements ) with Great American Financial Resources, Inc. ( Great American ). Under each Capital Maintenance Agreement, if the applicable acquired company s total adjusted capital reported in its annual statutory financial statements is less than 400% of its authorized control level risk-based capital, Great American has agreed to pay cash or assets to the applicable acquired company as required to eliminate such shortfall (after giving effect to any capital contributions made by the Company or its affiliates since the date of the relevant annual statutory financial statement). Great American s obligation to make such payments is capped at $25.0 million under the Capital Maintenance Agreement with UTA and $10.0 million under the Capital Maintenance Agreement with CGI (each, a  Cap ). Each of the Capital Maintenance Agreements will remain in effect from January 1, 2016 to January 1, 2021 or until payments by Great American under the applicable agreement equal the applicable Cap. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the Company is required to indemnify Great American for the amount of any payments made by Great American under the Capital Maintenance Agreements. 
    
  Indebtedness 
    
  See Note   12. Long-Term Obligations  , to the unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for a description of our long-term debt.      
    
  Restrictive Covenants 
    
  The indenture governing our 11.0% Notes (the "11.0% Notes Indenture") contains certain covenants limiting, among other things, the ability of the Company and certain subsidiaries of the Company to incur additional indebtedness; create liens; engage in sale-leaseback transactions; pay dividends or make distributions in respect of capital stock and make certain restricted payments; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; or consolidate or merge with, or sell substantially all of its assets to, another person.  These covenants are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. 
    
  The 11% Notes Indenture also includes two maintenance covenants:  (1) a liquidity covenant; and (2) a collateral coverage covenant.   
    
  The liquidity covenant provides that the Company will not permit the aggregate amount of all unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of the Company and the Guarantors to be less than the Company s obligations to pay interest on the 11.0% Notes and all other debt of the Company and the Guarantors, plus mandatory cash dividends on the Company s Preferred Stock, for the next (i) 6 months if our collateral coverage ratio is greater than 2.0x or (ii) 12 months if our collateral coverage ratio is less than 2.0x. As of September 30, 2016, our collateral coverage ratio was greater than 2.0x and therefore the liquidity covenant requires the Company to maintain 6 months of debt service and preferred dividend obligations. If the collateral coverage ratio subsequently becomes lower than 2:1 in the future, the maintenance of liquidity requirement under the 11% Notes will be increased back to 12 months of debt service and preferred dividend obligations. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with this covenant. 
    
  The collateral coverage covenant provides that the Company s Collateral Coverage Ratio (defined in the 11.0% Notes Indenture as the ratio of (i) the Loan Collateral to (ii) Consolidated Secured Debt (each as defined therein)) calculated on a pro forma basis as of the last day of each fiscal quarter may not be less than 1.25:1.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with this covenant.  
    
  The instruments governing the Company s Preferred Stock also limit the Company s and its subsidiaries ability to take certain actions, including, among other things, to incur additional indebtedness; issue additional Preferred Stock; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make certain restricted payments. These limitations are subject to a number of important exceptions and qualifications. 
    
  Summary of Consolidated Cash Flows 
    
  Presented below is a table that summarizes the cash provided or used in our activities and the amount of the respective increases  
  
   60 

or decreases in cash provided or used from those activities between the fiscal periods (in thousands): 

Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities totaled   $55.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to a use of cash of   $31.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The   $86.1 million   increase in cash provided by operating activities was largely the result of a decrease in working capital, driven by increases in insurance reserves from premiums collected in 2016 and a lower working capital increase in our Manufacturing segment.  
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $80.1 million   primarily due to   $179.3 million   for the purchase of investments primarily in our Insurance segment,   $21.7 million   of capital expenditures and   $7.8 million   paid for the acquisition of CWind, partially offset by   $72.2 million   from the sale of investments,   $8.0 million   in contributions by noncontrolling interest and   $0.5 million   in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment. 
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $46.4 million   primarily driven by $  41.7 million   for the purchase of investments at HC2 and $  16.8 million   of capital expenditures. 
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $10.9 million   primarily driven by   $15.6 million   in annuity surrenders and $  11.4 million   used to make principal payments on our credit facilities, partially offset by $  11.7 million   of proceeds from long term obligations. 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $55.3 million   primarily driven by $  55.0 million   of proceeds from the 11% Senior Secured Notes and $  14.0 million   of proceeds from the issuance of Series A-2 preferred stock, partially offset by $  8.5 million   used to make principal payments on our long term obligations. 

Manufacturing 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Cash flows from operating activities are the principal source of cash used to fund DBM Global s operating expenses, interest payments on debt, and capital expenditures. DBM Global's short-term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations including receivables, inventories, and other costs incurred in performing its contracts. DBM Global attempts to structure the payment arrangements under its contracts to match costs incurred under the project. To the extent it is able to bill in advance of costs incurred, DBM Global generates working capital through billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings on uncompleted contracts. To the extent it is not able to bill in advance of costs, DBM Global relies on its credit facilities to meet its working capital needs. DBM Global believes that its existing borrowing availability together with cash from operations will be adequate to meet all funding requirements for its operating expenses, interest payments on debt and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.  
    
  DBM Global is required to make monthly and quarterly interest and principal payments depending on the structure of each individual debt agreement.  
    
  DBM Global estimates that its capital expenditures for   2016   will be approximately   $8.2 million  . It believes that its available funds, cash generated by operating activities and funds available under its bank credit facilities will be sufficient to fund these  
  
   61 

capital expenditures and its working capital needs. However, DBM Global may expand its operations through future acquisitions and may require additional equity or debt financing.  

Marine Services  
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Cash flows from operating activities are the principal source of cash used to fund GMSL s operating expenses, interest payments on debt, and capital expenditures. GMSL's short-term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations including receivables, inventories, and other costs incurred in performing its contracts. GMSL attempts to structure the payment arrangements under its contracts to match costs incurred under the project. To the extent it is able to bill in advance of costs incurred, GMSL generates working capital through billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings on uncompleted contracts. To the extent it is not able to bill in advance of costs, GMSL relies on its credit facilities to meet its working capital needs. GMSL believes that its existing borrowing availability together with cash from operations will be adequate to meet all funding requirements for its operating expenses, interest payments on debt and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future.  
    
  GMSL is required to make monthly and quarterly interest and principal payments depending on the structure of each individual debt agreement.  
    
  Market Environment 
    
  GMSL earns revenues in a variety of currencies including the US dollar, the Singapore dollar and the British pound.  The exchange rates between the US dollar, the Singapore dollar and the British pound have fluctuated in recent periods and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Any material appreciation or depreciation of these currencies against each other may have a negative impact on GMSL's results of operations and financial condition. 

Insurance 
    
  Cash flows 
    
  CIG s principal cash inflows from its operating activities relate to its premiums, annuity deposits and insurance, investment product fees and other income. CIG s principal cash inflows from its invested assets result from investment income and the maturity and sales of invested assets. The primary liquidity concern with respect to these cash inflows relates to the risk of default by debtors and interest rate volatility. Additional sources of liquidity to meet unexpected cash outflows in excess of operating cash inflows and current cash and equivalents on hand include selling short-term investments or fixed maturity securities. 
    
  CIG's principal cash outflows relate to the payment of claims liabilities, interest credited and operating expenses. CIG s management believes its current sources of liquidity are adequate to meet its cash requirements for the next 12 months. 
    
  Market environment 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , CIG was in a position to hold any investment security showing an unrealized loss until recovery, provided it remains comfortable with the credit of the issuer. CIG does not rely on short-term funding or commercial paper and to date it has experienced no liquidity pressure, nor does it anticipate such pressure in the foreseeable future. CIG projects its reserves to be sufficient and believes its current capital base is adequate to support its business.  
    
  Dividend Limitations 
    
  CIG is subject to Texas and Ohio statutory provisions that restrict the payment of dividends. The dividend limitations on CIG are based on statutory financial results and regulatory approval. Statutory accounting practices differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Significant differences include the treatment of deferred income taxes, required investment reserves, reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes.  
    
  The ability of CIG s subsidiaries to pay dividends and to make such other payments is limited by applicable laws and regulations of the states in which its subsidiaries are domiciled, which subject its subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions.  These laws and regulations require, among other things, CIG s insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit  
  
   62 

the amount of dividends these subsidiaries can pay.  Along with solvency regulations, the primary driver in determining the amount of capital used for dividends is the level of capital needed to maintain desired financial strength in the form of its subsidiaries Risk-Based Capital ( RBC ) ratio.  CIG monitors its insurance subsidiaries  compliance with the RBC requirements specified by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. As of   September 30, 2016  , each of CIG s insurance subsidiaries exceeds the minimum RBC requirements.  CIG s insurance subsidiaries paid no dividends to CIG in fiscal year 2016 and have further each agreed with each of their respective state regulators to not pay dividends for three years following the completion of the acquisition on December 24, 2015. 
    
  Asset Liability Management  
    
  CIG s insurance subsidiaries maintain investment strategies intended to provide adequate funds to pay benefits without forced sales of investments.  Products having liabilities with longer durations, such as long-term care insurance, are matched with investments such as long-term fixed maturity securities.  Shorter-term liabilities are matched with fixed maturity securities that have short- and medium-term fixed maturities.  The types of assets in which CIG may invest are influenced by state laws, which prescribe qualified investment assets applicable to insurance companies.  Within the parameters of these laws, CIG invests in assets giving consideration to four primary investment objectives: (i) maintain robust absolute returns; (ii) provide reliable yield and investment income; (iii) preserve capital and (iv) provide liquidity to meet policyholder and other corporate obligations.  The Insurance segment s investment portfolio is designed to contribute stable earnings and balance risk across diverse asset classes and is primarily invested in high quality fixed income securities.  In addition, at any given time, CIG s insurance subsidiaries could hold cash, highly liquid, high-quality short-term investment securities and other liquid investment grade fixed maturity securities to fund anticipated operating expenses, surrenders and withdrawals. 
    
  Investments 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of CIG s investment portfolio was approximately   $1.5 billion   and   $1.3 billion  , respectively, and was divided among the following asset classes (in thousands): 

(*) Balance includes fair value of certain securities held by the Company, which are either eliminated on consolidation or reported within other invested assets. 
    
  Credit Quality 
    
  Insurance statutes regulate the type of investments that CIG is permitted to make and limit the amount of funds that may be used for any one type of investment.  In light of these statutes and regulations, and CIG's business and investment strategy, CIG generally seeks to invest in (i) securities rated investment grade by established nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (each, a nationally recognized statistical rating organization ( NRSRO )), (ii) U.S. Government and government-sponsored agency securities, or (iii) securities of comparable investment quality, if not rated. 

63 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , CIG's fixed maturity portfolio was approximately   $1.3 billion   and   $1.2 billion  , respectively. The following table summarizes the credit quality, by NRSRO rating, of CIG's fixed income portfolio (in thousands): 

Other Invested Assets 
    
  The Company's other invested assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized as follows (in thousands): 

64 

Foreign Currency 
    
  Foreign currency translation can impact our financial results. During the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , approximately 34.1% and 37.5% respectively, of our net revenue from continuing operations was derived from sales and operations outside the U.S.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , approximately 30.4% and 35.0% respectively, of our net revenue from continuing operations was derived from sales and operations outside the U.S. The reporting currency for our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements is the United States dollar ( USD ). The local currency of each country is the functional currency for each of our respective entities operating in that country. 
    
  In the future, we expect to continue to derive a portion of our net revenue and incur a portion of our operating costs from outside the U.S., and therefore changes in exchange rates may continue to have a significant, and potentially adverse, effect on our results of operations. Our risk of loss regarding foreign currency exchange rate risk is caused primarily by fluctuations in the USD/British pound sterling ( GBP ) exchange rate. Changes in the exchange rate of USD relative to the GBP could have an adverse impact on our future results of operations. We have agreements with certain subsidiaries for repayment of a portion of the investments and advances made to these subsidiaries. As we anticipate repayment in the foreseeable future, we recognize the unrealized gains and losses in foreign currency transaction gain (loss) on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The exposure of our income from operations to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is reduced in part because a majority of the costs that we incur in connection with our foreign operations are also denominated in local currencies. 
    
  We are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries. We translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into USD using the average exchange rate during the reporting period. Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the reported profits and losses and cash flows of our international subsidiaries and may distort comparisons from year to year. By way of example, when the USD strengthens compared to the GBP, there could be a negative or positive effect on the reported results for our Telecommunications segment, depending upon whether such businesses are operating profitably or at a loss. More profits in GBP are required to generate the same amount of profits in USD and a greater loss in GBP to generate the same amount of loss in USD, and vice versa. For instance, when the USD weakens against the GBP, there is a positive effect on reported profits and a negative effect on reported losses. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  DBM Global 
    
  DBM Global s off-balance sheet arrangements at   September 30, 2016   included letters of credit of $4.0 million under a credit and security agreement with Wells Fargo Credit, Inc. and performance bonds of   $49.4 million  . 
    
  DBM Global s contract arrangements with customers sometimes require DBM Global to provide performance bonds to partially secure its obligations under its contracts. Bonding requirements typically arise in connection with public works projects and sometimes with respect to certain private contracts. DBM Global s performance bonds are obtained through surety companies and typically cover the entire project price.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Market Risk Factors 
    
  Market risk is the risk of the loss of fair value resulting from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and equity prices. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying financial instruments are traded. We are exposed to market risk with respect to our investments and foreign currency exchange rates. Through DBM Global, we have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates charged on its borrowings and from adverse changes in steel prices. Through GMSL and ANG, we have market risk exposure from changes in interest rates charged on their respective borrowings. We do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate a portion of the risk from such exposures. 
    
  Equity Price Risk 
    
  HC2 is exposed to market risk primarily through changes in fair value of available for sale fixed maturity and equity securities. HC2 follows an investment strategy approved by its board of directors which sets certain restrictions on the amounts of securities it may acquire and its overall investment strategy. 
    
  Market prices for fixed maturity and equity securities are subject to fluctuation and consequently the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions. Because HC2 s fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available for-sale, the hypothetical decline would not affect current earnings except to the extent that the decline reflects other-than-temporary impairments.  
    
  A means of assessing exposure to changes in market prices is to estimate the potential changes in market values on the fixed maturity and equity securities resulting from a hypothetical decline in equity market prices. As of   September 30, 2016  , assuming all other factors are constant, we estimate that a   10.0%  ,   20.0%  , and   30.0%   decline in equity market prices would have an   $138.8 million  ,   $277.6 million  , and   $416.5 million   adverse impact on HC2 s portfolio of fixed maturity and equity securities, respectively.  
    
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk 
    
  GMSL and ICS are exposed to market risk from foreign currency price changes which could have a significant and potentially adverse impact on gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries into USD.  
    
  We translate the local currency statements of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into USD using the average exchange rate during the reporting period. Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the reported profits and losses and cash flows of our international subsidiaries and may distort comparisons from year to year. For example, when the USD strengthens compared to the GBP, there could be a negative or positive effect on the reported results for our Telecommunications segment, depending upon whether such businesses are operating profitably or at a loss.  More profits in GBP are required to generate the same amount of profits in USD and, similarly, a greater loss in GBP is required to generate the same amount of loss in USD, and vice versa. For instance, when the USD weakens against the GBP, there is a positive effect on reported profits and a negative effect on reported losses. 

69 

Interest Rate Risk 
    
  GMSL, DBM Global and ANG are exposed to the market risk from changes in interest rates through their borrowings, which bear variable rates based on LIBOR. Changes in LIBOR could result in an increase or decrease in interest expense recorded. A 100, 200, and 300 basis point increase in LIBOR based on the borrowings outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   of   37.4 million  , would result in an increase in the recorded interest expense of   $0.4 million  ,   $0.7 million  , and   $1.1 million   per year.  
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  DBM Global is exposed to the market risk from changes in prices on steel. For large orders the risk is mitigated by locking the general contractors into the price at the mill at the time work is awarded. In the event of a subsequent price increase by the mill, DBM Global has the ability to pass the higher costs on to the general contractor.  DBM Global does not hedge or enter into any forward purchasing arrangements with the mills. The price negotiated at the time of the order is the price paid by DBM Global.  

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
    
  Our management evaluated, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective. Disclosure controls and procedures mean our controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in our reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control. 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 
  
   70 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  The Company is subject to claims and legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Such matters are inherently uncertain, and there can be no guarantee that the outcome of any such matter will be decided favorably to the Company or that the resolution of any such matter will not have a material adverse effect upon the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company does not believe that any of such pending claims and legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company records a liability in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for these matters when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company reviews these estimates each accounting period as additional information is known and adjusts the loss provision when appropriate. If a matter is both probable to result in a liability and the amounts of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company estimates and discloses the possible loss or range of loss to the extent necessary for the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements not to be misleading. If the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recorded in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies to our unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  Telecommunications 
    
  ICS makes purchases from its suppliers, who may rely on the ability to obtain credit insurance on ICS in determining whether or not to extend short-term credit to ICS in the form of accounts receivables. To the extent that these suppliers are unable to obtain such insurance they may be unwilling to extend credit. Recently, two significant insurers of credit, Euler and Coface, have determined that they will not insure ICS credit and that the existing policies on its credit were cancelled based on their analysis of the financial condition of HC2, including its indebtedness levels and recent net losses and negative cash flow. As a result, we expect ICS s suppliers to find it difficult to obtain credit insurance on ICS, which could have a material adverse effect on ICS s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
    
  The United Kingdom s impending departure from the European Union could adversely affect us. 
    
  The United Kingdom held a referendum on June 23, 2016 in which a majority of voters voted to exit the European Union ( Brexit ). Negotiations are expected to commence to determine the future terms of the United Kingdom s relationship with the European Union, including, among other things, the terms of trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The Company s Marine Services and Telecommunications segments operate in the United Kingdom. The Marine Services and Telecommunications segments contributed 9.3% and 9.5% and 15.3% and 18.3% of our net revenues from operations in the United Kingdom for the three and the nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The effects of Brexit will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to European Union markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Brexit could adversely affect European and worldwide economic and market conditions and could contribute to instability in global financial and foreign exchange markets, including volatility in the value of the Euro. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the United Kingdom determines which European Union laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 
    
  There are no additional material changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.

Item 5. Other Information 
    
  On November 3, 2016, HC2 s Board approved a revised form of indemnification agreement for directors and executive officers (the "  Indemnification Agreement  "). The Board determined that, in order to attract and retain highly competent individuals to serve, or continue to serve, as directors and executive officers, it is in the best interests of HC2 and its stockholders to enter into the Indemnification Agreements so as to eliminate any undue concern that such persons will not be indemnified for losses incurred by them relating to their status as a director or executive officer of HC2. HC2 anticipates that it will enter into a substantially similar Indemnification Agreement with any new directors or executive officers. 
    
  The Indemnification Agreements, among other things, require HC2 to indemnify, and advance expenses to, each director and executive officer to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware, including indemnification of expenses such as attorneys' fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by the director or executive officer in any action or proceeding, including any action or proceeding by or in right of HC2, arising out of such person's services as a director or executive officer.  Upon execution of the Indemnification Agreement by any director or officer, any prior indemnification agreements entered into by such person shall be terminated and of no further force or effect. 
    
  The foregoing description of the Indemnification Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the form of Indemnification Agreement, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated by reference herein.

Exhibit 

EXHIBIT 10.1 

INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT  
  This Indemnification Agreement, dated as of this _____ day of ___________ (this    Agreement   ), is made by and between HC2 Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the    Company   ), and _________________ (   Indemnitee   ).  
  RECITALS: 
  A.    Section 141 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (   DGCL   ) provides that the business and affairs of a corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of its board of directors.  
  B.    By virtue of the managerial prerogatives vested in the directors of a Delaware corporation, directors act as fiduciaries of the corporation and its stockholders.  
  C.    It is critically important to the Company and its stockholders that the Company be able to attract and retain the most capable persons reasonably available to serve as directors and named executive officers (   NEOs   ) of the Company. 
  D.    In recognition of the need for corporations to be able to induce capable and responsible persons to accept positions in corporate management, Delaware law authorizes (and in some instances requires) corporations to indemnify their directors and officers, and further authorizes corporations to purchase and maintain insurance for the benefit of their directors and officers.  
  E.    The Delaware courts have recognized that indemnification by a corporation serves the dual policies of (1) allowing corporate officials to resist unjustified lawsuits, secure in the knowledge that, if vindicated, the corporation will bear the expense of litigation, and (2) encouraging capable persons to serve as corporate directors and officers, secure in the knowledge that the corporation will absorb the costs of defending their honesty and integrity.  
  F.    Under Delaware law, a director s or officer s right to be reimbursed for the costs of defense of criminal actions, whether such claims are asserted under state or federal law, does not depend upon the merits of the claims asserted against the director or officer and is separate and distinct from any right to indemnification the director or officer may be able to establish.  
  G.    Indemnitee is, or will be, a director or NEO of the Company and his or her willingness to serve in such capacity is predicated, in substantial part, upon the Company s willingness to indemnify him or her in accordance with the principles reflected above, to the fullest extent permitted by the laws of the State of Delaware, and upon the other undertakings set forth in this Agreement.  
  H.    Therefore, in recognition of the need to provide Indemnitee with substantial protection against personal liability, in order to procure Indemnitee s continued service as a director or officer of the Company and to enhance Indemnitee s ability to serve the Company in an effective manner, and in order to provide such protection pursuant to express contract rights (intended to be enforceable irrespective of, among other things, any amendment to the Company s certificate of incorporation or bylaws (collectively, the    Constituent Documents   ), any change in the composition of the Company s Board of Directors (the    Board   ) or any change-in-control or business combination transaction relating to the Company), the Company wishes to provide in this Agreement for the indemnification of and the advancement of Expenses to Indemnitee as set forth in this Agreement and for the continued coverage of Indemnitee under the Company s directors  and officers  liability insurance policies.    
  I.    In light of the considerations referred to in the preceding recitals, it is the Company s intention and desire that the provisions of this Agreement be construed liberally, subject to their express terms, to maximize the protections to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder.  
  
   1 

AGREEMENT: 
  NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereby agree as follows:  
  1.      Certain Definitions  . In addition to terms defined elsewhere herein, the following terms have the following meanings when used in this Agreement with initial capital letters:  
  (a)       Change in Control    shall have occurred at such time, if any, as Incumbent Directors cease for any reason to constitute a majority of Directors. For purpose of this Section 1(a),    Incumbent Directors    means the individuals who, as of the date hereof, are Directors of the Company and any individual becoming a Director subsequent to the date hereof whose election, nomination for election by the Company s stockholders, or appointment, was approved by a vote of at least two-thirds of the then Incumbent Directors (either by a specific vote or by approval of the proxy statement of the Company in which such person is named as a nominee for director, without objection to such nomination); provided, however, that an individual shall not be an Incumbent Director if such individual s election or appointment to the Board occurs as a result of an actual or threatened election contest (as described in Rule 14a-12(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) with respect to the election or removal of Directors or other actual or threatened solicitation of proxies or consents by or on behalf of a Person other than the Board.  
  (b)       Claim    means (i) any threatened, asserted, pending or completed claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, investigative or other, and whether made pursuant to federal, state or other law; and (ii) any inquiry or investigation, whether made, instituted or conducted, by the Company or any other Person, including without limitation any federal, state or other governmental entity, that Indemnitee determines might lead to the institution of any such claim, demand, action, suit or proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company intends indemnity to be provided hereunder in respect of acts or failure to act prior to, on or after the date hereof.  
  (c)        Controlled Affiliate    means any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity or enterprise, whether or not for profit, that is directly or indirectly controlled by the Company. For purposes of this definition,    control    means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management or policies of an entity or enterprise, whether through the ownership of voting securities, through other voting rights, by contract or otherwise; provided that direct or indirect beneficial ownership of capital stock or other interests in an entity or enterprise entitling the holder to cast 15% or more of the total number of votes generally entitled to be cast in the election of directors (or persons performing comparable functions) of such entity or enterprise shall be deemed to constitute control for purposes of this definition.    
  (d)        Disinterested Director    means a director of the Company who is not and was not a party to the Claim in respect of which indemnification is sought by Indemnitee.  
  (e)        Expenses    means attorneys  and experts  fees and expenses and all other costs and expenses paid or payable in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in (including on appeal), any Claim.  
  (f)        Indemnifiable Claim    means any Claim based upon, arising out of or resulting from (i) any actual, alleged or suspected act or failure to act by Indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or as a director, officer, employee, member, manager, trustee or agent of any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity or enterprise, whether or not for profit, as to which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company, (ii) any actual, alleged or suspected act or failure to act by Indemnitee in respect of any business, transaction, communication, filing, disclosure or other activity of the Company or any other entity or enterprise referred to in clause (i) of this sentence, or (iii) Indemnitee s status as a current or former director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or as a current or former director, officer, employee, member, manager, trustee or  
  
   2 

agent of the Company or any other entity or enterprise referred to in clause (i) of this sentence or any actual, alleged or suspected act or failure to act by Indemnitee in connection with any obligation or restriction imposed upon Indemnitee by reason of such status. In addition to any service at the actual request of the Company, for purposes of this Agreement, Indemnitee shall be deemed to be serving or to have served at the request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, member, manager, agent, trustee or other fiduciary of another entity or enterprise if Indemnitee is or was serving as a director, officer, employee, member, manager, agent, trustee or other fiduciary of such entity or enterprise and (A) such entity or enterprise is or at the time of such service was a Controlled Affiliate, (B) such entity or enterprise is or at the time of such service was an employee benefit plan (or related trust) sponsored or maintained by the Company or a Controlled Affiliate, or (C) the Company or a Controlled Affiliate (by action of the Board, any committee thereof or the Company s Chief Executive Officer (   CEO   ) (other than as the CEO him or herself)) caused or authorized Indemnitee to be nominated, elected, appointed, designated, employed, engaged or selected to serve in such capacity.  
  (g)        Indemnifiable Losses    means any and all Losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from any Indemnifiable Claim; provided, however, that Indemnifiable Losses shall not include Losses incurred by Indemnitee in respect of any Indemnifiable Claim (or any matter or issue therein) as to which Indemnitee shall have been adjudged liable to the Company, unless and only to the extent that the Delaware Court of Chancery or the court in which such Indemnifiable Claim was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, Indemnitee is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification for such Expenses as the court shall deem proper.  
  (h)        Independent Counsel    means a law firm, or a member of a law firm, that is experienced in matters of corporation law and neither presently is, nor in the past five years has been, retained to represent: (i) the Company (or any subsidiary of the Company) or Indemnitee in any matter material to either such party (other than with respect to matters concerning the Indemnitee under this Agreement, or of other indemnitees under similar indemnification agreements) or (ii) any other named (or, as to a threatened matter, reasonably likely to be named) party to the Indemnifiable Claim giving rise to a claim for indemnification hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term  Independent Counsel  shall not include any person who, under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, would have a conflict of interest in representing either the Company or Indemnitee in an action to determine Indemnitee s rights under this Agreement.    
  (i)        Losses    means any and all Expenses, damages, losses, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties (whether civil, criminal or other) and amounts paid or payable in settlement, including without limitation all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any of the foregoing.  
  (j)        Person    means any individual, entity, or group, within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) or 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  
  (k)        Standard of Conduct    means the standard for conduct by Indemnitee that is a condition precedent to indemnification of Indemnitee hereunder against Indemnifiable Losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from an Indemnifiable Claim. The Standard of Conduct is (i) good faith and reasonable belief by Indemnitee that his or her action was in or not opposed to the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, that Indemnitee had no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was unlawful, or (ii) any other applicable standard of conduct that may hereafter be substituted under Section 145(a) or (b) of the DGCL or any successor to such provision(s).  
  2.       Indemnification Obligation  . Subject only to Section 7 and to the proviso in this Section, the Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Indemnitee, to the fullest extent permitted or required by the laws of the State of Delaware in effect on the date hereof or as such laws may from time to time  
  
   3 

hereafter be amended to increase the scope of such permitted indemnification, against any and all Indemnifiable Claims and Indemnifiable Losses; provided, however, that, except as provided in Sections 4 and 20, Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Agreement in connection with any Claim initiated by Indemnitee against the Company or any director or officer of the Company unless the Company has joined in or consented to the initiation of such Claim. The Company acknowledges that the foregoing obligation may be broader than that now provided by applicable law and the Company s Constituent Documents and intends that it be interpreted consistently with this Section and the recitals to this Agreement.  
  3.       Advancement of Expenses  . Indemnitee shall have the right to advancement by the Company prior to the final disposition of any Indemnifiable Claim of any and all Expenses relating to, arising out of or resulting from any Indemnifiable Claim paid or incurred by Indemnitee or which Indemnitee determines in good faith are reasonably likely to be paid or incurred by Indemnitee and as to which Indemnitee s counsel provides supporting documentation. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, Indemnitee s right to such advancement is not subject to the satisfaction of any Standard of Conduct. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, within five business days after any request by Indemnitee that is accompanied by supporting documentation for specific Expenses to be reimbursed or advanced, the Company shall, in accordance with such request (but without duplication), (a) pay such Expenses on behalf of Indemnitee, (b) advance to Indemnitee funds in an amount sufficient to pay such Expenses, or (c) reimburse Indemnitee for such Expenses; provided that Indemnitee shall repay, without interest any amounts actually advanced to Indemnitee that, at the final disposition of the Indemnifiable Claim to which the advance related, were in excess of amounts paid or payable by Indemnitee in respect of Expenses relating to, arising out of or resulting from such Indemnifiable Claim. In connection with any such payment, advancement or reimbursement, at the request of the Company, Indemnitee shall execute and deliver to the Company an undertaking, which need not be secured and shall be accepted without reference to Indemnitee s ability to repay the Expenses, by or on behalf of the Indemnitee, to repay any amounts paid, advanced or reimbursed by the Company in respect of Expenses relating to, arising out of or resulting from any Indemnifiable Claim in respect of which it shall have been determined, following the final disposition of such Indemnifiable Claim and in accordance with Section 7, that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification hereunder.    
  4.       Indemnification for Additional Expenses  . Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee against and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall reimburse Indemnitee for, or advance to Indemnitee, within five business days of such request accompanied by supporting documentation for specific Expenses to be reimbursed or advanced, any and all Expenses paid or incurred by Indemnitee or which Indemnitee determines in good faith are reasonably likely to be paid or incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Claim made, instituted or conducted by Indemnitee for (a) indemnification or reimbursement or advance payment of Expenses by the Company under any provision of this Agreement, or under any other agreement or provision of the Constituent Documents now or hereafter in effect relating to Indemnifiable Claims, and/or (b) recovery under any directors  and officers  liability insurance policies maintained by the Company, regardless in each case of whether Indemnitee ultimately is determined to be entitled to such indemnification, reimbursement, advance or insurance recovery, as the case may be; provided, however, that Indemnitee shall return, without interest, any such advance of Expenses (or portion thereof) which remains unspent at the final disposition of the Claim to which the advance related.  
  5.       Partial Indemnity  . If Indemnitee is entitled under any provision of this Agreement to indemnification by the Company for some or a portion of any Indemnifiable Loss but not for all of the total amount thereof, the Company shall nevertheless indemnify Indemnitee for the portion thereof to which Indemnitee is entitled.  
  
   4 

6.       Procedure for Notification  . To obtain indemnification under this Agreement in respect of an Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss, Indemnitee shall submit to the Company a written request therefor, including a brief description (based upon information then available to Indemnitee) of such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss. If, at the time of the receipt of such request, the Company has directors  and officers  liability insurance in effect under which coverage for such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss is potentially available, the Company shall give prompt written notice of such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss to the applicable insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable policies. The Company shall provide to Indemnitee a copy of such notice delivered to the applicable insurers and, upon Indemnitee s request, copies of all subsequent correspondence between the Company and such insurers regarding the Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss, in each case substantially concurrently with the delivery thereof by the Company. The failure by Indemnitee to timely notify the Company of any Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss shall not relieve the Company from any liability hereunder unless, and only to the extent that, the Company did not otherwise learn of such Indemnifiable Claim or Indemnifiable Loss and such failure results in forfeiture by the Company of substantial defenses, rights or insurance coverage.    
  7.       Determination of Right to Indemnification  .  
  (a)     To the extent that Indemnitee shall have been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Indemnifiable Claim or any portion thereof or in defense of any issue or matter therein, including without limitation dismissal without prejudice, Indemnitee shall be indemnified against all Indemnifiable Losses relating to, arising out of or resulting from such Indemnifiable Claim in accordance with Section 2 and no Standard of Conduct Determination (as defined in Section 7(b)) shall be required.  
  (b)     To the extent that the provisions of Section 7(a) are inapplicable to an Indemnifiable Claim that shall have been finally disposed of, any determination of whether Indemnitee has satisfied the applicable Standard of Conduct (a    Standard of Conduct Determination   ) shall be made as follows: (i) if a Change in Control shall not have occurred, or if a Change in Control shall have occurred but Indemnitee shall have requested that the Standard of Conduct Determination be made pursuant to this clause (i), (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even if less than a quorum of the Board, (B) if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by a majority vote of a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of all Disinterested Directors, or (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors, or if a majority of the Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion addressed to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; and (ii) if a Change in Control shall have occurred and Indemnitee shall not have requested that the Standard of Conduct Determination be made pursuant to clause (i), by Independent Counsel in a written opinion addressed to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee. Indemnitee shall cooperate with reasonable requests of the individual or firm making such Standard of Conduct Determination, including providing to such Person documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination without incurring any unreimbursed cost in connection therewith. The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee against and, if requested by Indemnitee, shall reimburse Indemnitee for, or advance to Indemnitee, within five business days of such request accompanied by supporting documentation for specific costs and expenses to be reimbursed or advanced, any and all costs and expenses (including attorneys  and experts  fees and expenses) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the Person making such Standard of Conduct Determination.  
  (c)     The Company shall use its reasonable efforts to cause any Standard of Conduct Determination required under Section 7(b) to be made as promptly as practicable. If (i) the Person empowered or selected under Section 7 to make the Standard of Conduct Determination shall not have made a determination within 30 calendar days after the later of (A) receipt by the Company of written notice from Indemnitee advising the Company of the final disposition of the applicable Indemnifiable Claim (the date  
  
   5 

of such receipt being the    Notification Date   ) and (B) the selection of an Independent Counsel, if such determination is to be made by Independent Counsel, that is permitted under the provisions of Section 7(e) to make such determination, and (ii) Indemnitee shall have fulfilled his or her obligations set forth in the second sentence of Section 7(b), then Indemnitee shall be deemed to have satisfied the applicable Standard of Conduct; provided that such 30-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 30 calendar days, if the Person making such determination in good faith requires such additional time for the obtaining or evaluation or documentation and/or information relating thereto.    
  (d)     If (i) Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder against any Indemnifiable Losses pursuant to Section 7(a), (ii) no determination of whether Indemnitee has satisfied any applicable standard of conduct under Delaware law is a legally required condition precedent to indemnification of Indemnitee hereunder against any Indemnifiable Losses, or (iii) Indemnitee has been determined or deemed pursuant to Section 7(b) or (c) to have satisfied the applicable Standard of Conduct, then the Company shall pay to Indemnitee, within five business days after the later of (x) the Notification Date in respect of the Indemnifiable Claim or portion thereof to which such Indemnifiable Losses are related, out of which such Indemnifiable Losses arose or from which such Indemnifiable Losses resulted and (y) the earliest date on which the applicable criterion specified in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above shall have been satisfied, an amount equal to the amount of such Indemnifiable Losses. Nothing herein is intended to mean or imply that the Company is intending to use Section 145(f) of the DGCL to dispense with a requirement that Indemnitee meet the applicable Standard of Conduct where it is otherwise required by such statute.  
  (e)     If a Standard of Conduct Determination is required to be, but has not been, made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 7(b)(i), the Independent Counsel shall be selected by the Board or a Board Committee, and the Company shall give written notice to Indemnitee advising him or her of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. If a Standard of Conduct Determination is required to be, or to have been, made by Independent Counsel pursuant to Section 7(b)(ii), the Independent Counsel shall be selected by Indemnitee, and Indemnitee shall give written notice to the Company advising it of the identity of the Independent Counsel so selected. In either case, Indemnitee or the Company, as applicable, may, within five business days after receiving written notice of selection from the other, deliver to the other a written objection to such selection; provided, however, that such objection may be asserted only on the ground that the Independent Counsel so selected does not satisfy the criteria set forth in the definition of  Independent Counsel  in Section 1(h), and the objection shall set forth with particularity the factual basis of such assertion. Absent a proper and timely objection, the Person so selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is properly and timely made and substantiated, (i) the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court has determined that such objection is without merit and (ii) the non-objecting party may, at its option, select an alternative Independent Counsel and give written notice to the other party advising such other party of the identity of the alternative Independent Counsel so selected, in which case the provisions of the two immediately preceding sentences and clause (i) of this sentence shall apply to such subsequent selection and notice. If applicable, the provisions of clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall apply to successive alternative selections. If no Independent Counsel that is permitted under the foregoing provisions of this Section 7(e) to make the Standard of Conduct Determination shall have been selected within 30 calendar days after the Company gives its initial notice pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7(e) or Indemnitee gives its initial notice pursuant to the second sentence of this Section 7(e), as the case may be, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other s selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person or firm selected by the Court or by such other person as the Court shall designate, and the person or firm with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person or firm so appointed will act as Independent Counsel. In all events,  
  
   6 

the Company shall pay all of the actual and reasonable fees and expenses of the Independent Counsel incurred in connection with the Independent Counsel s determination pursuant to Section 7(b).    
  8.       Presumption of Entitlement  . Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, in making any Standard of Conduct Determination, the Person making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee has satisfied the applicable Standard of Conduct, and the Company may overcome such presumption only by its adducing clear and convincing evidence to the contrary. Any Standard of Conduct Determination that is adverse to Indemnitee may be challenged by the Indemnitee in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. No determination by the Company (including by its directors or any Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not satisfied any applicable Standard of Conduct shall be a defense to any Claim by Indemnitee for indemnification or reimbursement or advance payment of Expenses by the Company hereunder or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met any applicable Standard of Conduct.  
  9.       No Other Presumption  . For purposes of this Agreement, the termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement (whether with or without court approval) or conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, will not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any applicable Standard of Conduct or that indemnification hereunder is otherwise not permitted.  
  10.       Non Exclusivity  . The rights of Indemnitee hereunder will be in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Constituent Documents, or the substantive laws of the Company s jurisdiction of incorporation, any other contract or otherwise (collectively,    Other Indemnity Provisions    provided, however, that (a) to the extent that Indemnitee otherwise would have any greater right to indemnification under any Other Indemnity Provision, Indemnitee will without further action be deemed to have such greater right hereunder, and (b) to the extent that any change is made to any Other Indemnity Provision which permits any greater right to indemnification than that provided under this Agreement as of the date hereof, Indemnitee will be deemed to have such greater right hereunder. The Company may not, without the consent of Indemnitee, adopt any amendment to any of the Constituent Documents the effect of which would be to deny, diminish or encumber Indemnitee s right to indemnification under this Agreement or any Other Indemnity Provision.  
  11.      Liability Insurance and Funding  . For the duration of Indemnitee s service as a director and/or officer of the Company and for not less than six years thereafter, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account the scope and amount of coverage available relative to the cost thereof) to cause to be maintained in effect policies of directors  and officers  liability insurance providing coverage for Indemnitee that is at least as favorable in scope and amount to that provided by the Company s current policies of directors  and officers  liability insurance. Upon request, the Company shall provide Indemnitee or his or her counsel with a copy of all directors  and officers  liability insurance applications, binders, policies, declarations, endorsements and other related materials. In all policies of directors  and officers  liability insurance obtained by the Company, Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits, subject to the same limitations, as are accorded to the Company s directors and officers most favorably insured by such policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the Company may, but shall not be required to, create a trust fund, grant a security interest or use other means, including without limitation a letter of credit, to ensure the payment of such amounts as may be necessary to satisfy its obligations to indemnify and advance expenses pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) in renewing or seeking to renew any insurance hereunder, the Company will not be required to expend more than 3.0 times the premium amount of the immediately preceding policy period (equitably adjusted if necessary to reflect differences in policy periods).  
  12.       Subrogation  . In the event of payment under this Agreement, the Company shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all of the related rights of recovery of Indemnitee against other Persons (other than Indemnitee s successors), including any entity or enterprise referred to in clause (i) of the definition of  Indemnifiable Claim  in Section 1(f). Indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required to evidence  
  
   7 

such rights (all of Indemnitee s reasonable Expenses, including attorneys  fees and charges, related thereto to be reimbursed by or, at the option of Indemnitee, advanced by the Company).  
  13.       No Duplication of Payments  . The Company shall not be liable under this Agreement to make any payment to Indemnitee in respect of any Indemnifiable Losses to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise already actually received payment (net of Expenses incurred in connection therewith) under any insurance policy, the Constituent Documents and Other Indemnity Provisions or otherwise (including from any entity or enterprise referred to in clause (i) of the definition of  Indemnifiable Claim  in Section 1(f)) in respect of such Indemnifiable Losses otherwise indemnifiable hereunder.  
  14.       Defense of Claims  . Subject to the provisions of applicable policies of directors  and officers  liability insurance, the Company shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any Indemnifiable Claim or to assume or lead the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee; provided that if Indemnitee determines, after consultation with counsel selected by Indemnitee, that (a) the use of counsel chosen by the Company to represent Indemnitee would present such counsel with an actual or potential conflict, (b) the named parties in any such Indemnifiable Claim (including any impleaded parties) include both the Company and Indemnitee and Indemnitee shall conclude that there may be one or more legal defenses available to him or her that are different from or in addition to those available to the Company, (c) any such representation by such counsel would be precluded under the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing, or (d) Indemnitee has interests in the claim or underlying subject matter that are different from or in addition to those of other Persons against whom the Claim has been made or might reasonably be expected to be made, then Indemnitee shall be entitled to retain separate counsel (but not more than one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel in respect of any particular Indemnifiable Claim for all indemnitees in Indemnitee s circumstances) at the Company s expense. The Company shall not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for any amounts paid in settlement of any threatened or pending Indemnifiable Claim effected without the Company s prior written consent. The Company shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, effect any settlement of any threatened or pending Indemnifiable Claim which the Indemnitee is or could have been a party unless such settlement solely involves the payment of money and includes a complete and unconditional release of the Indemnitee from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such Indemnifiable Claim. Neither the Company nor Indemnitee shall unreasonably withhold its consent to any proposed settlement; provided that Indemnitee may withhold consent to any settlement that does not provide a complete and unconditional release of Indemnitee.    
  15.       Successors, Binding Agreement and Survival  .  
  (a)     The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company expressly to assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent the Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Company and any successor to the Company, including without limitation any Person acquiring directly or indirectly all or substantially all of the business or assets of the Company whether by purchase, merger, consolidation, reorganization or otherwise (and such successor will thereafter be deemed the    Company    for purposes of this Agreement), but shall not otherwise be assignable or delegable by the Company.  
  (b)     This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Indemnitee s personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, heirs, distributees, legatees and other successors.  
  (c)     This Agreement is personal in nature and neither of the parties hereto shall, without the consent of the other, assign or delegate this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder except as expressly provided in Sections 15(a) and 15(b). Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, Indemnitee s right to receive payments hereunder shall not be assignable, whether by pledge, creation of a security interest or otherwise, other than by a transfer by the Indemnitee s will or by the laws of descent and  
  
   8 

distribution, and, in the event of any attempted assignment or transfer contrary to this Section 15(c), the Company shall have no liability to pay any amount so attempted to be assigned or transferred.  
  (d)     For the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement shall survive and continue even though Indemnitee may have terminated his or her service as a director, officer, employee or agent of the Company or as a director, officer, employee, member, manager, trustee or agent of any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust or other entity or enterprise, whether or not for profit, as to which Indemnitee is or was serving at the request of the Company.  
  16.       Notices  . For all purposes of this Agreement, all communications, including without limitation notices, consents, requests or approvals, required or permitted to be given hereunder must be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when hand delivered or dispatched by electronic facsimile or other electronic transmission (with receipt thereof orally confirmed), or one business day after having been sent for next day delivery by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, addressed to the Company (to the attention of the Secretary of the Company) and to Indemnitee at the applicable address shown on the signature page hereto, or to such other address as any party may have furnished to the other in writing and in accordance herewith, except that notices of changes of address will be effective only upon receipt.  
  17.   Governing Law  . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflict of laws of such State. The Company and Indemnitee each hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware for all purposes in connection with any action or proceeding which arises out of or relates to this Agreement, waive all procedural objections to suit in that jurisdiction, including without limitation objections as to venue or inconvenience, agree that service in any such action may be made by notice given in accordance with Section 16 and also agree that any action instituted under this Agreement shall be brought only in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware.  
  18.       Validity  . If any provision of this Agreement or the application of any provision hereof to any Person or circumstance is held invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal, the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to any other Person or circumstance shall not be affected, and the provision so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal shall be reformed to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to make it enforceable, valid or legal. In the event that any court or other adjudicative body shall decline to reform any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, the parties thereto shall take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate to replace the provision so held to be invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal with one or more alternative provisions that effectuate the purpose and intent of the original provisions of this Agreement as fully as possible without being invalid, unenforceable or otherwise illegal.  
  19.       Miscellaneous  . No provision of this Agreement may be waived, modified or discharged unless such waiver, modification or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by Indemnitee and the Company. No waiver by either party hereto at any time of any breach by the other party hereto or compliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions or conditions at the same or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, expressed or implied with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement.  
  20.       Legal Fees and Expenses  . It is the intent of the Company that Indemnitee not be required to incur legal fees and or other Expenses associated with the interpretation, enforcement or defense of Indemnitee s rights under this Agreement by litigation or otherwise because the cost and expense thereof would substantially detract from the benefits intended to be extended to Indemnitee hereunder. Accordingly,  
  
   9 

without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, if it should reasonably appear to Indemnitee that the Company has failed to comply with any of its obligations under this Agreement or in the event that the Company or any other Person takes or threatens to take any action to declare this Agreement void or unenforceable, or institutes any litigation or other action or proceeding designed to improperly deny, or to improperly recover from, Indemnitee the benefits provided or intended to be provided to Indemnitee hereunder, the Company irrevocably authorizes the Indemnitee from time to time to retain counsel of Indemnitee s choice, at the expense of the Company as hereafter provided, to advise and represent Indemnitee in connection with any such interpretation, enforcement or defense, including without limitation the initiation or defense of any litigation or other legal action, whether by or against the Company or any director, officer, stockholder or other Person affiliated with the Company, in any jurisdiction. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof or respect to whether Indemnitee prevails, in whole or in part, in connection with any of the foregoing, the Company will pay and be solely financially responsible for any and all attorneys  and related fees and expenses actually and reasonably incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any of the foregoing.    
  21.      Certain Interpretive Matters  . Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise requires, (a)  it  or  its  or words of any gender include each other gender, (b) words using the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number, respectively, (c) the terms  hereof,   herein,   hereby  and derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement, (d) the terms  Article,   Section,   Annex  or  Exhibit  refer to the specified Article, Section, Annex or Exhibit of or to this Agreement, (e) the terms  include,   includes  and  including  will be deemed to be followed by the words  without limitation  (whether or not so expressed), and (f) the word  or  is disjunctive but not exclusive.

As used herein,  business day  means any day other than Saturday, Sunday or a United States federal holiday.  
  22.       Entire Agreement  . This Agreement and the Constituent Documents constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Any prior agreements or understandings between the parties hereto with respect to indemnification are hereby terminated and of no further force or effect.

  B.    In consideration of the conversion of the Preferred Stock by the Holder, the Company has agreed to issue Common Stock to the Holder in certain circumstances, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

The Holder agrees, pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Certificate of Designation of Series A-1 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, dated as of September 22, 2014, (as amended from time to time prior to the date hereof, and as in effect as of the date hereof, the    Series A-1 Certificate of Designation   ), that on the Closing Date, it will convert 9,000 shares of the Preferred Stock it holds into Common Stock, such shares of Preferred Stock representing all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock it holds as of the date hereof and immediately before the conversion contemplated by this clause (a) (the    Holder s Shares   ). 
  (b)        Initial Issuance of Common Stock by Company.    In consideration of the conversion referenced in clause (a) above, the Company agrees to issue to Holder on the Closing Date, in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ) under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, 136,149 shares of Common Stock. 
  (c)        Participating Dividend Issuances by Company.   In further consideration of the conversion referenced in clause (a) above, the Company agrees that in the event that the Holder, had it not converted the Holder s Shares pursuant to clause (a) above, would have been entitled to any Participating Dividends (as defined in the Series A-1 Certificate of Designation) payable after the date of this Agreement had the Holder s Shares remained unconverted, then the Company will issue to Holder, on the date such Participating Dividends become payable by the  
  
   1

  (g)        Limitation on Hedging Transactions by Holder.   The Holder agrees that, so long as the provisions of clause (c) or clause (d) above remain applicable, it will not, and will not permit any of its controlled parties or affiliates to, directly or indirectly, enter into any hedging transaction, short position, or similar transaction (i) with respect to the shares of the Company s

EXHIBIT A 
    
  ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 
    
  1.  As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Preferred Conversion Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached, holders of the Company s Common Stock may experience significant dilution. The Company has entered into several agreements which feature anti-dilution adjustments that may be triggered by the issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, including: 
    
  (a)        In connection with the December 2015 acquisition of certain insurance assets by the Company (the    Insurance Acquisition   ),  the Company issued warrants to purchase two million shares (the    Warrant   ) of Common Stock to Great American Financial Resources, Inc. a Delaware corporation (   GAFRI   ), at an exercise price of $7.08 per share (subject to certain adjustments, including for anti-dilution if Common Stock is issued at a price below $7.08) on or after February 3, 2016 until five years after the closing date. As a result of such anti-dilution adjustments,   assuming 814,424 shares of Common Stock are issued in connection with the Agreement (and assuming a fixed share price of $4.54 per share), the issuances pursuant to the Agreement would result in a  n increase of 11,364 shares of Common Stock issuable under the Warrant. 
    
  (b)        The Company s Series A-1 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, the Company s Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the    Series A Preferred Stock   ) and the Company s Series A-2 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the    Series A-2 Preferred Stock    ), contain anti-dilution adjustments providing for the adjustment of their conversion prices in certain issuances, including the issuance of Common Stock below their then current respective conversion prices. The Series A-1 Preferred Stock (other than the Series A-1 Preferred Stock held by the Converting Holder which is being converted on the date of the Voluntary Conversion Agreement), the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series A-2 Preferred Stock is referred to as the    Non-Participating Preferred Stock  .  As a result of such anti-dilution adjustments,   assuming 814,424 shares of Common Stock are issued in connection with the Agreement (and assuming a fixed share price of $4.54 per share), the issuances pursuant to the Agreement     would result   in an increase of 29,423 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Non-Participating Preferred Stock.

No Holder shall deliver an initiating request under this Section 2.1(a) at any time when a Shelf Registration Statement covering such Holder s Registrable Securities is effective and available for use in connection with a resale of such Registrable Securities. The Company shall not be required to file a Form S-1 registration statement under this Section 2.1(a) if it is then eligible to use Form S-3 for secondary offerings of Registrable and it advises the Initiating Holders that it is preparing a Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the first sentence of Section 2.1(b)(i).  
  (b)   Shelf Registration  .  
  (i) Within thirty (30) days after the date on which a Holder of Registrable Securities shall so request (provided, that the Company is, at the time of receipt of such request, eligible to use a Form S-3 registration statement for secondary offerings of Registrable Securities) and for so long as there are Registrable Securities outstanding, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Company shall at all times have and maintain an effective Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration covering the resale of all of the Registrable Securities requested to be included by any Holder, on a delayed or continuous basis (the    Shelf Registration Statement   ). The Company shall give written notice of the filing of any Shelf Registration Statement at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing such Shelf Registration Statement to all Holders of Registrable Securities and shall, upon receipt of a request from any Holder, include in such Shelf Registration Statement all Registrable Securities of each requesting Holder. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the terms hereof. The  Plan of Distribution  section of such Shelf Registration Statement shall permit all lawful means of disposition of Registrable Securities, including firm-commitment underwritten public offerings, block trades, agented transactions, sales directly into the market, purchases or sales by brokers, Hedging Transactions, distributions to stockholders, partners or members of such Holders and sales not involving a public offering.  
  (ii) From and after the date that the Shelf Registration Statement is initially effective, as promptly as is practicable after receipt of a request from a Holder, and in any event within (x) ten (10) days after the date such request is received by the Company or (y) if a request is so received during a Suspension Period, five (5) days after the expiration of such Suspension Period, the Company shall take all necessary action to cause the requesting Holder to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus in such a manner as to permit such Holder to deliver such Prospectus in connection with sales of such Registrable Securities to the  

purchasers thereof in accordance with applicable law, which action may include: (A) if required by applicable law, filing with the Commission a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement; (B) preparing and, if required by applicable law, filing a supplement or supplements to the related Prospectus or a supplement or amendment to any document incorporated therein by reference; (C) filing any other required document; or (D) with respect to a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement that is not automatically effective, using its reasonable best efforts to cause such post-effective amendment to be declared or to otherwise become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as is practicable; provided that: (A) the Company may delay such filing until the date that is twenty (20) days after any prior such filing; (B) if the Shelf Registration Statement is not an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement and the Company has already made such a filing during the calendar quarter in which such filing would otherwise be required to be made, the Company may delay such filing until the tenth (10th) day of the following calendar quarter; and (C) if such request is delivered during a Suspension Period, the Company shall so inform the Holder delivering such request and shall take the actions set forth above upon expiration of the Suspension Period in accordance with   Subsection 2.1(d)  . 
  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing obligations, if the Company furnishes to Holders requesting a registration pursuant to this   Subsection 2.1   a certificate signed by the Company s chief executive officer stating that in the good faith judgment of the Company s Board of Directors, after consultation with counsel, it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such registration statement to either become effective or remain effective for as long as such registration statement otherwise would be required to remain effective, because such action would (i) be expected to have a material adverse effect on any proposal or plan of the Company to effect a merger, acquisition, disposition, financing, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render the Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, then the Company shall have the right to defer taking action with respect to such filing, and any time periods with respect to filing or effectiveness thereof shall be tolled correspondingly, for a period of not more than forty five (45) days after the request of the Initiating Holder is given;   provided  ,   however  , that the Company may not invoke this right more than once in any twelve (12) month period; and   provided     further   that the Company shall not register any securities for its own account or that of any other stockholder during such forty five (45) day period other than an Excluded Registration. 

(d)   Suspension Periods  . Upon written notice to the Holders of Registrable Securities, (x) the Company shall be entitled to suspend, for a period of time, the use of any Registration Statement or Prospectus if the Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with counsel, that the Registration Statement or any Prospectus may contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements in the Registration Statement or Prospectus not misleading and (y) the Company shall not be required to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, any related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference if the Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with counsel, that such amendment or supplement would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on any proposal or plan of the Company to effect a merger, acquisition, disposition, financing, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction, in each case that is material to the Company (in case of each clause (x) and (y), a    Suspension Period    provided that (A) the duration of all Suspension Periods may not exceed one hundred and twenty (120) days in the aggregate in any 12-month period and (B) the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to amend or supplement the Registration Statement and/or Prospectus to correct such untrue statement or omission as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event shall any single suspension period exceed forty five (45) days. 
  (e) The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration pursuant to   Subsection 2.1(a)   during the period ending ninety (90) days after the effective date of, another registration by the Company, including a Company-initiated registration, in each case, in which Holders were entitled to include Registrable Securities in accordance with Section 2.2. A registration shall not be counted as  effected  for purposes of this   Subsection 2.1(e)   until such time as the applicable registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC;   provided  ,   however  , if the Initiating Holders withdraw their request for such registration and elect to pay the  

registration expenses therefor, such withdrawn registration statement shall not be counted as  effected  for purposes of this   Subsection 2.1(e)  .  
  (f)   Secondary Offering  . If at any time the SEC takes the position that the offering of some or all of the Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement are not eligible to be made as a secondary offering, the Company shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to persuade the SEC that the offering contemplated by the Registration Statement is a bona fide secondary offering. In the event that the SEC refuses to alter its position, the Company shall (i) remove from the Registration Statement such portion of the Registrable Securities (the    Cut Back Shares   ) and/or (ii) agree to such restrictions and limitations on the registration and resale of the Registrable Securities as the SEC may require to assure that the Registration Statement is deemed a secondary offering (collectively, the    SEC Restrictions      provided  , however, that the Company shall not agree to name any Holder as an  underwriter  in such Registration Statement without the prior written consent of such Holder. Any cut-back imposed pursuant to this   Section 2.1(f)   shall be allocated among the Holders on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares that such Holders have requested to be included in such Registration Statement, unless the SEC Restrictions otherwise require or provide or the participating Holders otherwise agree. From and after the date that the Company is able to effect the registration of such Cut Back Shares in accordance with any SEC Restrictions, all of the provisions of this   Section 2.1   shall again be applicable to such Cut Back Shares. 

2.2   Company Registration  . If the Company proposes to register (including, for this purpose, a registration effected by the Company for stockholders other than the Holders) any of its Common Stock under the Securities Act in connection with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other than in an Excluded Registration), the Company shall, at such time, promptly give each Holder written notice of such Registration. In the case of a takedown offering under a Shelf Registration, the Company shall give each Holder notice of such registration not less than five (5) days prior to the expected date of commencement of marketing efforts for such takedown. Upon the request of each Holder given within two (2) days after such notice is given by the Company, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of   Subsection 2.3  , cause to be included all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be included in such registration. The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this   Subsection 2.2   before the effective date of such registration, whether or not any Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration. The expenses (other than Selling Expenses) of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with   Subsection 2.6  . 
  2.3   Underwriting Requirements  .  
  (a) If, pursuant to   Subsection 2.1(a)  , the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an Underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to   Subsection 2.1  , and the Company shall include such information in the Demand Notice. The managing Underwriter(s) will be selected by the Initiating Holders, subject only to the reasonable approval of the Company. In such event, the right of any Holder to include such Holder s Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder s participation in such Underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder s Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such Underwriting shall (together with the Company as provided in   Subsection 2.4(n)  ) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwriting. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subsection 2.3, if the managing Underwriter(s) advise the Initiating Holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, then the Initiating Holders (if there are Holders of Registrable Securities other than the Initiating Holders) shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities that otherwise would be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of Registrable Securities that shall be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among such Holders of Registrable Securities, including the Initiating Holders, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the number of Registrable Securities proposed by each Holder to be included in the registration or in such other proportion as shall mutually be agreed to in writing by all such selling Holders; provided, however, that the number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders to be included in such underwriting shall not be reduced unless all other securities to be sold by persons who are not Holders are first entirely excluded from the underwriting. 

(b)   Shelf Underwritten Takedown  .  
  (i) At any time after the Company has an effective shelf registration one or more Holders of outstanding Registrable Securities may request that the Company effect an underwritten takedown under the Shelf Registration Statement of at least $5 million in Registrable Securities, based on the closing market price on the trading day immediately prior to the initial request of such requesting Holders.  Within five (5) days of receipt of such request, the Company shall notify all other Holders (if applicable) whose Registrable Securities are included in such Shelf Registration Statement of such request and shall (except as provided in clause (iii) below) include in such Underwritten Takedown all Registrable Securities requested to be included therein by Holders who respond within five (5) days of the Company s notification described above. 
  (ii) For any Underwritten Takedown from a Shelf Registration Statement, the managing underwriter or underwriters shall be selected by the Holders participating in such offering holding a majority of the Registrable Securities to be disposed of pursuant to such offering and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company.  
  (iii) If the managing underwriter or underwriters for the Underwritten Takedown advise the Company that in their reasonable opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such underwritten offering takedown exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the Initiating Holders, the Company shall include in such Underwritten Takedown the number which can be so sold in the following order of priority: (A) first, the securities requested to be included by the Holders (pro rata among the Holders of such securities on the basis of the number of securities requested to be included therein by each such holder), (B) second, the securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Takedown by holders exercising piggyback registration rights (pro rata among the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of securities requested to be included therein by each such holder), (C) third, the securities the Company proposes to sell, and (D) fourth, other securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Takedown (pro rata among the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of securities requested to be included therein by each such holder).  
  (iv) The Company shall not be required to effect an Underwritten Takedown more than once in any six (6) month period. 
  (c) In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Company s capital stock pursuant to   Subsection 2.2  , the Company shall not be required to include any of the Holders  Registrable Securities in such underwriting unless the Holders accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and its underwriters, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the Company. If the total number of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the number of securities to be sold that the underwriters in their reasonable discretion determine is compatible with the success of the offering, then the Company shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters and the Company in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering. If the underwriters determine that less than all of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered can be included in such offering, then the Registrable Securities that are included in such offering shall be allocated among the selling Holders in proportion (as nearly as practicable to) to the number of Registrable Securities proposed by each Holder to be included in the registration or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to in writing by all such selling Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall (i) the number of Registrable Securities included in the offering be reduced unless all other securities (other than securities to be sold by the Company) are first entirely excluded from the offering. For purposes of the provision in this   Subsection 2.3(c)   and   Sections 2.3(a)   and   2.3(b)(iii)   concerning apportionment, for any selling Holder that is a partnership, limited liability company, or corporation, the partners, members, retired partners, retired members, stockholders, and Affiliates of such Holder, or the estates and Immediate Family Members of any such partners, retired partners, members, and retired members and any trusts for the benefit of any of the foregoing Persons, shall be deemed to be a single  selling Holder,  and any pro rata reduction with respect to such  selling Holder  shall be based upon the aggregate number of Registrable Securities owned by all Persons included in such  selling Holder,  as defined in this sentence. 

(d) For purposes of   Subsection 2.1   and   2.3(b)  , a registration shall not be counted as  effected  if, as a result of an exercise of the underwriter s cutback provisions in   Subsection 2.3(a)  , fewer than seventy-five percent (75%) of the total number of Registrable Securities that Holders have requested to be included in such registration statement are actually included.

The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact, or the omission or alleged omission of a material fact, relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties  relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission;   provided  ,   however  , that, in any such case no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and   provided     further   that in no event shall a Holder s liability pursuant to this   Subsection 2.8(d)  , when combined with the amounts paid or payable by such Holder pursuant to   Subsection 2.8(b)  , exceed the proceeds from the related offering received by such Holder (net of any Selling Expenses paid by such Holder), except in the case of willful misconduct or fraud by such Holder.  
  (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control between the parties to such agreement.

  RECITALS 
    
  A.    The Holder has agreed to convert all of the shares of Preferred Stock it holds into common stock of the Company, par value $0.001 per share (the    Common Stock   ), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
    
  B.    In consideration of the conversion of the Preferred Stock by the Holder, the Company has agreed to issue Common Stock to the Holder in certain circumstances, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
    
  AGREEMENT

  1.  Conversion of the Preferred Stock and Issuances of Common Stock.    On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Company and the Holder agree to take the following actions on the Closing Date (as defined below): 
  (a)        Conversion by the Holder.   The Holder agrees, pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Certificate of Designation of Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, dated as of May 29, 2014, (as amended from time to time prior to the date hereof, and as in effect as of the date hereof, the    Series A     Certificate of Designation   ), that on the Closing Date, it will convert 1,000 shares of the Preferred Stock it holds into Common Stock, such shares of Preferred Stock representing all of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock it holds as of the date hereof and immediately before the conversion contemplated by this clause (a) (the    Holder s Shares   ). 
  (b)        Initial Issuance of Common Stock by Company.    In consideration of the conversion referenced in clause (a) above, the Company agrees to issue to Holder on the Closing Date, in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ) under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, 15,318 shares of Common Stock. 
  (c)        Participating Dividend Issuances by Company.   In further consideration of the conversion referenced in clause (a) above, the Company agrees that in the event that the Holder, had it not converted the Holder s Shares pursuant to clause (a) above, would have been entitled to any Participating Dividends (as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designation) payable after the date of this Agreement had the Holder s Shares remained unconverted, then the Company will issue to Holder, on the date such Participating Dividends become payable by the Company, in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act under Section 4(a)(2)  
  
   1

  (d)        Accrued Value Issuances by Company.   In further consideration of the conversion referenced in clause (a) above, the Company agrees that it will issue to Holder, on each quarterly anniversary of May 29, 2017 (or, if later, the date on which the corresponding dividend payment is made to the holders of the outstanding Preferred Stock) (such period, the    Quarterly Measurement Period   ), through and until the Maturity Date (as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designation), in a transaction exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, the number of shares of Common Stock equal to (a) 1.875% the Accrued Value (as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designation) of the Holder s Shares as of the Closing Date, divided by (b) the Thirty Day VWAP (as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designation) for the period ending two business days prior to the applicable Dividend Payment Date (as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designation). 
  (e)        Cessation of Issuances.   The provisions of clauses (c) and (d) above will cease to apply, and the Company will not be required to issue any additional shares of its Common Stock hereunder, if beginning on May 29, 2017 and at any time thereafter, the Thirty Day VWAP and the Daily VWAP (each as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designation), would be such that the Company would have been able to cause Holder to convert the Holder s Shares pursuant to Section 5(b) of the Series A Certificate of Designation, assuming for purposes of this provision (and the underlying Conversion Price, as defined in the Series A Certificate of Designation) that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (or any similar transaction with holders of Non-Participating Preferred Stock (as defined in   Exhibit A  ) had never taken place.

  (g)        Limitation on Hedging Transactions by Holder.   The Holder agrees that, so long as the provisions of clause (c) or clause (d) above remain applicable, it will not, and will not permit any of its controlled parties or affiliates to, directly or indirectly, enter into any hedging transaction, short position, or similar transaction (i) with respect to the shares of the Company s Common Stock it may have the right to receive pursuant to clauses (c) or (d) hereof until and unless such shares of Common Stock are issued to Holder or (ii) during any Quarterly Measurement Period.

(c)        Accredited Investor.    The Holder is an  accredited investor  as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. 
  (d)        Investment Representations  .  The Holder understands that the private placements of the Shares has not been registered under the Securities Act.  The Holder also understands that the Shares are being issued pursuant to an exemption from registration contained in the Securities Act based in part upon the Holder s representations contained in this Agreement and that the Shares must continue to be held by the Holder unless a subsequent disposition thereof is registered under the Securities Act or is exempt from such registration.

The Holder understands that there is no assurance that any exemption from registration under the Securities Act will be available for the disposition by it of the Shares. 
  (f)        Acquisition for Own Account.

The Holder has no present agreement, undertaking, arrangement, obligation or commitment providing for the disposition of the Shares. 
  (g)        HSR.    The Acquiring Person (as defined in 16 C.F.R.  801.2(a)) qualifies for the  acquisition solely for the purpose of investment exemption  under 16 C.F.R.   802.9, and the Holder s acquisition of the Shares is therefore exempt from the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended.

  (m)        No Governmental Review.

  (a)        The Holder agrees that it and its controlled Affiliates may only dispose of the Shares pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act or pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, and in compliance with any applicable state securities laws. In connection with any transfer of Shares other than pursuant to an effective registration statement or to the Company or pursuant to paragraph  (b)(1) of Rule 144, the Company may require that the transferor provide to the Company an opinion of counsel, selected by the transferor and reasonably acceptable to the Company, the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to the effect that such transfer does not require registration under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company hereby consents to and agrees to register on the books of the Company and with its transfer agent, without any such legal opinion, any transfer of the Shares by the Holder to an Affiliate of the Holder, provided that the transferee certifies to the Company that it is an  accredited investor  as defined in Rule 501(a) under the Securities Act. For purposes of this Agreement, the term    Affiliate    means, with respect to any person, any other person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by or under common control with, such person.

  1.  As a result of the transactions contemplated by the Preferred Conversion Agreement to which this Exhibit A is attached, holders of the Company s Common Stock may experience significant dilution. The Company has entered into several agreements which feature anti-dilution adjustments that may be triggered by the issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities, including: 
    
  (a)        In connection with the December 2015 acquisition of certain insurance assets by the Company (the    Insurance Acquisition   ),  the Company issued warrants to purchase two million shares (the    Warrant   ) of Common Stock to Great American Financial Resources, Inc. a Delaware corporation (   GAFRI   ), at an exercise price of $7.08 per share (subject to certain adjustments, including for anti-dilution if Common Stock is issued at a price below $7.08) on or after February 3, 2016 until five years after the closing date. As a result of such anti-dilution adjustments,   assuming 814,424 shares of Common Stock are issued in connection with the Agreement and   similar transactions being undertaken substantially concurrently with this transaction   (and assuming a fixed share price of $4.54 per share), the issuances pursuant to the Agreement would result in a  n increase of 11,364 shares of Common Stock issuable under the Warrant. 
    
  (b)        The Company s Series A Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, the Company s Series A-1 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the    Series A-1 Preferred Stock   ) and the Company s Series A-2 Convertible Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share (the    Series A-2 Preferred Stock    ), contain anti-dilution adjustments providing for the adjustment of their conversion prices in certain issuances, including the issuance of Common Stock below their then current respective conversion prices. The Series A Preferred Stock (other than the Series A Preferred Stock held by the Converting Holder which is being converted on the date of the Voluntary Conversion Agreement), the Series A-1 Preferred Stock and the Series A-2 Preferred Stock is referred to as the    Non-Participating Preferred Stock  .  As a result of such anti-dilution adjustments,   assuming 814,424 shares of Common Stock are issued in connection with the Agreement and   similar transactions being undertaken substantially concurrently with this transaction   (and assuming a fixed share price of $4.54 per share), the issuances pursuant to the Agreement     would result   in an increase of 29,423 shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Non-Participating Preferred Stock.

No Holder shall deliver an initiating request under this Section 2.1(a) at any time when a Shelf Registration Statement covering such Holder s Registrable Securities is effective and available for use in connection with a resale of such Registrable Securities. The Company shall not be required to file a Form S-1 registration statement under this Section 2.1(a) if it is then eligible to use Form S-3 for secondary offerings of Registrable and it advises the Initiating Holders that it is preparing a Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the first sentence of Section 2.1(b)(i).  
  (b)   Shelf Registration  .  
  (i) Within thirty (30) days after the date on which a Holder of Registrable Securities shall so request (provided, that the Company is, at the time of receipt of such request, eligible to use a Form S-3 registration statement for secondary offerings of Registrable Securities) and for so long as there are Registrable Securities outstanding, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Company shall at all times have and maintain an effective Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration covering the resale of all of the Registrable Securities requested to be included by any Holder, on a delayed or continuous basis (the    Shelf Registration Statement   ). The Company shall give written notice of the filing of any Shelf Registration Statement at least fifteen (15) days prior to filing such Shelf Registration Statement to all Holders of Registrable Securities and shall, upon receipt of a request from any Holder, include in such Shelf Registration Statement all Registrable Securities of each requesting Holder. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the terms hereof. The  Plan of Distribution  section of such Shelf Registration Statement shall permit all lawful means of disposition of Registrable Securities, including firm-commitment underwritten public offerings, block trades, agented transactions, sales directly into the market, purchases or sales by brokers, Hedging Transactions, distributions to stockholders, partners or members of such Holders and sales not involving a public offering.  
  (ii) From and after the date that the Shelf Registration Statement is initially effective, as promptly as is practicable after receipt of a request from a Holder, and in any event within (x) ten (10) days after the date such request is received by the Company or (y) if a request is so received during a Suspension Period, five (5) days after the expiration of such Suspension Period, the Company shall take all necessary action to cause the requesting Holder to be named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus in such a manner as to permit such Holder to deliver such Prospectus in connection with sales of such Registrable Securities to the  

purchasers thereof in accordance with applicable law, which action may include: (A) if required by applicable law, filing with the Commission a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement; (B) preparing and, if required by applicable law, filing a supplement or supplements to the related Prospectus or a supplement or amendment to any document incorporated therein by reference; (C) filing any other required document; or (D) with respect to a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement that is not automatically effective, using its reasonable best efforts to cause such post-effective amendment to be declared or to otherwise become effective under the Securities Act as promptly as is practicable; provided that: (A) the Company may delay such filing until the date that is twenty (20) days after any prior such filing; (B) if the Shelf Registration Statement is not an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement and the Company has already made such a filing during the calendar quarter in which such filing would otherwise be required to be made, the Company may delay such filing until the tenth (10th) day of the following calendar quarter; and (C) if such request is delivered during a Suspension Period, the Company shall so inform the Holder delivering such request and shall take the actions set forth above upon expiration of the Suspension Period in accordance with   Subsection 2.1(d)  . 
  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing obligations, if the Company furnishes to Holders requesting a registration pursuant to this   Subsection 2.1   a certificate signed by the Company s chief executive officer stating that in the good faith judgment of the Company s Board of Directors, after consultation with counsel, it would be materially detrimental to the Company and its stockholders for such registration statement to either become effective or remain effective for as long as such registration statement otherwise would be required to remain effective, because such action would (i) be expected to have a material adverse effect on any proposal or plan of the Company to effect a merger, acquisition, disposition, financing, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction; (ii) require premature disclosure of material information that the Company has a bona fide business purpose for preserving as confidential; or (iii) render the Company unable to comply with requirements under the Securities Act or Exchange Act, then the Company shall have the right to defer taking action with respect to such filing, and any time periods with respect to filing or effectiveness thereof shall be tolled correspondingly, for a period of not more than forty five (45) days after the request of the Initiating Holder is given;   provided  ,   however  , that the Company may not invoke this right more than once in any twelve (12) month period; and   provided     further   that the Company shall not register any securities for its own account or that of any other stockholder during such forty five (45) day period other than an Excluded Registration. 

(d)   Suspension Periods  . Upon written notice to the Holders of Registrable Securities, (x) the Company shall be entitled to suspend, for a period of time, the use of any Registration Statement or Prospectus if the Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with counsel, that the Registration Statement or any Prospectus may contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements in the Registration Statement or Prospectus not misleading and (y) the Company shall not be required to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, any related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference if the Board of Directors determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with counsel, that such amendment or supplement would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on any proposal or plan of the Company to effect a merger, acquisition, disposition, financing, reorganization, recapitalization or similar transaction, in each case that is material to the Company (in case of each clause (x) and (y), a    Suspension Period    provided that (A) the duration of all Suspension Periods may not exceed one hundred and twenty (120) days in the aggregate in any 12-month period and (B) the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to amend or supplement the Registration Statement and/or Prospectus to correct such untrue statement or omission as soon as reasonably practicable, but in no event shall any single suspension period exceed forty five (45) days. 
  (e) The Company shall not be obligated to effect, or to take any action to effect, any registration pursuant to   Subsection 2.1(a)   during the period ending ninety (90) days after the effective date of, another registration by the Company, including a Company-initiated registration, in each case, in which Holders were entitled to include Registrable Securities in accordance with Section 2.2. A registration shall not be counted as  effected  for purposes of this   Subsection 2.1(e)   until such time as the applicable registration statement has been declared effective by the SEC;   provided  ,   however  , if the Initiating Holders withdraw their request for such registration and elect to pay the  

registration expenses therefor, such withdrawn registration statement shall not be counted as  effected  for purposes of this   Subsection 2.1(e)  .  
  (f)   Secondary Offering  . If at any time the SEC takes the position that the offering of some or all of the Registrable Securities in a Registration Statement are not eligible to be made as a secondary offering, the Company shall use commercially reasonable best efforts to persuade the SEC that the offering contemplated by the Registration Statement is a bona fide secondary offering. In the event that the SEC refuses to alter its position, the Company shall (i) remove from the Registration Statement such portion of the Registrable Securities (the    Cut Back Shares   ) and/or (ii) agree to such restrictions and limitations on the registration and resale of the Registrable Securities as the SEC may require to assure that the Registration Statement is deemed a secondary offering (collectively, the    SEC Restrictions      provided  , however, that the Company shall not agree to name any Holder as an  underwriter  in such Registration Statement without the prior written consent of such Holder. Any cut-back imposed pursuant to this   Section 2.1(f)   shall be allocated among the Holders on a pro rata basis in accordance with the number of shares that such Holders have requested to be included in such Registration Statement, unless the SEC Restrictions otherwise require or provide or the participating Holders otherwise agree. From and after the date that the Company is able to effect the registration of such Cut Back Shares in accordance with any SEC Restrictions, all of the provisions of this   Section 2.1   shall again be applicable to such Cut Back Shares. 

2.2   Company Registration  . If the Company proposes to register (including, for this purpose, a registration effected by the Company for stockholders other than the Holders) any of its Common Stock under the Securities Act in connection with the public offering of such securities solely for cash (other than in an Excluded Registration), the Company shall, at such time, promptly give each Holder written notice of such Registration. In the case of a takedown offering under a Shelf Registration, the Company shall give each Holder notice of such registration not less than five (5) days prior to the expected date of commencement of marketing efforts for such takedown. Upon the request of each Holder given within two (2) days after such notice is given by the Company, the Company shall, subject to the provisions of   Subsection 2.3  , cause to be included all of the Registrable Securities that each such Holder has requested to be included in such registration. The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this   Subsection 2.2   before the effective date of such registration, whether or not any Holder has elected to include Registrable Securities in such registration. The expenses (other than Selling Expenses) of such withdrawn registration shall be borne by the Company in accordance with   Subsection 2.6  .  
  2.3   Underwriting Requirements  .  
  (a) If, pursuant to   Subsection 2.1(a)  , the Initiating Holders intend to distribute the Registrable Securities covered by their request by means of an Underwriting, they shall so advise the Company as a part of their request made pursuant to   Subsection 2.1  , and the Company shall include such information in the Demand Notice. The managing Underwriter(s) will be selected by the Initiating Holders, subject only to the reasonable approval of the Company. In such event, the right of any Holder to include such Holder s Registrable Securities in such registration shall be conditioned upon such Holder s participation in such Underwriting and the inclusion of such Holder s Registrable Securities in the underwriting to the extent provided herein. All Holders proposing to distribute their securities through such Underwriting shall (together with the Company as provided in   Subsection 2.4(n)  ) enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form with the Underwriter(s) selected for such Underwriting. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subsection 2.3, if the managing Underwriter(s) advise the Initiating Holders in writing that marketing factors require a limitation on the number of shares to be underwritten, then the Initiating Holders (if there are Holders of Registrable Securities other than the Initiating Holders) shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities that otherwise would be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the number of Registrable Securities that shall be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among such Holders of Registrable Securities, including the Initiating Holders, in proportion (as nearly as practicable) to the number of Registrable Securities proposed by each Holder to be included in the registration or in such other proportion as shall mutually be agreed to in writing by all such selling Holders; provided, however, that the number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders to be included in such underwriting shall not be reduced unless all other securities to be sold by persons who are not Holders are first entirely excluded from the underwriting. 

(b)   Shelf Underwritten Takedown  .  
  (i) At any time after the Company has an effective shelf registration one or more Holders of outstanding Registrable Securities may request that the Company effect an underwritten takedown under the Shelf Registration Statement of at least $5 million in Registrable Securities, based on the closing market price on the trading day immediately prior to the initial request of such requesting Holders.  Within five (5) days of receipt of such request, the Company shall notify all other Holders (if applicable) whose Registrable Securities are included in such Shelf Registration Statement of such request and shall (except as provided in clause (iii) below) include in such Underwritten Takedown all Registrable Securities requested to be included therein by Holders who respond within five (5) days of the Company s notification described above. 
  (ii) For any Underwritten Takedown from a Shelf Registration Statement, the managing underwriter or underwriters shall be selected by the Holders participating in such offering holding a majority of the Registrable Securities to be disposed of pursuant to such offering and shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company.  
  (iii) If the managing underwriter or underwriters for the Underwritten Takedown advise the Company that in their reasonable opinion the number of securities requested to be included in such underwritten offering takedown exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such offering within a price range acceptable to the Initiating Holders, the Company shall include in such Underwritten Takedown the number which can be so sold in the following order of priority: (A) first, the securities requested to be included by the Holders (pro rata among the Holders of such securities on the basis of the number of securities requested to be included therein by each such holder), (B) second, the securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Takedown by holders exercising piggyback registration rights (pro rata among the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of securities requested to be included therein by each such holder), (C) third, the securities the Company proposes to sell, and (D) fourth, other securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Takedown (pro rata among the holders of such securities on the basis of the number of securities requested to be included therein by each such holder).  
  (iv) The Company shall not be required to effect an Underwritten Takedown more than once in any six (6) month period. 
  (c) In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of the Company s capital stock pursuant to   Subsection 2.2  , the Company shall not be required to include any of the Holders  Registrable Securities in such underwriting unless the Holders accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between the Company and its underwriters, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering by the Company. If the total number of securities, including Registrable Securities, requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the number of securities to be sold that the underwriters in their reasonable discretion determine is compatible with the success of the offering, then the Company shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such securities, including Registrable Securities, which the underwriters and the Company in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering. If the underwriters determine that less than all of the Registrable Securities requested to be registered can be included in such offering, then the Registrable Securities that are included in such offering shall be allocated among the selling Holders in proportion (as nearly as practicable to) to the number of Registrable Securities proposed by each Holder to be included in the registration or in such other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to in writing by all such selling Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall (i) the number of Registrable Securities included in the offering be reduced unless all other securities (other than securities to be sold by the Company) are first entirely excluded from the offering.

  (a) To the extent permitted by law, the Company will indemnify and hold harmless each selling Holder, and the partners, members, officers, directors, and stockholders of each such Holder; legal counsel and accountants for each such Holder; any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for each such Holder; and each Person, if any, who controls such Holder or underwriter within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any Damages, and the Company will pay to each such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating or defending any claim or proceeding from which Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred;   provided  ,   however  , that the indemnity agreement contained in this   Subsection 2.8(a)   shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, nor shall the Company be liable for any Damages to the extent that they arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of any such Holder, underwriter, controlling Person, or other aforementioned Person expressly for use in connection with such registration.  
    
  (b) To the extent permitted by law, each selling Holder, severally and not jointly, will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, and each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed the Registration Statement, each Person (if any), who controls the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act, legal counsel and accountants for the Company, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act), any other Holder selling securities in such registration statement, and any controlling Person of any such underwriter or other Holder, against any Damages, in each case only to the extent that such Damages arise out of or are based upon actions or omissions made in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of such selling Holder expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such selling Holder will pay to the Company and each other aforementioned Person any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred thereby in connection with investigating or defending any claim or proceeding from which Damages may result, as such expenses are incurred;   provided  ,   however  , that the indemnity agreement contained in this   Subsection 2.8(b)   shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim or proceeding if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Holder, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and   provided     further   that in no event shall the aggregate amounts payable by any Holder by way of indemnity or contribution under   Subsections 2.8(b)   and   2.8(d)   exceed the proceeds from the related offering received by such Holder (net of any Selling Expenses paid by such Holder).  
  (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this   Subsection 2.8   of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action) for which a party may be entitled to indemnification hereunder, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this   Subsection 2.8  , give the indemnifying party notice of the commencement thereof. The indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in such action and, to the extent the indemnifying party so desires, participate jointly with any other indemnifying party to which notice has been given, and to assume the defense thereof with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties;   provided  ,   however  , that an indemnified party (together with all other indemnified parties that may be represented without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such action.  
  (d) To provide for just and equitable contribution to joint liability under the Securities Act in any case in which either: (i) any party otherwise entitled to indemnification hereunder makes a claim for indemnification pursuant to this   Subsection 2.8   but it is judicially determined (by the entry of a final judgment or decree by a court of competent  

jurisdiction and the expiration of time to appeal or the denial of the last right of appeal) that such indemnification may not be enforced in such case, notwithstanding the fact that this   Subsection 2.8   provides for indemnification in such case, or (ii) contribution under the Securities Act may be required on the part of any party hereto for which indemnification is provided under this   Subsection 2.8  , then, and in each such case, such parties will contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages, liabilities, or expenses to which they may be subject (after contribution from others) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of each of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the statements, omissions, or other actions that resulted in such loss, claim, damage, liability, or expense, as well as to reflect any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of the indemnifying party and of the indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or allegedly untrue statement of a material fact, or the omission or alleged omission of a material fact, relates to information supplied by the indemnifying party or by the indemnified party and the parties  relative intent, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission;   provided  ,   however  , that, in any such case no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation; and   provided     further   that in no event shall a Holder s liability pursuant to this   Subsection 2.8(d)  , when combined with the amounts paid or payable by such Holder pursuant to   Subsection 2.8(b)  , exceed the proceeds from the related offering received by such Holder (net of any Selling Expenses paid by such Holder), except in the case of willful misconduct or fraud by such Holder.  
  (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions in the underwriting agreement shall control between the parties to such agreement.  
  (f) Unless otherwise superseded by an underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten public offering, the obligations of the Company and Holders under this   Subsection 2.8   shall survive the completion of any offering of Registrable Securities in a registration under this   Section 2  , and otherwise shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  
  2.9   Reports Under Exchange Act  . With a view to making available to the Holders the benefits of SEC Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the SEC that may at any time permit a Holder to sell securities of the Company to the public without registration or pursuant to a registration on Form S-3, the Company shall:  
  (a) make and keep available adequate current public information, as those terms are understood and defined in SEC Rule 144;  
  (b) use commercially reasonable efforts to file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time after the Company is subject to such reporting requirements); and  
  (c) furnish to any Holder, so long as the Holder owns any Registrable Securities, forthwith upon request (i) to the extent accurate, a written statement by the Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of SEC Rule 144, the Securities Act, and the Exchange Act, or that it qualifies as a registrant whose securities may be resold pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after the Company so qualifies); and (ii) such other information as may be  reasonably requested in availing any Holder of any rule or regulation of the SEC that permits the selling of any such securities without registration or pursuant to Form S-3 (at any time after the Company so qualifies to use such form).

If (x) the Company issues an earnings release or other material news or a material event relating to the Company and its subsidiaries occurs during the last 17 days of the Holdback Period or (y) prior to the expiration of the Holdback Period, the Company announces that it will release earnings results during the 16-day period beginning upon the expiration of the Holdback Period, then to the extent necessary for a managing or co-managing underwriter of an underwritten offering required hereunder to comply with FINRA Rule 2711(f)(4) or any successor regulation, the Holdback Period shall be extended until 18 days after the earnings release or the occurrence of the material news or event, as the case may be (such period the    Holdback Extension   ). The Company may impose stop-transfer instructions with respect to its securities that are subject to the forgoing restriction until the end of such period, including any period of Holdback Extension. The foregoing provisions of this   Subsection 2.11   shall (i) not apply to the sale of any shares to an underwriter pursuant to an underwriting agreement, (ii) shall be applicable to the Holders only if all officers and directors are subject to substantially the same restrictions and the Company uses commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a similar agreement from all stockholders individually owning more than five percent (5%) of the Company s outstanding Common Stock (after giving effect to conversion into Common Stock of all outstanding Preferred Stock (as defined in the Voluntary Conversion Agreement)) and (iii) shall be applicable to the Holders only if the Company has complied with its obligations under   Section 2   and has included at least 75% of the Registered Securities requested by such Holders in such underwritten offering. The underwriters in connection with such underwritten offering are intended third-party beneficiaries of this   Subsection 2.11   and shall have the right, power and authority to enforce the provisions hereof as though they were a party hereto. Each Holder further agrees to execute such agreements as may be reasonably requested by the underwriters in connection with such underwritten offering that are consistent with this   Subsection 2.11   or that are necessary to give further effect thereto.  
    
  2.12   Termination of Registration Rights  . The right of any Holder to request registration or inclusion of Registrable Securities in any registration pursuant to   Subsections 2.1   or 2.2 shall terminate upon when all shares of such Holder s that were Registrable Securities cease to be Registrable Securities, provided that the indemnification provisions of   Subsection 2.8   shall survive such termination.
