1.                        Business and Organization 
  Business 
  Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT II, Inc. (which may be referred to as the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) was organized as a Maryland corporation on January 9, 2007 and has elected to be taxed, and currently qualifies, as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for federal income tax purposes. 
  We were formed primarily to acquire and operate commercial real estate and real estate-related assets on an opportunistic and value-add basis.  In particular, we have focused generally on acquiring commercial properties with significant possibilities for capital appreciation, such as those requiring development, redevelopment, or repositioning, those located in markets and submarkets with high growth potential, and those available from sellers who are distressed or face time-sensitive deadlines.  We have acquired a wide variety of commercial properties, including office, industrial, retail, hospitality and multifamily.  We have purchased existing, income-producing properties, and newly-constructed properties.  We have also invested in a mortgage loan and a mezzanine loan.  We are not actively seeking to purchase additional assets at this time, but may invest capital in our current assets in order to position them for sale in the normal course of business.  We intend to hold the various real properties in which we have invested until such time as our board of directors determines that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve our investment objectives or until it appears that the objectives will not be met.  Consistent with our investment objectives of commencing a liquidation within three to six years after the termination of our initial public offering, we have entered our disposition phase and our board of directors is in the process of considering the orderly disposition of our assets.  As of September 30, 2016, we had   eight   real estate investments,   seven   of which were consolidated.    One   of our consolidated properties is wholly owned and   six   properties are consolidated through investments in joint ventures. 
  Substantially all of our business is conducted through Behringer Harvard Opportunity OP II LP, a limited partnership organized in Delaware (the  Operating Partnership ).  As of September 30, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, BHO II, Inc., a Delaware corporation, owned a   0.1%   partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner.  As of September 30, 2016, our wholly-owned subsidiary, BHO Business Trust II, a Maryland business trust, was the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership and owned the remaining   99.9%   interest in the Operating Partnership. 
  We are externally managed and advised by Behringer Harvard Opportunity Advisors II, LLC (the  Advisor ).  The Advisor is responsible for managing our day-to-day affairs and for services related to the sale of our assets. 
  Organization 
  In connection with our initial capitalization, we issued   22,471   shares of our common stock and   1,000   shares of our convertible stock to Behringer Harvard Holdings, LLC ( Behringer ) on January 19, 2007.  Behringer transferred its shares of convertible stock to one of its affiliates on April 2, 2010.  As of September 30, 2016, we had   25.4 million   shares of common stock outstanding and   1,000   shares of convertible stock outstanding held by an affiliate of Behringer. 
  Our common stock is not currently listed on a national securities exchange.  The timing of a liquidity event will depend upon then prevailing market conditions.  Our board of directors is in the process of considering the orderly disposition of our assets and we can provide no assurances as to the timing of our ultimate liquidation.  As we sell assets, we expect to distribute net proceeds to our stockholders.

2.                         Interim Unaudited Financial Information 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was filed with the SEC on March 16, 2016.  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted in this report on Form 10-Q pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 
  The results for the interim periods shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of future financial results.  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the condensed consolidated statements of equity and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have not been audited by our independent registered public accounting firm.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments necessary to fairly present our condensed consolidated financial position as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and our condensed consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. 
  In the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, all dollar and share amounts in tabulation are in thousands of dollars and shares, respectively, unless otherwise noted. 

3.                            Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Described below are certain of our significant accounting policies.  The disclosures regarding several of the policies have been condensed or omitted in accordance with interim reporting regulations specified by Form 10-Q.  Please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for a complete listing of all of our significant accounting policies. 
  Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  These estimates include such items as impairment of long-lived assets, depreciation and amortization, and allowance for doubtful accounts.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements include our accounts and the accounts of other subsidiaries over which we have control.  All inter-company transactions, balances, profits, and the accounts of variable interest entities, if any, in which we are the primary beneficiary have been eliminated in consolidation.  Interests in entities acquired will be evaluated based on applicable GAAP, which includes the requirement to consolidate entities deemed to be variable interest entities ( VIE ) in which we are the primary beneficiary.  If the interest in the entity is determined not to be a VIE, then the entity will be evaluated for consolidation based on legal form, economic substance, and the extent to which we have control, substantive participating rights or both under the respective ownership agreement.  For entities in which we have less than a controlling interest or entities which we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary, we account for the investment using the equity method of accounting. 
  There are judgments and estimates involved in determining if an entity in which we have made an investment is a VIE and, if so, whether we are the primary beneficiary.  The entity is evaluated to determine if it is a VIE by, among other things, calculating the percentage of equity being risked compared to the total equity of the entity.  Determining expected future losses involves assumptions of various possibilities of the results of future operations of the entity, assigning a probability to each possibility and using a discount rate to determine the net present value of those future losses.  A change in the judgments, assumptions, and estimates outlined above could result in consolidating an entity that should not be consolidated or accounting for an investment using the equity method that should in fact be consolidated, the effects of which could be material to our financial statements.

Real Estate 
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, accumulated depreciation and amortization related to our consolidated investments in real estate assets and intangibles were as follows:  

We amortize the value of in-place leases, in-place tenant improvements, and in-place leasing commissions to expense over the initial term of the respective leases.  In no event does the amortization period for intangible assets or liabilities exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building.  Should a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the acquired lease intangibles related to that tenant would be charged to expense. 
  Anticipated net amortization expense (accretion) associated with the acquired lease intangibles for each of the following five years as of September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

Real Estate Held for Sale 
  We classify properties as held for sale when certain criteria are met in accordance with GAAP.  At that time, we present the assets and obligations of the property held for sale separately in our consolidated balance sheet and we cease recording depreciation and amortization expense related to that property.  Properties held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or their estimated fair value, less estimated costs to sell.  We did not have any real estate assets classified as held for sale as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  
  Investment Impairment 
  For all of our real estate and real estate-related investments, we monitor events and changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying amounts of the real estate assets may not be recoverable.  Examples of the types of events and circumstances that would cause management to assess our assets for potential impairment include, but are not limited to: a significant decrease in the market price of an asset; a significant adverse change in the manner in which the asset is being used; an accumulation of costs in excess of the acquisition basis plus construction of the property; major vacancies and the resulting loss of revenues; natural disasters; a change in the projected holding period; legitimate purchase offers and changes in the global and local markets or economic conditions.  Our assets may at times be concentrated in limited geographic locations and, to the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in limited geographic locations, downturns specifically related to such regions may result in tenants defaulting on their lease obligations at those properties within a short time period, which may result in asset impairments.  When such events or changes in circumstances are present, we assess potential impairment by comparing estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated over the life of the asset and from its eventual

     Table of Contents

  (unaudited) 

disposition to the carrying amount of the asset.  These projected cash flows are prepared internally by the Advisor and reflect in-place and projected leasing activity, market revenue and expense growth rates, market capitalization rates, discount rates, and changes in economic and other relevant conditions.  The Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer review these projected cash flows to assure that the valuation is prepared using reasonable inputs and assumptions that are consistent with market data or with assumptions that would be used by a third-party market participant and assume the highest and best use of the investment.  We consider trends, strategic decisions regarding future development plans, and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to adjust the carrying amount of the asset to estimated fair value.  While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, different assumptions regarding factors such as market rents, economic conditions, and occupancy rates could significantly affect these estimates. 
  In evaluating our investments for impairment, management may use appraisals and make estimates and assumptions, including, but not limited to, the projected date of disposition of the properties, the estimated future cash flows of the properties during our ownership, and the projected sales price of each of the properties.  A future change in these estimates and assumptions could result in understating or overstating the carrying value of our investments, which could be material to our financial statements.  In addition, we may incur impairment charges on assets classified as held for sale in the future if the carrying amount of the asset upon classification as held for sale exceeds the estimated fair value, less costs to sell. 
  We also evaluate our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures at each reporting date.  If we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value, we will record an impairment charge based on these evaluations.  We assess potential impairment by comparing our portion of estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows expected to be generated by the joint venture over the life of the joint venture s assets to the carrying amount of the joint venture.  In the event that the carrying amount exceeds our portion of estimated future undiscounted operating cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to adjust the carrying amount of the joint venture to its estimated fair value. 
  We believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets and our investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is currently recoverable.  There were   no   impairment charges for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  However, if market conditions worsen unexpectedly or if changes in our strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value calculations, we may need to take charges in future periods for impairments related to our existing investments.  Any such non-cash charges would have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
  Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture 
  We provide funding to third-party developers for the acquisition, development, and construction of real estate ( ADC Arrangement ).  Under an ADC Arrangement, we may participate in the residual profits of the project through the sale or refinancing of the property.  We evaluate this arrangement to determine if it has characteristics similar to a loan or if the characteristics are more similar to a joint venture or partnership such as participating in the risks and rewards of the project as an owner or an investment partner.  When we determine that the characteristics are more similar to a jointly-owned investment or partnership, we account for the arrangement as an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method of accounting or a direct investment (consolidated basis of accounting) instead of applying loan accounting.  The ADC Arrangement is reassessed at each reporting period.  See Note 9, Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture, for further discussion. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  We recognize rental income generated from leases of our operating properties on a straight-line basis over the terms of the respective leases, including the effect of rent holidays, if any.  Straight-line rent was income of less than   $0.1 million   recognized in rental revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  Leases associated with our multifamily, student housing, and hotel assets are generally short-term in nature, and thus have no straight-line rent.  Net above-market lease amortization was a charge of less than   $0.1 million   recognized in rental revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Net below-market lease amortization was income of less than   $0.1 million   recognized in rental revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  Hotel revenue is derived from the operations of the Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel and consists primarily of guest room, food and beverage, and other ancillary revenues such as laundry and parking.  Hotel revenue is recognized as the services are rendered.

Accounts Receivable 
  Accounts receivable primarily consist of receivables related to our consolidated properties of   $1.5 million   and   $2.4 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and included straight-line rental revenue receivables of   $0.3 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   
  Furniture, Fixtures, and Equipment 
  Furniture, fixtures, and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated according to the Company s capitalization policy, which uses the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of   five   to   seven years  .  Furniture, fixtures, and equipment associated with properties classified as held for sale are not depreciated.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  Accumulated depreciation associated with our furniture, fixtures, and equipment was   $9.4 million   and   $8.1 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  Deferred Financing Fees 
  Deferred financing fees are recorded at cost and are amortized to interest expense using a straight-line method that approximates the effective interest method over the life of the related debt.  Deferred financing fees, net of accumulated amortization, were   $0.9 million   and   $1.7 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Accumulated amortization of deferred financing fees were   $1.8 million   and   $2.5 million   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an update ( ASU 2015-03 ) to ASC Topic 835, Interest - Imputation of Interest, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  The adoption of ASU 2015-03, effective January 1, 2016, requires companies to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, retrospectively.  
  The adoption of the new standard resulted in the following reclassifications of unamortized deferred financing fees as of December 31, 2015: 

Income Taxes 
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), and have qualified as a REIT since the year ended December 31, 2008.  To qualify as a REIT, we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that we distribute at least   90%   of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders.  As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax at the corporate level.  We are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code and intend to continue to operate in such a manner, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.  Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ) is subject to applicable federal, state, and local income and margin taxes.  We currently have no taxable income associated with a TRS.  Our operating partnerships are flow-through entities and are not subject to federal income taxes at the entity level. 
  As a result of the sale of one of our foreign investments during the first quarter of 2015, Alte Jakobstra e ( AJS ), we recorded estimated foreign income tax of approximately   $2.2 million   during the period ended March 31, 2015.  During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a credit of   $0.5 million   to the provision for income tax based on a change in the estimated taxes payable on the sale of AJS.  We recorded a provision for income tax of approximately   $1 million   in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of estimated foreign income tax related to the sale of Holstenplatz, resulting in a total income tax provision of   $2.7 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded a credit of less than   $0.1 million   to the provision for income tax based on the difference in the actual taxes due and the originally estimated taxes payable on the sale of Holstenplatz.  The foreign income tax recorded during 2015 was calculated on gains recognized at the exchange rate in effect on the date of sale and calculated using current tax rates.   
  We have reviewed our tax positions under GAAP guidance that clarify the relevant criteria and approach for the recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions.  The guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken, or expected to be taken, in a tax return.  A tax position  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  
  Behringer Harvard Opportunity REIT II, Inc. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  (unaudited) 

may only be recognized in the financial statements if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination.  We believe it is more likely than not that the tax positions taken relative to our federal tax status as a REIT will be sustained in any tax examination.  
  Foreign Currency Translation 
  For our international investments where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, assets and liabilities are translated using period-end exchange rates, while the statement of operations amounts are translated using the average exchange rates for the respective period.  Gains and losses resulting from the change in exchange rates from period to period are reported separately as a component of other comprehensive income (loss).  Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). 
  The Euro is the functional currency for the operations of AJS and Holstenplatz, which were both sold in 2015.  We sold AJS on February 21, 2015 and Holstenplatz on September 1, 2015.  We maintain a Euro-denominated bank account that is comprised primarily of the remaining proceeds from the sale of these properties and is translated into U.S. dollars at the current exchange rate at each reporting period.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the foreign currency translation adjustment was a gain of less than   $0.1 million   and a gain of   $0.1 million  , respectively.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the foreign currency translation adjustment was a gain of   $0.1 million   and a loss of   $0.2 million  , respectively.   
  When the Company has substantially liquidated its investment in a foreign entity, the cumulative translation adjustment ( CTA ) balance is required to be released into earnings.  In accordance with ASU 2013-05, upon disposal of the property, we would recognize the CTA as an adjustment to the gain on sale.  During the first quarter of 2015, we recognized a CTA of approximately   $0.6 million   as a reduction to the gain on sale of our AJS office building, which we sold on February 21, 2015.  We sold our wholly owned investment in the Holstenplatz office building on September 1, 2015.  We recognized a CTA credit of approximately   $0.4 million   as an increase to the gain on sale of Holstenplatz.  With the sale of Holstenplatz, we no longer have foreign operations. 
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents deposited in certain financial institutions in excess of federally insured levels.  We have diversified our cash and cash equivalents among several banking institutions in an attempt to minimize exposure to any one of these entities.  We regularly monitor the financial stability of these financial institutions and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in cash and cash equivalents or restricted cash. 
  Geographic and Asset Type Concentration 
  Our investments may at times be concentrated in certain asset types that are subject to higher risk of foreclosure, or secured by assets concentrated in a limited number of geographic locations.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, excluding sold assets,   44%   and   15%   of our total revenues were derived from our properties located in Hawaii and Florida, respectively.  Additionally, excluding our property sold in 2016,   44%  ,   30%  , and   21%   of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were from our hotel, multifamily, and student housing investments, respectively.  To the extent that our portfolio is concentrated in limited geographic regions or types of assets, downturns relating generally to such region or type of asset may result in defaults on a number of our investments within a short time period, which may reduce our net income and the value of our common stock and accordingly limit our ability to fund our operations. 
  Noncontrolling Interest 
  Noncontrolling interest represents the noncontrolling ownership interest s proportionate share of the equity in our consolidated real estate investments.  Income and losses are allocated to noncontrolling interest holders based generally on their ownership percentage.  In certain instances, our joint venture agreement provides for liquidating distributions based on achieving certain return metrics ( promoted interest ).  If a property reaches a defined return threshold, then it will result in distributions to noncontrolling interest which is different from the standard pro-rata allocation percentage. 
  Earnings per Share 
  Net income per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  The weighted average shares outstanding used to calculate both basic and diluted income per share were the same for

each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as there were   no   potentially dilutive securities outstanding.  
  Subsequent Events 
  We have evaluated subsequent events for recognition or disclosure in our condensed consolidated financial statements.   

4.                       New Accounting Pronouncements  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2014-09 ) to ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most of the existing revenue recognition guidance.  The new guidance will require companies to apply a five-step model in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers, as well as enhance disclosures regarding revenue recognition.  Lease contracts will be excluded from this revenue recognition criteria; however, the sale of real estate will be required to follow the new model.  ASU 2014-09 is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  In addition, early adoption will be permitted beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within those annual periods.  Either full retrospective adoption or modified retrospective adoption is permitted.  We do not expect that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements; however, we will continue to evaluate this assessment until the guidance becomes effective. 
  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, the FASB issued subsequent updates to ASU 2014-09.  In April 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-10 ) to ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  In May 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-12 ) to ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Narrow-Scope Improvement and Practical Expedients.  The amendments in these updates did not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606; rather, they added improvements to reduce the diversity in practice at initial application and the cost and complexity of applying Topic 606 both at transition and an ongoing basis.  The areas affected include: assessing the collectability criteria; presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from customers; noncash consideration; contract modification and completed contracts at transition; and technical correction as it relates to retrospective application and disclosure.  The new guidance is effective January 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted beginning January 1, 2017, and allows full or modified retrospective application.  We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements; however, we will continue to evaluate this assessment until the guidance becomes effective. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2014-15 ) to ASC Topic 205, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  ASU 2014-15 requires management s assessment of a company s ability to continue as a going concern and provide related footnote disclosures when conditions give rise to substantial doubt about a company s ability to continue as a going concern within one year from the financial statement issuance date.  ASU 2014-15 applies to all companies and is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and all annual and interim periods thereafter.  We do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on our disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-02 ) to ASC Topic 842, Leases.  ASU 2016-02 supersedes the existing lease accounting model, and modifies both lessee and lessor accounting.  The new guidance will require lessees to recognize a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset, initially measured at the present value of lease payments, for both operating and financing leases.  For leases with a term of 12 months or less, lessees will be permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset to not recognize lease liabilities and lease assets.  Under this new pronouncement, lessor accounting will be largely unchanged from existing GAAP.  The new standard will be effective January 1, 2019, with early adoption permitted.  We do not expect that the adoption of this pronouncement will have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements; however, we will continue to evaluate this assessment until the guidance becomes effective. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an update ( ASU 2016-15 ) to ASC Topic 230, Statement of Cash Flows, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  The objective of this amendment is to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statements of cash flows.  Of the eight types of cash flows discussed in the new standard, the classification of debt prepayment, distributions received from equity method investees, and debt extinguishment costs as financing outflows may impact the Company.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for public companies for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in

  (unaudited)    

an interim period.  The amendment in the update should be applied using the retrospective transition method for each period presented.  We will continue to evaluate the impact until the guidance becomes effective. 

5.                        Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value 
  Fair value measurements are determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.  As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy) has been established. 
  Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that we have the ability to access.  Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability that are typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity.  In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. 
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  Currently, we use interest rate swaps and caps to manage our interest rate risk.  The valuation of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative.  This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves, implied volatilities, and foreign currency exchange rates. 
  We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.  Although we have determined that the majority of the inputs used to value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties.  However, as of September 30, 2016, we have assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions and have determined that the credit valuation adjustments are not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.  As a result, we have determined that our derivative valuations in their entirety are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  The following fair value hierarchy table presents information about our assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015:    

Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel was our only remaining asset with an interest rate cap as of September 30, 2016 and it had a nominal value.    
  Derivative financial instruments classified as assets are included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the balance sheet. 
  Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a   $1.4 million   non-cash impairment charge as a result of a measurable decrease in the fair value of 22 Exchange, one of our student housing investments.  In estimating the fair value of 22 Exchange, we used management s internal discounted cash flow analysis prepared with consideration of the current local market.  The discounted cash flow estimate is considered Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy described above.

______________________________________ 
            (1) 
    Due to the local market decline in Akron, Ohio during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $1.4 million   on our investment in 22 Exchange, one of our student housing investments.   
     Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 

______________________________________ 
            (1) 
    Due to the local market decline in Akron, Ohio during the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of   $1.4 million   on our investment in 22 Exchange, a student housing property.    
     There were no impairment charges recorded during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

6.                       Financial Instruments not Reported at Fair Value 
  We determined the following disclosure of estimated fair values using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.  However, considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop the related estimates of fair value.  The use of different market assumptions or only estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. 
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management estimated that the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable, accrued expenses, other liabilities, payables/receivables from related parties, and distributions payable to noncontrolling interests were at amounts that reasonably approximated their fair value based on their highly-liquid nature and short-term maturities.  The fair value of the notes payable is categorized as a Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.  The fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis valuation on the borrowing rates currently available for loans with similar terms and maturities.  The fair value of the notes payable was determined by discounting the future contractual interest and principal payments by a market rate.  Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  
  Carrying amounts of our notes payable and the related estimated fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows:

7.              Real Estate and Real Estate-Related Investments 
  As of September 30, 2016, we consolidated   seven   real estate assets in our condensed consolidated balance sheet.  The following table presents certain information about our consolidated investments as of September 30, 2016: 

Real Estate Asset Disposition 
  Lakewood Flats 
  On August 16, 2016, we sold Lakewood Flats for a contract sales price of approximately   $68.8 million  , resulting in a gain on sale of real estate of   $11.5 million   and a deferred gain of approximately   $1.2 million  .  The deferred gain represents the amount of monies held in escrow to be reimbursed upon completion of the property s outstanding insurance claim.  We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of   $0.5 million  , which was composed of the write-off of deferred financing fees of   $0.4 million   and an early termination fee of   $0.1 million  .  A portion of the proceeds from the sale were used to pay off in full the existing indebtedness of approximately   $33.5 million   secured by the property.  Lakewood Flats was classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2016.  
  Sales of Real Estate Reported in Continuing Operations  
  The following table presents our sales of real estate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in millions): 

______________________________________ 
           (1)  
    A portion of the net cash proceeds was used to pay off the property-associated debt of   $33.5 million  ,   $2.1 million  ,   $6.5 million  , and   $26.4 million   for Lakewood Flats, Babcock Self Storage ( Babcock ), AJS, and Wimberly at Deerwood ( Wimberly ), respectively.  The Holstenplatz debt was paid off on April 30, 2015. 
     The Company does not view the 2016 disposal of Lakewood Flats or the 2015 disposals of Babcock, AJS, Holstenplatz, and Wimberly as a strategic shift.  Therefore, the results of operations for Lakewood Flats is presented in continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The results of operations for Babcock and AJS are presented in continuing operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The results of operations for Holstenplatz and Wimberly are presented in continuing operations in the condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Net income attributable to the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes the gain on sale of Lakewood Flats of   $11.5 million  .  Net income attributable to the Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to Babcock, AJS, Holstenplatz, and Wimberly was   $17.8 million   and includes the gains on sale for a total of   $22.8 million  .

8.                       Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Venture 
  We provided mezzanine financing totaling   $15.3 million   to an unaffiliated third-party entity (the  Borrower ) that owns an apartment complex under development in Denver, Colorado ( Prospect Park ).  The Borrower also has a senior construction loan with a third-party construction lender (the  Senior Lender ) in an aggregate principal amount up to   $40 million  .  The senior construction loan is guaranteed by the owners of the developer.  We also have a personal guaranty from the owners of the developer guaranteeing completion of the project and payment of cost overruns.  Our mezzanine loan is secured by all of the membership interests of the Borrower and is subordinate to the senior construction loan.  Our advances of   $15.3 million   have annual stated interest rates ranging from   10%   to   18%  .  We evaluated this ADC Arrangement and determined that the characteristics are similar to a jointly-owned investment or partnership.  Accordingly, the investment was accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method of accounting instead of loan accounting since we will participate in the residual interests through the sale or refinancing of the property.   
  Both the senior loan and our mezzanine loan were in technical default at July 31, 2016 due to a delay in completion of the project.  The Senior Lender and the Company have decided not to call the loan and will amend the loan agreements when construction is complete.  Completion of the project is expected to occur before the end of 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the outstanding principal balance under the mezzanine loan was   $15.3 million  .  The Borrower has been funding any cost overruns.  
  We considered the impact of these events on the accounting treatment and determined the ADC Arrangement will continue to be accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture under the equity method of accounting.  We will continue to monitor this situation and any impact these events might have on our ability to ultimately realize the investment.  The ADC Arrangement is reassessed at each reporting period.  
  In connection with this investment, interest capitalized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was less than   $0.1 million   and less than   $0.2 million  , respectively.  Interest capitalized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we recorded   no   equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated joint venture related to our investment in Prospect Park. 
  The following table sets forth our ownership interest in Prospect Park:

9.    Variable Interest Entities 
  As discussed in Note 3, effective January 1, 2016, we have adopted the guidance in ASU 2015-02.  As a result, the Operating Partnership (see Note 1) and each of our less than wholly-owned real estate partnerships (22 Exchange, LLC, Gardens Medical Pavilion, LLC, SL Parkside Apartments, LLC, and the ADC Arrangement associated with Prospect Park) have been deemed to have the characteristics of a VIE.  However, we were not required to consolidate any previously unconsolidated entities or deconsolidate any previously consolidated entities as a result of the change in classification.  Accordingly, there has been no change to the amounts reported in our condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of cash flows or amounts recognized in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  Consolidated VIEs 
  The Company consolidates the Operating Partnership, 22 Exchange, LLC, Gardens Medical Pavilion, LLC through BH-AW-Florida MOB Venture, LLC, and SL Parkside Apartments, LLC, which are variable interest entities, or VIEs, for which we are the primary beneficiary.  Generally, a VIE is a legal entity in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or the equity investors lack sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support.  A limited partnership, or legal entities such as an LLC, are considered a VIE when the majority of the limited partners unrelated to the general partner possess neither the right to remove the general partner without cause, nor certain rights to participate in the decisions that most significantly affect the financial results of the partnership.  In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we consider qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of our investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other investors to provide financial support; and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the business activities of the other investors.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of real estate held by these VIEs and general market conditions. 
  Unconsolidated VIEs 
  Included in the Company s joint venture investments at September 30, 2016 is the ADC Arrangement associated with Prospect Park, which is accounted for as an unconsolidated joint venture and is a VIE.  Refer to Note 8 for further details on the ADC Arrangement.  This arrangement was established to provide mezzanine financing to an unaffiliated third party that owns Prospect Park, an apartment complex under development in Denver, Colorado.  Based on our reevaluation under ASU 2015-02, we determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of this VIE based on the rights of the general partner.  The arrangement does not allow for substantive kick-out rights over the general partner and we do not have the power to direct the activities of Prospect Park that most significantly affect the entity s economic performance.  Accordingly, we have determined it is appropriate, consistent with past accounting, that the Prospect Park ADC Arrangement will continue to be accounted for under the equity method. 
  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, total assets of the property under development were approximately   $74 million   and   $63.9 million  , respectively.  Total assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were made up of construction in progress of   $63.6 million   and   $53.5 million  , respectively, land of   $9.8 million  , and other assets of   $0.6 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively.  The outstanding balance on the senior construction loan as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was   $35.7 million   and   $26.9 million  , respectively.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal balance of our mezzanine loan was   $15.3 million  . 
  The Company s maximum exposure to losses associated with its unconsolidated joint venture is limited to its carrying value in this investment.  As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s carrying value and maximum exposure to loss in this investment was   $14.7 million   and   $14.5 million  , respectively.

10.                         Notes Payable 
  The following table sets forth information on our notes payable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

_________________________________ 
            (2)   
    Includes approximately   $0.3 million   of unamortized premium related to debt we assumed at acquisition. 
              (3) 
    On August 16, 2016, we sold Lakewood Flats to an unaffiliated third party.  A portion of the proceeds from the sale were used to payoff the existing indebtedness associated with the property. 
     (4)  Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted ASU 2015-03, which requires companies to present the debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability.  See Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for further details. 
  At September 30, 2016, our notes payable balance was   $142.8 million  , net of deferred financing fees of   $0.9 million  .  We have guaranteed payment of certain recourse liabilities with respect to certain customary nonrecourse carveouts as set forth in the guaranties in favor of the unaffiliated lenders with respect to the Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel, 22 Exchange, and Parkside notes payable.  Interest capitalized in connection with our equity method investment in Prospect Park for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was less than   $0.1 million   and less than   $0.2 million  , respectively.  Interest capitalized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million  , respectively. 
  On August 16, 2016, we sold Lakewood Flats to an unaffiliated third party and used a portion of the proceeds from the sale to fully satisfy the existing indebtedness of approximately   $33.5 million  .

We are subject to customary affirmative, negative, and financial covenants and representations, warranties, and borrowing conditions, all as set forth in our loan agreements, including, among other things, maintaining minimum debt service coverage ratios, loan to value ratios and liquidity.  As of September 30, 2016, we believe we were in compliance with the covenants under our loan agreements.  The following table summarizes our contractual obligations for principal payments as of September 30, 2016:   

11.                   Leasing Activity 
  Future minimum base rental payments of our remaining office property due to us under non-cancelable leases in effect as of September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

The schedule above does not include rental payments due to us from our multifamily, hotel, and student housing properties, as leases associated with these properties typically are for periods of   one year   or less.  We have   one   remaining office property at September 30, 2016, Gardens Medical Pavilion, located in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

12.                   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  We may be exposed to the risk associated with variability of interest rates that might impact our cash flows and the results of operations.  The hedging strategy of entering into interest rate caps and swaps, therefore, is to eliminate or reduce, to the extent possible, the volatility of cash flows.  As of September 30, 2016, we had   one   remaining interest rate cap which was not designated as a hedging instrument.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of our derivative instrument had a nominal value and was reported in prepaid expenses and other assets.   
  The following table summarizes the notional value of our derivative financial instrument.  The notional value provides an indication of the extent of our involvement in this instrument, but does not represent exposure to credit, interest rate, or market risks:

13.                  Distributions  
  Distributions are authorized at the discretion of our board of directors based on its analysis of our performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods.  These analyses may include actual and anticipated operating cash flow, changes in market capitalization rates for investments suitable for our portfolio, capital expenditure needs, general financial and market conditions, proceeds from asset sales, and other factors that our board deems relevant.  The board s decision will be substantially influenced by its obligation to ensure that we maintain our federal tax status as a REIT.  We cannot provide assurance that we will pay distributions at any particular level, or at all.  We expect that any future distributions authorized by our board of directors will be periodic, special distributions as opposed to regular monthly or quarterly distributions. 
  On November 20, 2015, our board of directors authorized a special cash distribution of   $1.50   per share of common stock, payable to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2015.  The Company paid this special cash distribution of   $38.4 million   on January 5, 2016.  On March 18, 2015, our board of directors authorized a special cash distribution of   $1.00   per share of common stock, payable to stockholders of record as of March 30, 2015.  This special cash distribution of   $25.7 million   was paid on March 31, 2015.  These special cash distributions represented a portion of proceeds from asset sales.

14.                  Related Party Transactions  
  Advisor 
  The Advisor and certain of its affiliates may receive fees and compensation in connection with the management and sale of our assets based on the advisory management agreement, as amended and restated. 
  Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Management Agreement 
  On July 25, 2016, we entered into the Fifth Amended and Restated Advisory Management Agreement (the  Fifth Advisory Agreement ) with our Advisor to, among other things, revise the administrative services fee, amend the non-solicitation provision, and extend the term of the agreement to June 6, 2017.  The Fifth Advisory Agreement is effective as of June 6, 2016.  
  The Advisor or its affiliates receive acquisition and advisory fees of   1.5%   of the amount paid in respect of the purchase, development, construction, or improvement of each asset we acquire, including any debt attributable to those assets.  In addition, the Advisor and its affiliates receive acquisition and advisory fees of   1.5%   of the funds advanced in respect of a loan investment.  We incurred   no   acquisition and advisory fees payable to the Advisor for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  We incurred acquisition and advisory fees payable to the Advisor of less than   $0.1 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of improvements made to our assets.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had   no   acquisitions. 
  The Advisor or its affiliates also receive an acquisition expense reimbursement in the amount of (i)   0.25%   of the funds paid for purchasing an asset, including any debt attributable to the asset, plus   0.25%   of the funds budgeted for development, construction, or improvement in the case of assets that we acquire and intend to develop, construct, or improve or (ii)   0.25%   of the funds advanced in respect of a loan investment.  We also pay third parties, or reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates, for any investment-related expenses due to third parties in the case of a completed investment, including, but not limited to, legal fees and expenses, travel and communication expenses, costs of appraisals, accounting fees and expenses, third-party brokerage or finder's fees, title insurance, premium expenses, and other closing costs. 
  The Advisor and its affiliates are also responsible for paying all of the investment-related expenses that we or the Advisor or its affiliates incur that are due to third parties or related to the additional services provided by the Advisor as described above with respect to investments we do not make, other than certain non-refundable payments made in connection with any acquisition.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred   no   acquisition expense reimbursements.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred less than   $0.1 million   in acquisition expense reimbursements. 
  We pay the Advisor or its affiliates a debt financing fee of   0.5%   of the amount available under any loan or line of credit made available to us and pay directly all third-party costs associated with obtaining the debt financing.  We incurred   no   debt financing fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
  We pay the Advisor or its affiliates a development fee in an amount that is usual and customary for comparable services rendered to similar projects in the geographic market of the project if such affiliate provides the development services and if a majority of our independent directors determines that such development fee is fair and reasonable to us.  We incurred   no   such fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
  We pay the Advisor or its affiliates a monthly asset management fee of one-twelfth of 0.7% of the value of each asset.  The value of our assets will be the value as determined in connection with the establishment and publication of an estimated value per share unless the asset was acquired after our publication of an estimated value per share (in which case the value of the asset will be the contract purchase price of the asset).  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we expensed   $1.6 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, of asset management fees payable to the Advisor.  The totals for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include asset management fees related to our disposed properties. 
  The Advisor is responsible for paying all of the expenses it incurs associated with persons employed by the Advisor to the extent that they provide services related to us for which the Advisor receives an acquisition, asset management, or debt financing fee, including wages and benefits of the personnel.  Instead of reimbursing the Advisor for specific expenses paid or incurred in connection with providing services to us, we pay the Advisor an administrative services fee based on a budget of expenses prepared by the Advisor.  The administrative services fee is intended to reimburse for all costs associated with providing services to us.  Under the Fifth Advisory Agreement, the administrative services fee is the lesser of (i)   $1.3 million   per calendar year, and (ii) the costs of providing administrative services to us under the Fifth Advisory Agreement, payable in

  (unaudited)    

four   equal quarterly installments within   45   days of the end of each calendar quarter.  For the calendar year ending December 31, 2015, the administrative services fee was   $1.5 million  .  In addition, under the advisory management agreement, we are to reimburse the Advisor for certain due diligence services provided in connection with asset dispositions or debt financings separately from the administrative services fee.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we incurred and expensed such costs for administrative services and due diligence services of approximately   $0.9 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively.  Included in that amount is less than   $0.1 million   related to certain due diligence services provided in connection with asset dispositions during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
  Notwithstanding the fees and cost reimbursements payable to our Advisor pursuant to the Fifth Advisory Agreement, under our charter we may not reimburse the Advisor for any amount by which our operating expenses (including the asset management fee) at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceeds the greater of: (i)   2%   of our average invested assets, or (ii)   25%   of our net income determined without reduction for any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debts, or other similar non-cash reserves and excluding any gain from the sale of our assets for that period unless a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors.  For the four fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2016, our total operating expenses (including the asset management fee) were not excessive.  
  Property Manager 
  We pay our property manager and affiliate of the Advisor, Behringer Harvard Opportunity II Management Services, LLC  or its affiliates (collectively, our  Property Manager ), fees for the management, leasing, and construction supervision of our properties which is   4.0%   of gross revenues of the properties managed by our Property Manager.  We pay our Property Manager an oversight fee equal to   0.5%   of the gross revenues of the property managed for any property for which we contract directly with a third-party property manager.  In no event will our Property Manager receive both a property management fee and an oversight fee with respect to any particular property.  In the event we own a property through a joint venture that does not pay our Property Manager directly for its services, we will pay our Property Manager a management fee or oversight fee, as applicable, based only on our economic interest in the property.  We incurred and expensed property management fees or oversight fees to our Property Manager of approximately   $0.4 million   and   $0.5 million   for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  We pay our Property Manager a construction management fee in an amount not to exceed   5%   of all hard construction costs incurred in connection with, but not limited to capital repairs and improvements, major building reconstruction and tenant improvements, if such affiliate supervises construction performed by or on behalf of us or our affiliates.  We incurred   no   construction management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
  We are dependent on the Advisor and our Property Manager for certain services that are essential to us, including asset disposition decisions, property management and leasing services, and other general administrative responsibilities.  In the event that these companies were unable to provide us with their respective services, we would be required to obtain such services from other sources.

Cautionary Note 
  The representations, warranties, and covenants made by us in any agreement filed as an exhibit to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are made solely for the benefit of the parties to the agreement, including, in some cases, for the purpose of allocating risk among the parties to the agreement, and should not be deemed to be representations, warranties, or covenants to or with any other parties.  Moreover, these representations, warranties, or covenants should not be relied upon as accurately describing or reflecting the current state of our affairs.  

Executive Overview 
  We were formed primarily to acquire and operate commercial real estate and real estate-related assets on an opportunistic and value-add basis.  In particular, we have focused generally on acquiring commercial properties with significant possibilities for capital appreciation, such as those requiring development, redevelopment or repositioning, those located in markets and submarkets with high growth potential, and those available from sellers who were distressed or faced time-sensitive deadlines.  In addition, our opportunistic and value-add investment strategy has included investments in real estate-related assets that present opportunities for higher current income.  Since inception, we have acquired a wide variety of commercial properties, including office, industrial, retail, hospitality, and multifamily.  We have purchased existing, income-producing properties and newly constructed properties.  We have also invested in a mortgage loan and a mezzanine loan.  We have made our investments in or in respect of real estate assets located in the United States and other countries based on our view of existing market conditions.  Currently, our investments include multifamily and student housing communities, an office building, a hotel, and a mezzanine loan.  All of our current investments are located in the United States.  We are not actively seeking to purchase additional assets at this time and have entered our disposition phase.  Consistent with our investment objectives of commencing a liquidation within three to six years after the termination of our initial public offering, we have entered our disposition phase and our board of directors is in the process of considering the orderly disposition of our assets. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  We had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of $69.7 million at September 30, 2016.  Our principal demands for funds going forward will be for the payment of (a) operating expenses, (b) interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness, and (c) special distributions.  Generally, we expect to meet cash needs for the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness from our cash flow from operations and to fund special distributions (if any) from our proceeds from asset sales.  To the extent that our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to cover our operating expenses, interest on our outstanding indebtedness, or redemptions, we expect to use borrowings and asset sales to fund such needs. 
  We are not actively seeking to purchase additional properties, but may invest capital in our current assets in order to position them for sale in the normal course of business.  We intend to hold our various real properties until such time as our board of directors determines that a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve our investment objectives or until it appears that the objectives will not be met.  Our board of directors is in the process of considering the orderly disposition of our assets.  We sold Lakewood Flats in the third quarter of 2016 and sold four properties in 2015. 
  On January 5, 2016, we paid a special cash distribution of $38.4 million, or $1.50 per share of common stock.  On March 31, 2015, we paid a special cash distribution of $25.7 million, or $1.00 per share of common stock.  Both distributions were funded from proceeds of asset sales.  
  We continually evaluate our liquidity and ability to fund future operations and debt obligations.  The next debt maturity for the Company is May 2017, related to the Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel.  If we have not disposed of the property by the maturity date, we will either repay the outstanding balance with available cash or refinance all or a portion of the balance outstanding.  In addition to our debt obligations, we consider other factors in evaluating our liquidity.  For example, to the extent our portfolio is concentrated in certain geographic regions and types of assets, downturns relating generally to such regions and assets may result in tenants defaulting on their lease obligations at a number of our properties within a short time period.  Such defaults could negatively affect our liquidity and adversely affect our ability to fund our ongoing operations.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, excluding sold assets, 44% and 15% of our total revenues were derived from our properties located in Hawaii and Florida, respectively.  Additionally, excluding our property sold in 2016, 44% of our total revenues were from our hotel property and 30% were from our multifamily properties.   
  We may, but are not required to, establish capital reserves from cash flow generated by operating properties and other investments, or net sales proceeds from the sale of our properties and other investments.  Capital reserves are typically utilized for non-operating expenses such as tenant improvements, leasing commissions, and major capital expenditures.  Alternatively, a lender may establish its own criteria for escrow of capital reserves. 
  
   26 

     Table of Contents  

We have borrowed money to acquire properties and make other investments.  Under our charter, the maximum amount of our indebtedness is limited to 300% of our  net assets  (as defined by our charter) as of the date of any borrowing; however, we may exceed that limit if approved by a majority of our independent directors.  In addition to our charter limitation, our board of directors has adopted a policy to generally limit our aggregate borrowings to approximately 75% of the aggregate value of our assets unless substantial justification exists that borrowing a greater amount is in our best interests.  Our policy limitation, however, does not apply to individual real estate assets. 
  Commercial real estate debt markets may experience volatility and uncertainty as a result of certain related factors, including the tightening of underwriting standards by lenders and credit rating agencies, macro-economic issues related to fiscal, tax and regulatory policies, and global financial issues.  Should the overall cost of borrowings increase, either by increases in the index rates or by increases in lender spreads, we will need to factor such increases into the economics of our developments and investments.  This may result in our investment operations generating lower overall economic returns and a reduced level of cash flow, which could potentially impact our ability to make special distributions to our stockholders.  In addition, disruptions in the debt markets may reduce the amount of capital that is available to finance real estate, which in turn could: (i) lead to a decline in real estate values generally; (ii) slow real estate transaction activity; (iii) reduce the loan to value ratio upon which lenders are willing to extend debt; and (iv) result in difficulty in refinancing debt as it becomes due, all of which may reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on the value of real estate investments and the revenues, income or cash flow from the operations of real properties and mortgage loans. 
  Debt Financings 
  From time to time, we have obtained mortgage, bridge, or mezzanine loans for acquisitions and investments, as well as property development.  In the future, we may obtain financing for property development or refinance our existing real estate assets, depending on multiple factors. 
  At September 30, 2016, our notes payable balance was $142.8 million, net of deferred financing fees of $0.9 million and had a weighted average interest rate of 3.8%.  As of December 31, 2015, the Company had notes payable of $177 million, net of deferred financing fees of $1.7 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.5%.  We have guaranteed payment of certain recourse liabilities with respect to certain customary nonrecourse carveouts as set forth in the guaranties in favor of the unaffiliated lenders with respect to the Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel, 22 Exchange, and Parkside notes payable. 
  On August 16, 2016, we sold Lakewood Flats to an unaffiliated third party and used a portion of the proceeds from the sale to pay off in full the existing indebtedness of approximately $33.5 million. 
  Our loan agreements stipulate that we comply with certain reporting and financial covenants.  These covenants include, among other things, maintaining minimum debt service coverage ratios, loan to value ratios, and liquidity.  As of September 30, 2016, we believe we were in compliance with the debt covenants under our loan agreements. 
  One of our principal short-term and long-term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt.  The following table provides information with respect to the contractual maturities and scheduled principal repayments of our indebtedness as of September 30, 2016.  Interest payments on variable rate debt are based on rates in effect as of September 30, 2016.  The table does not represent any extension options (in thousands):

Results of Operations 
  As of September 30, 2016, we had eight real estate investments, seven of which were consolidated (one wholly owned and six properties consolidated through investments in joint ventures).  We sold Lakewood Flats on August 16, 2016. 
  As of September 30, 2015, we had nine real estate investments, eight of which were consolidated, (one wholly owned and seven properties consolidated through investments in joint ventures).  We sold four properties during 2015: Babcock and AJS in the first quarter and Holstenplatz and Wimberly in the third quarter.  
  Three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
  The following table provides summary information about our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 ($ in thousands):

Continuing Operations 
  Our results of operations for the respective periods presented reflect decreases in most categories.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had decreases in rental revenue and property operating expenses of $1.9 million and $0.5 million, respectively, from the impact of our dispositions in 2016 and 2015.  Management expects decreases in most categories in the future as we dispose of additional real estate and real estate-related assets.  We are not actively seeking to purchase additional assets at this time, but may invest capital in our current assets in order to position them for sale in the normal course of business.   
  Revenues.      Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016, including Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel, were $11.4 million, a decrease of approximately $1.1 million from the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Same Store rental revenue (including our hotel revenue) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $10.6 million and $9.8 million, respectively.  Rental revenue from Lakewood Flats, which was sold in the third quarter of 2016, was $0.8 million and $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   Rental revenue from Holstenplatz and Wimberly, which were disposed of in 2015, was $1.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
  The change in revenue is primarily due to: 
             
    a decrease in rental revenue of $1.9 million during the third quarter of 2016 as a result of our 2016 and 2015 dispositions.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.3 million related to our Same Store operations; and 
                
    an increase in hotel revenue of $0.5 million, or 11.1%, at the Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel due to a 9.3% increase in occupancy rate and a 7.1% increase in revenue per available room ( RevPar ) period-over-period.  
     Property Operating Expenses.      Property operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $2.6 million and $3.2 million, respectively.  The decrease of approximately $0.6 million was primarily due to our dispositions in 2016 and 2015.  
  Hotel Operating Expenses.      Hotel operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $3.5 million and $3.2 million, respectively.  The increase in hotel operating expenses was primarily due to an increase of $0.2 million in food and beverage costs incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 at the Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel.  
  Interest Expense, net.      Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively.  The approximate $0.1 million decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.2 million related to our dispositions in 2016 and 2015.  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized interest of approximately $0.1 million in connection with our equity method investment in Prospect Park, which is currently under development.  
  Real Estate Taxes  .    Real estate taxes were $1.2 million and $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our dispositions in 2016 and 2015 accounted for a decrease of approximately $0.4 million and was partially offset by increases of less than $0.1 million in our Same Store operations. 
  Property Management Fees  .    Property management fees, which are based on revenues, were $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and were composed of property management fees paid to unaffiliated third parties and our Property Manager.  
  Asset Management Fees  .    Asset management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and were composed of asset management fees paid to our Advisor and third parties with respect to our investments.  Asset management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include fees related to our disposed properties of less than $0.1 million, each. 
  General and Administrative Expenses.      General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.7 million and $1.1 million, respectively, and were composed of audit fees, legal fees, board of directors  fees, and other administrative expenses.  Decreases in legal fees, audit fees, and administrative service fees payable to the Advisor during the three months ended September 30, 2016 accounted for approximately $0.3 million of the overall $0.4 million decrease. 
  Depreciation and Amortization.      Depreciation and amortization for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $2.6 million and $3.5 million, respectively.  The decrease of $0.9 million during the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to our 2016 and 2015 dispositions.

Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt.      We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.5 million in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of the pay off in full of Lakewood Flat s existing indebtedness when we sold the property in September 2016.  The $0.5 million loss was composed of the write-off of deferred financing fees of $0.4 million and an early termination fee of $0.1 million.  We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million in the third quarter of 2015 as a result of the pay off in full of Wimberly s existing indebtedness when we sold the property in September 2015.  The $0.6 million loss was composed of the write-off of deferred financing fees of $0.3 million and an early termination fee of $0.3 million.   
  Gain on Sale of Real Estate.      During the third quarter of 2016, we recorded gains on sale of approximately $11.5 million and a deferred gain of approximately $1.2 million for Lakewood Flats, which sold on August 16, 2016.  During the three months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded gains on sale of approximately $17.5 million, which consists of $8.6 million for Holstenplatz, which was sold on September 1, 2015, and $8.9 million for Wimberly, which was sold on September 9, 2015.  As discussed in Note 7, Real Estate and Real Estate-Related Investments, the Company did not view the disposals of Lakewood Flats, Holstenplatz, or Wimberly as a strategic shift and the results of operations are presented in continuing operations.  
     Income Tax Expense.      During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a provision for income tax of approximately $1 million as a result of foreign income tax related to the sale of Holstenplatz.  The foreign income tax was calculated on gains recognized at the exchange rate in effect on the sale date of September 1, 2015 and calculated using current tax rates.  We had less than $0.1 million income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2016, related to the difference in actual income taxes due and the originally estimated income taxes payable on the sale of Holstenplatz.

Continuing Operations 
  Our results of operations for the respective periods presented reflect decreases in most categories.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had decreases in rental revenue and property operating expenses of $4.7 million and $1.6 million, respectively, from the impact of our dispositions in 2016 and 2015.  Management expects decreases in most categories in the future as we dispose of additional real estate and real estate-related assets.  We are not actively seeking to purchase additional assets at this time, but may invest capital in our current assets in order to position them for sale in the normal course of business.   
  Revenues.      Revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, including Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel, were $35.5 million, a decrease of approximately $3.1 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  Same Store rental revenue (including our hotel revenue) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $31.4 million and $29.8 million, respectively.  Rental revenue from Lakewood Flats, disposed of in 2016, was $4.1 million and $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Rental revenue from Babcock, AJS, Holstenplatz, and Wimberly, disposed of in 2015, was $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  The change in revenue is primarily due to: 
             
    a decrease in rental revenue of $4.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of our 2016 and 2015 dispositions.  This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $1 million related to our Same Store operations; and 
                
    an increase in hotel revenue of $0.6 million, or 4.6%, at the Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel due to a 0.3% increase in ADR resulting in a 1.4% increase in RevPar period-over-period.  Occupancy increased 1.2% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015.  In addition, food and beverage revenue increased $0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
     Property Operating Expenses.      Property operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $7.1 million and $8.8 million, respectively.  The decrease of approximately $1.7 million was primarily due to a decrease of $1.6 million related to our dispositions in 2016 and 2015 and a decrease of $0.1 million related to our Same Store operations.  
  Hotel Operating Expenses.      Hotel operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $10.2 million and $9.4 million, respectively.  The increase in hotel operating expenses was primarily due to increases of $0.5 million in food and beverage costs and $0.2 million in sales and marketing costs incurred during 2016 at the Courtyard Kauai Coconut Beach Hotel.  
  Interest Expense, net.      Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $4.7 million and $5.3 million, respectively.  The approximate $0.6 million decrease was primarily due to our dispositions in 2016 and 2015.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we capitalized interest of approximately $0.1 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in connection with our equity method investment in Prospect Park, which is currently under development.  
  Real Estate Taxes  .    Real estate taxes were $4.1 million and $4.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Our dispositions in 2016 and 2015 accounted for a decrease of $0.7 million. 
  Property Management Fees  .    Property management fees, which are based on revenues, were $1.2 million and $1.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  These were composed of property management fees paid to unaffiliated third parties and our Property Manager.  
  Asset Management Fees  .    Asset management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $1.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, and were composed of asset management fees paid to our Advisor and third parties with respect to our investments.  Asset management fees for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include fees related to our disposed properties.  We expensed $0.3 million in asset management fees related to disposed properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  General and Administrative Expenses.      General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $2.2 million and $2.8 million, respectively, and were composed of audit fees, legal fees, board of directors  fees, and other administrative expenses.  The decrease of approximately $0.6 million during the first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to decreases of $0.3 million and $0.3 million in legal fees and administrative service fees payable to the Advisor, respectively.

Depreciation and Amortization.      Depreciation and amortization for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $8.4 million and $11.9 million, respectively.  The decrease of $3.5 million during the first nine months of 2016 was primarily due to a $3.8 million decrease related to our 2016 and 2015 dispositions.  This decrease was partially offset by a period-over-period increase of $0.3 million related to our Same Store operations. 
  Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt.      We recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the pay off in full of Lakewood Flat s existing indebtedness when we sold the property in September 2016.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded losses on early extinguishment of debt of $0.6 million and $0.1 million as a result of the pay off of debt on our Wimberly and AJS investments, which we sold in September 2015 and February 2015, respectively.   
  Gain on Sale of Real Estate.      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a gain on sale of approximately $11.5 million and a deferred gain of approximately $1.2 million for Lakewood Flats.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded gains on sale of $22.8 million related to our 2015 dispositions, which consists of $2 million for Babcock, $3.3 million for AJS, $8.6 million for Holstenplatz, and $8.9 million for Wimberly.  The gain on sale of AJS is net of a CTA of $0.6 million.  The gain on sale of Holstenplatz includes a CTA credit of $0.4 million.  As discussed in Note 7, Real Estate and Real Estate-Related Investments, the Company did not view the disposals of Lakewood Flats, Holstenplatz, Wimberly, Babcock, and AJS as a strategic shift and the results of operations are presented in continuing operations.  
  Income Tax Expense.      During the first quarter of 2015, we recorded a provision for income tax of approximately $2.2 million as a result of foreign income tax related to the sale of AJS.  The foreign income tax was calculated on gains recognized at the exchange rate in effect on the sale date of February 21, 2015 and calculated using current tax rates.  During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a credit of $0.5 million to the provision for income tax based on a change in the estimated taxes payable on the sale of AJS.  During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a provision for income tax of approximately $1 million as a result of foreign income tax related to the sale of Holstenplatz, resulting in a total income tax provision of $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The foreign income tax was calculated on gains recognized at the exchange rate in effect on the sale date of September 1, 2015 and calculated using current tax rates.  We had less than $0.1 million income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2016, related to the difference in actual income taxes paid and the originally estimated income taxes payable on the sale of Holstenplatz. 

Cash Flow Analysis 
  Nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.1 million compared to $5.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The primary reason for the decrease in cash flow from operating activities was the changes in working capital.  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by investing activities was $63.9 million compared to $74.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The year over year difference is primarily due to the $68.5 million of proceeds from the sale of Lakewood Flats during the first nine months of 2016 compared to $79.1 million from the sales of Babcock, AJS, Holstenplatz, and Wimberly during the first nine months of 2015.  
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in financing activities was $75.3 million compared to $73.6 million for the same period of 2015.  We paid special cash distributions to our stockholders totaling $38.4 million and $25.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid off the existing indebtedness totaling approximately $33.5 million associated with the Lakewood Flats investment, with proceeds from the sale.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we paid off the existing indebtedness totaling approximately $35.2 million associated with the Babcock, AJS, and Wimberly investments, with proceeds from the sales of the three investments.  In addition, we paid off the Holstenplatz debt of $8.1 million on April 30, 2015.  

Funds from Operations 
  Funds from operations ( FFO ) is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure of REIT operating performance.  We use FFO as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ) in the April 2002  White Paper of Funds From Operations  which is net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, and gains (or losses) from sales of property and impairments of depreciable real estate (including impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships which resulted from measurable decreases in the fair value of the depreciable real estate held by the joint venture or partnership), plus depreciation and amortization on real estate assets, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships, joint ventures,  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  

subsidiaries, and noncontrolling interests as one measure to evaluate our operating performance.  In October 2011, NAREIT clarified the FFO definition to exclude impairment charges of depreciable real estate (including impairments of investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and partnerships which resulted from measurable decreases in the fair value of the depreciable real estate held by the joint venture or partnership). 
  Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient.  As a result, our management believes that the use of FFO, together with the required GAAP presentations, provides a more complete understanding of our performance. 
  We believe that FFO is helpful to investors and our management as a measure of operating performance because it excludes depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions, impairments of depreciable assets, and extraordinary items, and as a result, when compared year to year, reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, development activities, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which is not immediately apparent from net income. 
  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), as an indication of our liquidity, nor as an indication of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions and should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements.  Additionally, the exclusion of impairments limits the usefulness of FFO as a historical operating performance measure since an impairment charge indicates that operating performance has been permanently affected.  FFO is not a useful measure in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value but not in determining FFO.  Our FFO as presented may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs that do not define these terms in accordance with the current NAREIT definition or that interpret the definition differently. 
  Our calculation of FFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is presented below (in thousands except per share amounts):   

_________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Includes our consolidated amount, as well as our pro rata share of those unconsolidated investments which we account for under the equity method of accounting, and the noncontrolling interest adjustment for the third-party partners  share. 
              (2) 
    The gain on sale of real estate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 is related to the sale of Lakewood Flats.  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, includes our proportionate share of the gain on sale of real estate related to our Holstenplatz and Wimberly investments.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, includes our proportionate share of the gain on sale of real estate related to the Babcock, AJS, Holstenplatz, and Wimberly investments.  The gain on sale of AJS is net of a cumulative foreign currency translation loss of approximately $0.6 million due to the substantial liquidation of AJS.  The gain on sale of Holstenplatz includes a CTA credit of approximately $0.4 million due to the substantial liquidation of Holstenplatz. 
              (3) 
    During the first quarter of 2015, we recorded an estimated provision for income tax of approximately $2.2 million as a result of foreign income tax related to the sale of AJS.  During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a credit of $0.5 million to the provision for income tax based on a change in the estimated taxes payable on the sale of AJS.  During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded an estimated provision for income tax of approximately $1 million as a result of foreign income tax related to the sale of Holstenplatz, resulting in a total income tax provision of $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  We had less than $0.1 million income tax benefit in the third quarter of 2016, related to the difference in actual income taxes due and the originally estimated income taxes payable on the sale of Holstenplatz.

     Table of Contents  

Provided below is additional information related to selected items included in net income above, which may be helpful in assessing our operating results. 
             
    Straight-line rental revenue was income of less than $0.1 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The noncontrolling interest portion of straight-line rental revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was income of less than $0.1 million. 
                
    Net above-market lease amortization of less than $0.1 million was recognized as a charge to rental revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Net below-market lease amortization of less than $0.1 million was recognized as an increase to rental revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The noncontrolling interest portion of the net above-market and net below-market lease amortization for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was less than $0.1 million. 
                
    Amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.1 million and $0.4 million was recognized as interest expense for our notes payable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  Amortization of deferred financing costs of $0.1 million and $0.5 million was recognized as interest expense for our notes payable for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
     In addition, cash flows generated from FFO may be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO, such as capital expenditures and payments of principal on debt, each of which may impact the amount of cash available for special distributions to our stockholders.    

Distributions  
  Distributions are authorized at the discretion of our board of directors based on its analysis of our performance over the previous periods and expectations of performance for future periods.  These analyses may include actual and anticipated operating cash flow, changes in market capitalization rates for investments suitable for our portfolio, capital expenditure needs, general financial and market conditions, proceeds from asset sales and other factors that our board deems relevant.  The board s decision will be substantially influenced by its obligation to ensure that we maintain our federal tax status as a REIT.  We cannot provide assurance that we will pay distributions at any particular level, or at all.  We expect that any future distributions authorized by our board of directors will be periodic, special distributions as opposed to regular monthly or quarterly distributions. 
  On November 20, 2015, our board of directors authorized a special cash distribution of $1.50 per share of common stock, payable to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2015.  The Company paid this special cash distribution of $38.4 million on January 5, 2016.  On March 18, 2015, our board of directors authorized a special cash distribution of $1.00 per share of common stock, payable to stockholders of record as of March 30, 2015.  This special cash distribution of $25.7 million was paid on March 31, 2015.  These special cash distributions represented a portion of proceeds from asset sales. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.  

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  On a regular basis, we evaluate these estimates, including investment impairment.  These estimates include such items as impairment of long-lived assets, depreciation and amortization, and allowance for doubtful accounts.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Our critical accounting policies and estimates have not changed significantly from the discussion found in the Management Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 16, 2016.

Item 3.      Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk 
  The Euro is the functional currency for the operations of AJS and Holstenplatz, which were sold in 2015.  As of September 30, 2016, we maintained approximately $8 million in Euro-denominated accounts, which are composed primarily of the remaining proceeds from the sale of these properties.  
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We may be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of long-term debt used to acquire properties and make loans and other permitted investments.  Our management s objectives, with regard to interest rate risks, are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs.  To achieve these objectives, we will borrow primarily at fixed rates or variable rates with the lowest margins available and in some cases, with the ability to convert variable rates to fixed rates.  With regard to variable rate financing, we will assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities.  We may enter into derivative financial instruments such as options, forwards, interest rate     swaps, caps, or floors to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate portion of our variable rate debt.  Of our $142.8 million in notes payable at September 30, 2016, $38 million represented debt subject to variable interest rates.  If our variable interest rates increased 100 basis points, we estimate that total annual interest cost, including interest expensed and interest capitalized, would increase by $0.4 million. 
  Our interest rate cap, which is classified as an asset, had a nominal fair value within prepaid expenses and other assets at September 30, 2016.  A 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would not result in a decrease in the fair value of our remaining interest rate cap.  A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an increase of less than $0.1 million in the fair value of our interest rate cap.  

Item 4.      Controls and Procedures. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated, as of September 30, 2016, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) using the criteria established in   Internal Control-New Integrated Framework (2013)   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of September 30, 2016, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in this report is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the rules and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  We believe, however, that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  There has been no change in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

OTHER INFORMATION    

Item 1.      Legal Proceedings. 
  We are not a party to, and none of our properties are subject to, any material pending legal proceedings. 

Item 1A.   Risk Factors. 
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

Item 2.      Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
  Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities 
  During the period covered by this quarterly report, we did not sell any equity securities that were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933. 
  Share Redemption Program  
  Our board of directors has adopted a share redemption program that permits stockholders to sell their shares back to us, subject to the significant conditions and limitations of the program.  Our board of directors can amend the provisions of our share redemption program at any time without the approval of our stockholders. 
  The terms on which we redeem shares may differ between redemptions upon a stockholder s death,  qualifying disability  (as defined in the share redemption program) or confinement to a long-term care facility (collectively, Exceptional Redemptions) and all other redemptions, or Ordinary Redemptions.  
  Any shares approved for redemption will be redeemed on a periodic basis as determined from time to time by our board of directors, and no less frequently than annually.  We will not redeem, during any 12-month period, more than 5% of the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the 12-month period immediately prior to the date of redemption.  In addition, the cash available for redemptions is limited to no more than $10 million in any twelve-month period.  The redemption limitations apply to all redemptions, whether Ordinary or Exceptional Redemptions. 
  The per share redemption price for Ordinary Redemptions and Exceptional Redemptions is equal to the lesser of 80% and 90%, respectively, of (i) the current estimated per share value and (ii) the average price per share the investor paid for all of his shares (as adjusted for any stock dividends, combinations, splits, recapitalizations and the like with respect to our common stock) less the Special Distributions (as defined in the share redemption program).   
  Effective November 20, 2015, our estimated value per share was $9.19.  As of December 31, 2015, the estimated value per share of our common stock was reduced by $1.50 per share, from $9.19 to $7.69, in accordance with the valuation policy to take into account the special cash distribution authorized by our board of directors on November 20, 2015, paid to stockholders of record as of December 31, 2015 on January 5, 2016.  As a result, the redemption price for shares redeemed after December 31, 2015 will be based on the estimated value per share, as adjusted, of $7.69.  For a full description of the methodologies used to estimate the value of our common stock as of October 31, 2015, see Part II, Item 5,  Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities-Market Information  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Notwithstanding the redemption prices set forth above, our board of directors may determine, whether pursuant to formulas or processes approved or set by our board of directors, the redemption price of the shares, which may differ between Ordinary Redemptions and Exceptional Redemptions; provided, however, that we must provide at least 30 days  notice to stockholders before applying this new price determined by our board of directors. 
  Any redemption requests are honored pro rata among all requests received based on funds available and are not honored on a first come, first served basis.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our board of directors redeemed all 44 Ordinary Redemption requests received that complied with the applicable requirements and guidelines of the share redemption program for an aggregate of 84,128 shares redeemed for $0.4 million (approximately $5.16 per share).  All redemptions were funded with cash on hand.

All redemptions were funded with cash on hand. 
  During the third quarter ended September 30, 2016, we redeemed shares as follows (including both Ordinary Redemptions and Exceptional Redemptions):
