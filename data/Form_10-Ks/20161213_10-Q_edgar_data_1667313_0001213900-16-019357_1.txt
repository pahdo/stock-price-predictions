 (Unaudited) 

Note 1 Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited consolidated
financial statements of Zedge, Inc. and its subsidiaries, Zedge Europe AS and Zedge Canada, Inc. (the  Company ) have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP )
for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do
not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of
management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.
Operating results for the three months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected
for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2017. The balance sheet at July 31, 2016 has been derived from the Company s audited
financial statements at that date but does not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete
financial statements. For further information, please refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended July 31, 2016, as filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC ). 

The Company was formerly a majority-owned subsidiary
of IDT Corporation ( IDT ). On June 1, 2016, IDT s interest in the Company was spun-off by IDT to IDT s
stockholders and the Company became an independent public company through a pro rata distribution of the Company s common
stock held by IDT to IDT s stockholders (the  Spin-Off ). 

The Company s fiscal year ends on July 31
of each calendar year. Each reference below to a fiscal year refers to the fiscal year ending in the calendar year indicated (e.g.,
fiscal 2017 refers to the fiscal year ending July 31, 2017). 

Note 2 Fair Value Measurements 

The following tables present the balance of assets
and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

(1)   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

 (2)   observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets and liabilities 

 (3)   no observable pricing inputs in the market 

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments 

The Company s other financial instruments at
October 31, 2016 and July 31, 2016 included trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and due to IDT Corporation. The
carrying amounts of the trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable and due to IDT Corporation balances approximated fair
value due to their short-term nature. This fair value estimate was classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

Note 3 Derivative Instruments 

The primary risk managed by the Company
using derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. Foreign exchange forward contracts are entered into as hedges against unfavorable
fluctuations in the U.S. Dollar - NOK exchange rate. Subsequent to the Spin-Off, IDT is providing hedging services to Zedge pursuant
to the Transition Services Agreement until such time Zedge is able to enter into foreign exchange contracts (see Notes 7 and 8).
The Company does not apply hedge accounting to these contracts; therefore the changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. By
using derivative instruments to mitigate exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates, the Company is exposed to credit risk
from the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the contract. The credit or repayment risk is minimized by entering
into transactions with high-quality counterparties. 

The outstanding contracts at October 31, 2016 were
as follows: 

The fair value of outstanding derivative instruments
recorded as assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were as follows:

Note 4 Accrued Expenses 

Accrued expenses consist of the following: 

Note 5 Equity 

Changes in the components of stockholders 
equity were as follows: 

Stock Options 

In the three months ended October 31,
2016, the Company received proceeds of $67,579 from the exercise of stock options for which the Company issued 48,299 shares of
its Class B common stock. In addition, in the three months ended October 31, 2016, the Company received proceeds of $56,840 from
the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2016 which was recorded as a receivable as of July 31, 2016. 

In September 2016, the Compensation
Committee of the Company s Board of Directors approved an equity grant of options to purchase 231,327 shares of the Company s
Class B common stock to its executive officers, a consultant and a non-executive employee. The options vest over a three year period.
Unrecognized compensation expense related to this grant was an aggregate of $681,000 based on the estimated fair value of the options
on the grant date. The unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. 

Note 6 Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing
net income attributable to all classes of common stockholders of the Company by the weighted average number of shares of all classes
of common stock outstanding during the applicable period. Diluted earnings per share is computed in the same manner as basic earnings
per share, except that the number of shares is increased to include restricted stock still subject to risk of forfeiture and to
assume exercise of potentially dilutive stock options using the treasury stock method, unless the effect of such increase is anti-dilutive. 

The weighted-average number of shares used in the
calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to the Company s common stockholders consists of the following: 

The following outstanding stock options were excluded
from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price of the stock option was greater than the average
market price of the Company s stock during the period: 

Note 7 Related Party Transactions 

Prior
to the Spin-Off, IDT charged the Company for certain transactions and allocated routine expenses based on company specific items
covered under a Master Services Agreement. This agreement provided for, among other things: (1) the allocation between the Company
and IDT of costs of employee benefits, taxes and other liabilities and obligations; (2) services provided by IDT relating to human
resources and employee benefits administration; and (3) finance, accounting, tax, facilities and legal services to be provided
by IDT to the Company. Following the Spin-Off, IDT charges the Company for services it provides pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement. The services provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement include human resources, payroll, investor relations,
legal, accounting, tax, financial systems, management consulting and foreign exchange risk management. The Transition Services
Agreement has a twelve month term with automatic renewals for additional six month terms unless terminated by either party upon
90 days  notice prior to the end of the then-current term. IDT s charges are included in  Selling, general and
administrative expense  in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  

Note 8 Revolving Credit Facility 

As of September 27, 2016, the Company
entered into a loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank for a revolving credit facility of up to $2.5 million. Advances
under this facility may not exceed the lesser of $2.5 million or 80% of the Company s eligible accounts receivable subject
to certain concentration limits. The revolving credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of the Company s
assets. The outstanding principal amount bears interest per annum at the greater of 3.5% or the prime rate plus 1.25%. Interest
is payable monthly and all outstanding principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due on the maturity date of September 27,
2018. The Company is required to pay an annual facility fee of $12,500 to Western Alliance Bank. The Company is also required to
comply with various affirmative and negative covenants as well as maintain certain financial ratios during the term of the revolving
credit facility. The covenants include a prohibition on the Company paying any dividend on its capital stock. The Company may terminate
this agreement at any time without penalty or premium provided that it pays down any outstanding principal, accrued interest and
bank expenses. At October 31, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and the Company was in
compliance with all of the covenants. 

As of November 16, 2016, the
Company entered into a Foreign Exchange Agreement with Western Alliance Bank to allow the Company to enter into foreign exchange
contracts not to exceed $5.0 million under its revolving credit facility.  The available
borrowing under the revolving credit facility shall be reduced by an applicable foreign exchange reserve percentage as determined
by  Western Alliance  Bank, in its reasonable discretion from time to time,
which shall initially be 10%.   

Note 9 Business Segment and Geographic Information 

The Company provides a content distribution platform,
worldwide, centered on self-expression, attracting both creators looking to promote their content and consumers who utilize such
content to express their identity, feelings, tastes and interests. The Company s platform enables consumers to personalize
their mobile devices with free, high quality ringtones, wallpapers, home screen app icons and notification sounds. The Company
conducts business as one operating segment. There were no revenues from customers located outside of the United States in all
periods presented. 

Net long-lived assets and total assets held outside
of the United States, which are located primarily in Norway, were as follows: 

Note 10  Legal Proceeding and Tax Matters 

Legal Proceedings 

In March 2014, Saregama India, Limited
filed a lawsuit against the Company before the Barasat District Court, seeking approximately $1,595,700 as damages and an injunction
for copyright infringement. The main ground for the lawsuit was an allegation that the Company avails the plaintiff s sound
recordings through the Company s platform with full knowledge that the sound recordings have been uploaded and are being
communicated to the public without obtaining any license from the plaintiff. The Company believes that material liability on the
matter is remote. 

The Company may from time to time be
subject to other legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Although there can be no assurance in this regard,
the Company does not expect any of those legal proceedings to have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of
operations, cash flows or financial condition. 

Tax Audits  

In September 2016, the Company was notified that
the Zedge Europe AS tax returns for 2013 and 2014 were going to be audited by the tax authorities in Norway. The initial audit
meeting took place in October 2016 and preliminary information was provided. No significant issues have been identified at this
time. Amounts asserted by taxing authorities or the amount ultimately assessed against the Company could be greater than any accrued
amount. Accordingly, provisions may be recorded in the future as estimates are revised or underlying matters are settled or resolved.
Imposition of assessments as a result of tax audits could have an adverse effect on the Company s results of operations,
cash flows and financial condition. 

Research and Development Credits  

As of October 31, 2016, the Company
has recorded a $0.2 million receivable from Norway s SkatteFUNN government program designed to stimulate research and development
in Norwegian trade and industry, which related to previous periods. 

Note 11 Recently Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted 

In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued an Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) that changes the impairment model for most
financial assets and certain other instruments. For receivables, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use
a new forward-looking  expected loss  model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for
losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar
to current practice, except the losses will be recognized as allowances instead of reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.
In addition, an entity will have to disclose significantly more information about allowances, credit quality indicators and past
due securities. The new provisions will be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings. The Company will adopt
the new standard on August 1, 2020. The Company is evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on its consolidated financial
statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to improve
the accounting for employee share-based payments. The new standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based
payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt the new standard on August 1, 2017. The Company is evaluating the impact
that the new standard will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU related
to the accounting for leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to
record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be
classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.
The Company will adopt the new standard on August 1, 2019. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees
for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented
in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. The Company is evaluating the impact that the new standard
will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

In May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting
Standards Board jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede most of the current revenue
recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP and IFRS. The goals of the revenue recognition project were to clarify and converge the revenue
recognition principles under U.S. GAAP and IFRS and to develop guidance that would streamline and enhance revenue recognition
requirements. To accomplish this objective, the standard requires five basic steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer,
(ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction
price to the performance obligations in the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance
obligation. The Company will adopt this standard on August 1, 2018. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective
or modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the standard. The Company is evaluating the impact that the standard will
have on its consolidated financial statements.

Play store in the U.S. for the past seven years and in the top 15 most popular free apps in the iTunes Entertainment category.
We have grown our user base without material investment in marketing, user acquisition or advertising.  

We
generate over 90% of our revenues from selling our advertising inventory to advertising networks/exchanges, real time bidding
platforms, and game publishers. Advertising networks/exchanges are technology platforms that facilitate the buying and selling
of media advertising inventory from multiple ad networks. Advertisers are attracted to us because of our sizable and growing user
base and associated demographics and our focus on mobile phone personalization. The remainder of our revenue is primarily generated
from managing and optimizing advertising inventory for a third-party app publisher, as well as revenue billing, collection and
reporting with respect to the advertising.  

A
key element in maintaining our position is our ability to meet user s expectations which necessitates retaining employees
with solid educational and professional credentials who are passionate about us and our mission to serve as a medium for self-expression.  

We
must offer advertisers exposure to an active and engaged user base with attractive demographic characteristics.  

Our
ability to continue to present advertisers with a compelling platform depends on continued growth of our user base, increased
app usage and improved retention, which will require ongoing investment in product and technology and increased marketing efforts.
Our growth plan also depends on improved monetization techniques and selective strategic investments and acquisitions.  

We
believe that our business model is scalable and allows for significant portions of revenue growth to flow to our bottom line.  

We
were formerly a majority-owned subsidiary of IDT Corporation, or IDT. On June 1, 2016, IDT s interest in Zedge was spun-off
by IDT to IDT s stockholders and we became an independent public company through a pro rata distribution of our common stock
held by IDT to IDT s stockholders (the Spin-Off).  

Critical
Accounting Policies  

Our
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated
financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016. The preparation of financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as
well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of
management s most subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change
in subsequent periods. Our critical accounting policies include those related to capitalized software and technology development
costs, revenue recognition and goodwill. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. For additional discussion of our critical accounting policies, see our Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal 2016.  

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted  

In
June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, that changes the
impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For receivables, loans and other instruments, entities
will be required to use a new forward-looking  expected loss  model that generally will result in the earlier recognition
of allowance for losses. For available-for-sale debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in
a manner similar to current practice, except the losses will be recognized as allowances instead of reductions in the amortized
cost of the securities. In addition, an entity will have to disclose significantly more information about allowances, credit quality
indicators and past due securities. The new provisions will be applied as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings.
We will adopt the new standard on August 1, 2020. We are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated
financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments. The new standard simplifies several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards
as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. We will adopt the new standard on August 1,
2017. We are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU related to the accounting for leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use, or ROU,
model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer
than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense
recognition in the income statement. We will adopt the new standard on August 1, 2019. A modified retrospective transition approach
is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative
period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact
that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  

In
May 2014, the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard
that will supersede most of the current revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards,
or IFRS. The goals of the revenue recognition project were to clarify and converge the revenue recognition principles under U.S.
GAAP and IFRS and to develop guidance that would streamline and enhance revenue recognition requirements. To accomplish this objective,
the standard requires five basic steps: (i) identify the contract with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations
in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in
the contract, and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We will adopt this standard
on August 1, 2018. Entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach for the adoption
of the standard. We are evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.  

Results
of Operations  

Three
Months Ended October 31, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended October 31, 2015  

nm not
meaningful  

Revenues.
 Revenues decreased in the three months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2015 primarily
due to a 10.7% decrease in our average revenue per monthly active user, or ARPMAU, to $0.0233 in three months ended October 31,
2016 from $0.0261 in the three months ended October 31, 2015. The ARPMAU decrease was primarily due to our app being temporarily
removed from the iTunes Store in late January 2016 which lowered the revenue per user that we were able to generate as well as
our decision to reduce our investments in Game Channel in mid-April 2016, which resulted in a decline in game installs where we
are paid on a  cost per install  basis. The ARPMAU decrease was partially offset by growth of both Android and iOS
users. Monthly Active Users, or MAU, increased by 2.6% to 31.6 million at October 31, 2016 from 30.8 million at October 31, 2015.
MAU is a performance indicator that captures the number of unique users that opened our app in the previous 30-day period. Our
install count, that is the number of times the Zedge app has been installed on devices, increased to 230.5 million at October
31, 2016 from 173.8 million a year ago.  

The
Zedge ringtones offering was re-introduced in iTunes in November 2016 in the U.S. and Canada before being released globally in
December 2016. The new app was the culmination of our goal re-introducing our ringtone offering (modified to comply with iTunes
requirements) to iPhone users after Apple pulled our Wallpaper and Ringtones app from the iTunes Store in January 2016. The new
app complements our existing Wallpaper app for iPhones that was launched in March 2016.  

Direct
cost of revenues . The increase in direct cost of revenues in the three months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the three
months ended October 31, 2015 was attributable to the fees that we pay to third parties that provide us with internet hosting,
content filtering and marketing automation services. The costs associated with content filtering and push notification marketing
increased as a result of a new product offering from one of our vendors and because of expanding the addressable customer base
that benefits from marketing automation services, respectively.  

Selling,
general and administrative expense .  Selling, general and administrative expense consists mainly of payroll, benefits,
facilities, marketing, content acquisition and consulting and professional fees. The increase in selling, general and administrative
expense in the three months ended October 31, 2016 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2015 was mostly due to increases
in accounting, tax and legal fees, which increased an aggregate of $0.2 million in the three months ended October 31, 2016 compared
to the three months ended October 31, 2015. In addition, payroll and benefits expense decreased in the three months ended October
31, 2016 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2015 due to the recording, in the three months ended October 31, 2016,
of a $0.2 million receivable from Norway s SkatteFUNN government program designed to stimulate research and development
in Norwegian trade and industry, which related to previous periods. Our headcount increased from 51 employees at October 31, 2015
to 59 employees at October 31, 2016.  

Selling,
general and administrative expense included stock-based compensation expense of $27,000 and $6,000 in the three months ended October
31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At October 31, 2016, unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock-based compensation
was an aggregate of $713,000. The unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining
vesting period that ends in 2019. In September 2016, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved an equity grant
of options to purchase 231,327 shares of our Class B common stock to our executive officers, a consultant and a non-executive
employee. The options vest over a three year period. Unrecognized compensation expense related to this grant was an aggregate
of $681,000 based on the estimated fair value of the options on the grant date.  

While
many of the costs of being a public company were already borne by us either directly or by allocation of corporate overhead from
IDT, we need to have the proper infrastructure in place to perform the necessary, legal, treasury, accounting, internal audit
and reporting functions. We anticipate our total costs will increase by $750,000 to $900,000 per year as a result of the Spin-Off.
Several of the costs included in this estimated range are preliminary, subject to negotiation, and may vary from the estimates
when finalized.  

Depreciation
and amortization . Depreciation and amortization consists mainly of amortization of capitalized software and technology
development costs of our internal developers on various projects that we invested in specific to the various platforms on which
we operate our service.  

Write-off
of capitalized software and technology development costs . In the three months ended October 31, 2016, we decided not to launch
a project that was in development. Since this abandoned project did not have any future benefit, we charged the capitalized software
and technology development costs for the project to expense.  

Net
gain (loss) resulting from foreign exchange transactions . Net gain (loss) resulting from foreign exchange transactions
are comprised of gains and losses generated from movements in Norwegian Krone, or NOK, relative to the U.S. Dollar. In addition,
in the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, we had gains of $67,000 and losses of $102,000, respectively, from NOK hedging
activities.  

Provision
for income taxes .  The decrease in the provision for income taxes in the three months ended October 31, 2016 compared
to the three months ended October 31, 2015 was due to the jurisdiction in which income was earned in the three months ended October
31, 2016 compared to the three months ended October 31, 2015 and our ability to use net operating losses in those jurisdictions.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources  

General  

At
October 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.0 million and working capital (current assets less current liabilities)
of $6.1 million. We currently expect that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, and our cash from operations will be sufficient
to meet our anticipated cash requirements during the twelve months ending October 31, 2017.  

Operating
Activities  

Our
cash flow from operations varies significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, depending on our operating results
and the timing of operating cash receipts and payments, specifically trade accounts receivable and trade accounts payable. Cash
provided by operating activities in the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to the continued growth
in our revenues. We anticipate that our total operating costs will increase by $750,000 to $900,000 per year as a result of being
a public reporting company. Several of the costs included in this estimated range are preliminary, subject to negotiation, and
may vary from the estimates when finalized.  

In
September 2016, we were notified that the Zedge Europe AS tax returns for 2013 and 2014 were going to be audited by the tax authorities
in Norway. The initial audit meeting took place in October 2016 and preliminary information was provided. No significant issues
have been identified at this time. Amounts asserted by taxing authorities or the amount ultimately assessed against us could be
greater than the accrued amount. Accordingly, provisions may be recorded in the future as estimates are revised or underlying
matters are settled or resolved. Imposition of assessments as a result of tax audits could have an adverse effect on our results
of operations, cash flows and financial condition.  

Investing
Activities  

Cash
used in investing activities in the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 consisted mostly of capitalized software and
technology development costs related to various projects that we invested in specific to the various platforms on which we operate
our service.  

Financing
Activities  

We
received proceeds of $67,579 from the exercise of stock options in the three months ended October 31, 2016 for which we issued
48,299 shares of our Class B common stock. In addition, in the three months ended October 31, 2016, we received proceeds of $56,840
from the exercise of stock options in fiscal 2016 which was recorded as a receivable as of July 31, 2016. No stock options were
exercised in the three months ended October 31, 2015.  

As
of September 27, 2016, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Western Alliance Bank for a revolving credit facility
of up to $2.5 million. Advances under this facility may not exceed the lesser of $2.5 million or 80% of our eligible accounts
receivable subject to certain concentration limits. The revolving credit facility is secured by a lien on substantially all of
our assets. The outstanding principal amount bears interest per annum at the greater of 3.5% or the prime rate plus 1.25%. Interest
is payable monthly and all outstanding principal and any accrued and unpaid interest is due on the maturity date of September
27, 2018. We are required to pay an annual facility fee of $12,500 to Western Alliance Bank. We are also required to comply with
various affirmative and negative covenants as well as maintain certain financial ratios during the term of the revolving credit
facility. The covenants include a prohibition on us not paying any dividend on our capital stock. We may terminate this agreement
at any time without penalty or premium provided that we pay down any outstanding principal, accrued interest and bank expenses.
At October 31, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all
of the covenants.  

As
of November 16, 2016, we entered into a Foreign Exchange Agreement with Western Alliance Bank to allow us to enter into foreign
exchange contracts not to exceed $5.0 million under our revolving credit facility. The available borrowing under the revolving
credit facility shall be reduced by an applicable foreign exchange reserve percentage as determined by Western Alliance Bank,
in its reasonable discretion from time to time, which shall initially be 10%.  

We
do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock until we achieve sustainable profitability and retain certain minimum cash
reserves. The payment of dividends in any specific period will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors.  

Changes
in Trade Accounts Receivable  

Gross
trade accounts receivable were $1.7 million at October 31, 2016 and $1.7 million at July 31, 2016. Our cash collections during
the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 were $2.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk and Significant Customers  

Historically,
we have had very little or no bad debt, which is common with other platforms of our size that derive their revenue from digital
advertising, as we aggressively manage our collections and perform due diligence on our customers. In addition, the majority of
our revenue is derived from large, credit-worthy customers (e.g. MoPub (owned by Twitter), Millennial Media (owned by AOL, which
is owned by Verizon), Google, Facebook, and Amazon) and we terminate our services with smaller customers immediately upon balances
becoming past due. Since these smaller customers rely on us to derive their own revenue, they generally pay their outstanding
balances on a timely basis.  

In
the three months ended October 31, 2016, three customers represented 52%, 15% and 13% of our revenue, and in the three months
ended October 31, 2015, two customers represented 46%, and 24% of our revenue. At October 31, 2016, one customer represented 63%
of our accounts receivable balance, and at July 31, 2016, one customer represented 62% of our accounts receivable balance. All
of these significant customers were advertising exchanges operated by leading companies, and the receivables represent many smaller
amounts due from advertisers.  

Contractual
Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments  

Smaller
reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements  

At
October 31, 2016, we did not have any  off-balance sheet arrangements,  as defined in relevant SEC regulations that
are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources, other than the following.  

In
connection with our Spin-Off, we and IDT entered into various agreements prior to the Spin-Off including a Separation and Distribution
Agreement to effect the separation and provide a framework for our relationship with IDT after the Spin-Off, and a Tax Separation
Agreement, which sets forth the responsibilities of us and IDT with respect to, among other things, liabilities for federal, state,
local and foreign taxes for periods before and including the Spin-Off, the preparation and filing of tax returns for such periods
and disputes with taxing authorities regarding taxes for such periods. Pursuant to Separation and Distribution Agreement, among
other things, we indemnify IDT and IDT indemnifies us for losses related to the failure of the other to pay, perform or otherwise
discharge, any of the liabilities and obligations set forth in the agreement. Pursuant to the Tax Separation Agreement, among
other things, IDT indemnifies us from all liability for taxes of ours and any of our subsidiaries or relating to our business
with respect to taxable periods ending on or before the Spin-Off, and we indemnify IDT from all liability for taxes of ours and
any of our subsidiaries or relating to our business accruing after the Spin-Off. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we are responsible
for, and IDT has no obligation to indemnify us for, any tax liability of ours resulting from an audit, examination or other proceeding
related to any tax returns that relate solely to us and our subsidiaries regardless of whether such tax return relates to a period
prior to or following the Spin-Off.  

Item 3. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks  

Smaller
reporting companies are not required to provide the information required by this item.  

Item 4. Controls
and Procedures  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.  Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended), as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 31,
2016.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
during the quarter ended October 31, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting. In addition, we have begun the process of documenting, reviewing and, as appropriate, improving
our internal controls and procedures in anticipation of becoming subject to the SEC rules concerning internal control over financial
reporting, which take effect beginning with the filing of our second Annual Report on Form 10-K (which will be due in October
2017).
