FOUR OAKS FINCORP, INC. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                 

NOTE A - BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  The organization and business of Four Oaks Fincorp, Inc., a bank holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of North Carolina (the "Company"), accounting policies followed by the Company, and other information are contained in the notes to the consolidated financial statements filed as part of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . This Quarterly Report should be read in conjunction with such Annual Report. 
    
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.  In management s opinion, the financial information contained in the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements reflects all adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the financial information as of and for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts and transactions of the Company, and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Four Oaks Bank   Trust Company (the "Bank").  Operating results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending   December 31, 2016  .  
    
  Certain amounts previously presented in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current classifications.  All such reclassifications had no impact on the prior periods' Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Income, or Shareholders' Equity as previously reported. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which addresses eight specific classification issues in an effort to reduce the diversity in practice in how these certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.    
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  .  This update replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology with one that reflects current expected credit losses (CECL) and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable forecasted information to inform credit loss estimates.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.    
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  This update amends several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  The adoption of this guidance is not believed to be material to the Company's financial statements.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , which will require lessees to be recorded as an asset on the balance sheet for the right to use the leased asset and a liability for the corresponding lease obligation for leases with terms of more than 12 months. The accounting treatment for lessors will remain relatively unchanged. The ASU also requires additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures related to the nature, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.   

-  9  - 

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  , which revises the accounting treatment related to classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.  Upon adoption, investments in equity securities, except those accounted for under the equity method or that result in the consolidation of the investee, will be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  Equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value may be measured at cost minus impairment, plus or minus changes from observable price changes in an orderly transaction.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption of certain provisions is permitted.  The Company does not believe the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.    This update requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  The existing recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by this update.  ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015.  We adopted ASU No. 2015-03 and there was no impact to the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),   which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , and most industry-specific guidance on revenue recognition throughout the ASC. The new standard is principles based and provides a five step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized.  The core principle of the new standard is that revenue should be recognized when a company transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  The new standard also requires disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information surrounding the amount, nature, timing and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.  On August 12, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date,   which defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. Based on ASU 2015-14, public organizations would apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date (i.e., interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016).  The Company continues to evaluate the impact of adopting the new standard on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  Other accounting standards that have been issued by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  From time to time the FASB issues exposure drafts for proposed statements of financial accounting standards. Such exposure drafts are subject to comment from the public, to revisions by the FASB and to final issuance by the FASB as statements of financial accounting standards. Management considers the effect of the proposed statements on the consolidated financial statements of the Company and monitors the status of changes to and proposed effective dates of exposure drafts.

NOTE B - NET INCOME PER SHARE   
    
  Basic net income per share represents earnings credited to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income per share reflects additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance.  Potential common shares that may be issued by the Company relate to outstanding stock options.  
    
  Basic and diluted net income per common share have been computed based upon net income as presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding or assumed to be outstanding as summarized below   (amounts in thousands, except share data)  :

NOTE C   INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
    
  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains, gross unrealized losses, and fair values of securities available-for-sale and securities held-to-maturity as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are as follows   (amounts in thousands)  : 

-  12  - 

The following tables show gross unrealized losses and fair values of investment securities, aggregated by investment category and length of time that the individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (amounts in thousands)  .  There were   no   unrealized losses on held to maturity securities at September 30, 2016. 

Management evaluates each quarter whether unrealized losses on securities represent impairment that is other than temporary.  For debt securities, the Company considers its intent to sell the securities or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities.  If such impairment is identified, based upon the intent to sell or the more likely than not threshold, the carrying amount of the security is reduced to fair value with a charge to earnings. Upon the result of the aforementioned review, management then reviews for potential other than temporary impairment based upon other qualitative factors.  In making this evaluation, management considers changes in market rates relative to those available when the security was acquired, changes in market expectations about the timing of cash flows from securities that can be prepaid, performance of the debt security, and changes in the market's perception of the issuer's financial health and the security's credit quality.  If it is determined that a debt security has incurred other than temporary impairment, then the amount of the credit related impairment is determined.  If a credit loss is evident, the amount of the credit loss is charged to earnings and the non-credit related impairment is recognized through other comprehensive income.  
    
  The unrealized gains and losses on securities at   September 30, 2016   resulted from changing market interest rates compared to the yields available at the time the underlying securities were purchased.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   1   of   54   Government National Mortgage Association ("GNMA") mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") that contained a net unrealized loss.  Management identified no impairment related to credit quality.  For debt securities in an unrealized loss position, the Company does not intend to sell and it is not likely that the Company will be required to sell these securities before the anticipated recovery of the amortized cost basis.  As a result,   no   other than temporary impairment losses were recognized during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

-  13  - 

The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities at   September 30, 2016   by expected maturities are shown on the following table   (amounts in thousands)  . Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.  

Securities with a carrying value of approximately   $43.8 million   and   $61.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged to secure public deposits, borrowing lines, and for other purposes required or permitted by law.  Sales and calls of securities available-for-sale for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   of   $5.2 million   and   $8.3 million   generated net realized gains of   $266,000   and   $265,000  , respectively, and   no   gross realized losses for either period.  Sales and calls of securities available-for-sale for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   of   $4.7 million   generated net realized gains of   $209,000   and   no   gross realized losses for the period.  There were   no   sales and calls of securities available-for-sale for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

NOTE D   LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES  
    
  The Company has adopted comprehensive lending policies, underwriting standards and loan review procedures, which are reviewed on a regular basis.  Each class of loans is subject to risks that could have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the loan portfolio.  Loans are primarily made in the Company's market area in North Carolina, principally Johnston, Wake, Harnett, Duplin, and Sampson counties.  There have been no significant changes to the loan class definitions outlined in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  The classification of loan segments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are summarized as follows   (amounts in thousands)  : 

-  15  - 

Allowance for Loan Losses and Recorded Investment in Loans  
    
  The allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of an amount adequate to provide for known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio in the normal course of business.  Management evaluates the adequacy of this allowance on at least a quarterly basis, which includes a review of loans both specifically and collectively evaluated for impairment.  
    
  The following tables are an analysis of the allowance for loan losses by loan segment as of and for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   and as of and for the   twelve   months ended   December 31, 2015     (amounts in thousands)  .  

(1)      At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $239,000   in impaired loans collectively evaluated for impairment with   $34,000   in reserves established.  

-  16  - 

(1)      At   September 30, 2015  , there were   $416,000   impaired loans collectively evaluated for impairment with   $34,000   in reserves established.  

-  17  - 

(1)    At   December 31, 2015  , there were   $295,000   in impaired loans collectively evaluated for impairment with   $42,000   in reserves established.  
  
   -  18  - 

Credit Risk 
    
  The Company uses an internal grading system to assign the degree of inherent risk on each individual loan and monitors trends in portfolio quality.  The grade is initially assigned by the lending officer or credit administration and reviewed by the loan administration function throughout the life of the loan.  There have been no significant changes in credit grade definitions as outlined in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The following tables are an analysis of the creditworthiness by loan class and credit card portfolio exposure as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (amounts in thousands)  .

  The following tables are an age analysis of past due loans, including those on nonaccrual by loan class, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (amounts in thousands). 

Nonperforming assets 
    
  Nonperforming assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consist of the following   (amounts in thousands)  :

Troubled Debt Restructurings 
    
  Loans are classified as a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") when, for economic or legal reasons which result in a debtor experiencing financial difficulties, the Bank grants a concession through a modification of the original loan agreement that would not otherwise be considered.  Generally concessions are granted as a result of a borrower's inability to meet the contractual repayment obligations of the initial loan terms and in the interest of improving the likelihood of recovery of the loan.  We may grant these concessions by a number of means such as (1) forgiving principal or interest, (2) reducing the stated interest rate to a below market rate, (3) deferring principal payments, (4) changing repayment terms from amortizing to interest only, (5) extending the repayment period, or (6) accepting a change in terms based upon a bankruptcy plan.  However, the Bank only restructures loans for borrowers that demonstrate the willingness and capacity to repay the loan under reasonable terms and where the Bank has sufficient protection provided by the cash flow of the underlying collateral or business.     
    
  The Bank's policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a TDR process follows relevant supervisory guidance.  If a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is considered and the loan is considered performing.  If the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.  If the borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual and nonperforming until such time as continued performance has been demonstrated, which is typically a period of at least   six   consecutive payments.   
    
  The following table provides a summary of loans modified as TDRs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (amounts in thousands). 

-  23  - 

There were   six   new TDRs made to borrowers for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and there were   no   TDR loans modified during the previous   twelve   months that had a payment default for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .   

The table below details TDRs that the Bank has entered into during the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  .

  Commitments 
    
  The following table presents loan commitments at   September 30, 2016     (amounts in thousands)  . 

Pledged Assets  
    
  Certain assets are pledged to secure municipal deposits, borrowings, and borrowing capacity, subject to certain limits, at the FHLB and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the "FRB"), as well as for other purposes as required or permitted by law. FHLB borrowings are secured by securities and a floating lien covering the Company's loan portfolio of qualifying residential (1-4 units) first mortgage and commercial real estate loans. The following table provides the total market value of pledged assets by asset type at   September 30, 2016     (amounts in thousands)  . 

Litigation Proceedings 
    
  In October 2013, multiple putative class action lawsuits were filed in United States district courts across the country against a number of different banks based on the banks' alleged role in "payday lending". Four of these lawsuits, filed in the Northern District of Georgia, the Middle District of North Carolina, the District of Maryland, and the Southern District of Florida, named the Bank as one of the defendants. The lawsuits allege that, by processing Automatic Clearing House transactions indirectly on behalf of "payday" lenders, the Bank is illegally participating in an enterprise to collect unlawful debts and is therefore liable to plaintiffs for damages under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The lawsuits also allege a variety of state law claims. The Bank moved to dismiss each of these lawsuits. As previously reported, the Georgia action was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs and the District of Maryland granted the motion and dismissed the case, which the parties subsequently settled while on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Of the two remaining lawsuits, there are no updates to the lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida, which, as previously reported, has been stayed pending arbitration of the plaintiff's claims against the Bank's co-defendants. The Middle District of North Carolina granted the Bank s motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part; the case against the Bank has been stayed (except for limited discovery) pending an appeal by the Bank s co-defendants. 
    
  Additionally, the Company is party to certain legal actions in the ordinary course of its business.  The Company believes these actions are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of its business. While the outcome of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty, management s present judgment is that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. If, however, the Company's assessment of these actions is inaccurate, or there are any significant adverse developments in these actions, its business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be adversely affected.

NOTE G   FAIR VALUE     MEASUREMENT   
    
  Fair Value Measured on a Recurring Basis.       
    
  The Company measures certain assets at fair value on a recurring basis, as described below. 
    
  Investment Securities Available-for-Sale 
    
  Investment securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. Level 1 securities have historically included equity securities traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no Level 1 securities. Level 2 securities include taxable municipalities and mortgage-backed securities issued by government sponsored entities. The Company s mortgage-backed securities were primarily issued by GNMA, the Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA"), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC"). As of   September 30, 2016  , all of the Company s mortgage-backed securities were agency issued and designated as Level 2 securities. Securities classified as Level 3 include other debt securities in less liquid markets and with no quoted market price. 
    
  The following table presents information about assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (amounts in thousands)  . 

-  27  - 

The following table presents the reconciliation for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   for all Level 3 assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis   (amounts in thousands)  .  

Fair Value Measured on a Nonrecurring Basis.     
    
  The Company measures certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, as described below. 
    
  Loans Held for Sale  
    
  Loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or market value.  The fair value of loans held for sale is based on what secondary markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. As such, the Company classifies loans held for sale as a Level 2 valuation. 
    
  Impaired Loans  
    
  The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis.  However, when a loan is considered impaired, it is evaluated for impairment and written down to its estimated fair value or an allowance for loan losses is established. When the fair value of an impaired loan is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value with no adjustments, the Company records the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 2. When there is no observable market prices, an appraised value is not available, or the Company determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value, the impaired loan is classified as nonrecurring Level 3. 
    
  Foreclosed Assets 
    
  Foreclosed assets are adjusted to fair value less estimated selling costs upon transfer of the loans to foreclosed assets.  Subsequently, foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value.  Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral.  Given the lack of observable market prices for identical properties, the Company records foreclosed assets as non-recurring Level 3.  
    
  Assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis are included in the tables below at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (amounts in thousands). 

-  28  - 

Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following table presents the valuation methodology and unobservable inputs for Level 3 assets measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2016   (amounts in thousands, except percentages). 

Collateral discounts to determine fair value on impaired loans varies widely and result from the consideration of the following factors: the age of the most recent appraisal, the type of asset serving as collateral, the expected marketability of the asset, its material or environmental condition, and comparisons to actual sales data of similar assets from both internal and external sources.  
  The following table reflects the general range of collateral discounts for impaired loans by segment.                  Loan Segment: 
    Range of Percentages 
      Commercial construction and land development 
    10% - 40% 
      Commercial real estate 
    9% - 50% 
      Residential construction 
    9% - 30% 
      Residential mortgage 
    9% - 20% 
      All other segments 
    9% - 20% 

As foreclosed assets are brought into other real estate owned through a process which requires a fair market valuation, further discounts typically reflect market conditions specific to the asset.  These conditions are usually captured in subsequent appraisals which are required on an annual basis, and depending upon asset type and marketability demonstrate a more restrained variance than that noted above. 
  
   -  29  - 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
  The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents are equal to the fair value due to the liquid nature of the financial instruments. 
    
  Certificate of Deposits 
  These investments are valued at carrying amounts for fair value purposes. 
    
  Securities Available-for-Sale and Securities Held-to-Maturity 
  Fair values of investment securities are based on quoted market prices. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities. 
    
  Loans Held For Sale 
  The fair value of mortgage loans held for sale is based on commitments on hand from investors within the secondary market for loans with similar characteristics.  
    
  Loans 
  The fair value of loans has been estimated utilizing the net present value of future cash flows based upon contractual balances, prepayment assumptions, and applicable weighted average interest rates, adjusted for a   3%   current liquidity and market discount assumption. The Company has assigned no fair value to off-balance sheet financial instruments since they are either short term in nature or subject to immediate repricing. 
    
  FHLB Stock 
  The carrying amount of FHLB stock approximates fair value. 
    
  Deposits 
  The fair value of non-maturing deposits such as noninterest-bearing demand, money market, NOW, and savings accounts, are by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand. Fair value for maturing deposits such as CDs and IRAs are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach that applies current interest rates to expected maturities.   
    
  Borrowings, Subordinated Debentures, and Subordinated Promissory Notes 
  The fair value of borrowings, subordinated debentures, and subordinated promissory notes, is based on discounting expected cash flows at the interest rate from debt with the same or similar remaining maturities and collection requirements.   
    
  Accrued Interest Receivable and Payable 
  The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximates fair value.

NOTE H - CAPITAL   REGULATORY INFORMATION 
    
  North Carolina banking law requires that the Bank may not pay a dividend that would reduce its capital below the applicable required capital.  In addition, regulatory authorities may limit payment of dividends by any bank when it is determined that such a limitation is in the public interest and is necessary to ensure the financial soundness of the Bank.  Although not currently limited by regulatory authorities, there were   no   dividends paid to the Company by the Bank during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Current federal regulations require that the Company and the Bank maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of   8.0%  , with at least   6.0%   being in the form of Tier 1 capital, as defined in the regulations.  In addition, the Company and the Bank must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of   4.5%   and a leverage ratio of   4.0%  .  For the Bank to be categorized as well capitalized, the Bank must maintain minimum amounts and ratios as set forth in the table below.  There is no such category for well capitalized at the Company level.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank was classified as well capitalized for regulatory capital purposes.  
    
  Capital ratios for the Bank and the Company are presented in the table below. 

In July 2015, the Bank entered into a Written Agreement (the "2015 Written Agreement") with the FRB replacing the Written Agreement the Company and the Bank entered into with the FRB and the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks in 2011. Under the terms of the 2015 Written Agreement, the Bank submitted and implemented the following plans: 
    
     a written plan to assure ongoing board oversight of the Bank's management and operations;  
     a written program for the review of new products, services, or business lines; and 
             
    an enhanced written program for conducting appropriate levels of customer due diligence by the Bank.  
       
  In addition, the Bank agreed that it will within   30 days   after the end of each calendar quarter following the date of the 2015 Written Agreement, submit to FRB written progress reports detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the 2015 Written Agreement and the results thereof.

NOTE I - RESTRICTED STOCK  
    
  A summary of the activity of the Company's restricted stock awards   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   is presented below: 

The Company measures the fair value of restricted shares based on the price of the Company's common stock on the grant date, and compensation expense is recorded over the vesting period.  The related compensation expense recognized for restricted stock awards   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $225,000   and   $405,000  , respectively.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimates there was   $2.2 million   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stock granted under the plan.  That  cost is expected to be recognized over the next   three years  .  The grant-date fair value of restricted stock grants vested during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $1.53  .

ITEM 2   MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
    
  The following discussion provides information about the major components of the financial condition and results of operations of Four Oaks Fincorp, Inc. (the  Company ) and its subsidiaries and should be read in conjunction with the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.  Unless the context otherwise indicates, references in this report to "we," "us" and "our" refer to the Company and its subsidiaries.  

Comparison of Financial Condition at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015 
    
  The Company s total assets   increased     $31.5 million   or   4.6%   from   $691.4 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $722.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  Cash, cash equivalents, and investments were   $191.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $189.2 million   at   December 31, 2015  ,   an increase   of   $2.6 million   or   1.4%  .  Strong loan demand resulted in balance growth of   $31.1 million   or   6.8%   as outstanding gross loans grew to   $489.4 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $458.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  .   
    
  Total liabilities were   $657.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  ,   an increase   of   $26.9 million   or   4.3%  , from   $631.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Total deposits   increased     $17.9 million   or   3.3%   during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $542.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  , to   $560.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  Non-time deposits grew   $33.5 million   or    10.8%   to   $345.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $312.3 million   at   December 31, 2015   as we strive to reduce high cost time deposits for non-relationship customers.  Long-term borrowings were   $70.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $60.0 million   at   December 31, 2015  , an   increase   of   $10.0 million   or   16.7%  .  Total shareholders  equity   increased     $4.5 million   or   7.5%  , from   $60.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  , to   $64.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  

Results of Operations for the   Three Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  Net Income  .    Pre-tax net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.6 million   compared to   $826,000   for the same period in   2015  , an   increase   of   $755,000   or   91.4%  .  Net income for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $948,000  , or   $0.03   net income per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of   $734,000  , or   $0.02   net income per basic and diluted share, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  For the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company reported a provision for income taxes totaling   $633,000   compared to   $92,000   for the same period in 2015.  The year-over-year   $214,000   increase in net income was due to a number of factors including an increase in net interest income and reductions in non-interest expense, offset by a decrease in non-interest income and an increase in income tax expense.  
    
  Net Interest Income.    Net interest income is the difference between interest income, principally from loan and investment securities, and interest expense, largely on customer deposits and borrowings.  Changes in net interest income result from changes in volume, spread, and margin.  For this purpose, volume refers to the average dollar level of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest-earning assets and the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities, and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets.  Margin is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, as well as by levels of non-interest-bearing liabilities and capital. 
    
  Net interest income increased to   $6.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $5.6 million   as of this same period in   2015  , an   increase   of   $550,000  .  Interest income remained flat at   $7.4 million   for the third quarter of   2016   and 2015. Although interest income increased due to loan balance growth, this was offset by declines in investment portfolio balances and the absence of lost interest recoveries on nonaccrual loans compared to this same period in 2015.  Interest expense totaled   $1.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1.7 million   for the same period in 2015.  Interest expense for the period ended   September 30, 2016   improved   $558,000   as a result of the balance sheet strategies executed in 2015, which entailed reducing high cost Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") borrowings and refinancing the Company's subordinated debt.   Net interest margin improved 33 basis points to 3.76% for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to 3.43% for the same period ended   September 30, 2015  . 

-  34  - 

Provision for Loan Losses  .    The provision for loan losses is charged to bring the allowance for loan losses to the level deemed appropriate by management after adjusting for recoveries of amounts previously charged off.  Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.  The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and results from management s consideration of such factors as the financial condition of borrowers, past and expected loss experience, current economic conditions, and other factors management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , no provision for the allowance for loan losses was recognized in earnings.   
    
  Non-Interest Income.    Non-interest income   decreased     $337,000   to   $1.3 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $1.7 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  For the three months ended September 30, 2015, there was $309,000 in gains from the sale of loans and investments that were not present for the three months ended September 30, 2016, contributing to most of the decline in non-interest income.   
    
  Non-Interest Expense.    Non-interest expense   decreased     $542,000   to   $6.0 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $6.5 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2015  .  This decrease was largely attributable to declines in operating expenses of $229,000, collection expenses of $127,000, and FDIC insurance premiums of $109,000, as well as professional and consulting fees of $49,000.  These declines are a result of a continued focus on expense management, as well as improvements in asset quality measures, overall reductions in the number and amount of foreclosed assets, and the absence of technology conversion related expenses that were present during 2015. 
    
  Income Taxes.    The Company recorded a provision for income taxes totaling   $633,000   for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, as compared to   $92,000   for the same period in 2015.  The recorded income tax expense in the third quarter of 2015 was due to a reduction in the North Carolina state tax rate and its impact on the Company's deferred tax asset.  The North Carolina state tax rate was again reduced in 2016 and consequently the deferred tax asset was revalued, increasing tax expense for the third quarter of 2016 by approximately this same amount.

Results of Operations for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015 
    
  Net Income  .    Pre-tax net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.2 million compared to $2.7 million for the same period in 2015, an increase of $1.5 million or 56.2%.  Net income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $2.7 million  , or   $0.08   net income per basic and diluted share, as compared to net income of   $19.2 million  , or   $0.60   net income per basic and diluted share, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported a provision for income taxes totaling $1.6 million compared to an income tax benefit of $16.5 million for the same period in 2015.  The prior year income tax benefit resulted from the partial reversal of the valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets executed in the second quarter of 2015 and is consequently the main contributor to the year-over-year   $16.5 million     decrease   in net income. 
    
  Net Interest Income.    Net interest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $18.2 million  , as compared to   $17.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , an increase of   $1.2 million  .  Cost of funds continues to be favorable as compared to 2015 and improved $1.5 million for the nine month period ended   September 30, 2016  , which was primarily a result of the balance sheet strategies executed in 2015 that entailed reducing high cost long term borrowings and refinancing the Company's subordinated debt at lower rates.  This improvement in funding costs was partially offset by declines in interest income on investment securities due to declining balances and on loans as there was limited recovery of lost interest on nonaccrual loans compared to this same period in 2015.  Net interest margin improved 48 basis points to 3.73% for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 3.25% for the same period ended September 30, 2015. 
    
  Provision for Loan Losses  .    The provision for loan losses is charged to bring the allowance for loan losses to the level deemed appropriate by management after adjusting for recoveries of amounts previously charged off.  Loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.  The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and results from management's consideration of such factors as the financial condition of borrowers, past and expected loss experience, current economic conditions, and other factors management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve.  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , no provision for the allowance for loan losses was recognized in earnings. 
    
  Non-Interest Income.    Non-interest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $4.1 million  , as compared to   $4.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $813,000  .  The primary driver for the decline was the absence of $348,000 in ACH third party payment processor indemnification income as the Company exited this business line in 2015 and the absence of $100,000 from gains on sale of loans held for sale.  Additional factors contributing to the overall decline include reductions in service charges on deposit accounts and reduced premium income from the sale of government guaranteed loans. 
    
  Non-Interest Expenses.    Non-interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $18.0 million  , as compared to   $19.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , a   decrease   of   $1.2 million   with declines continuing in various expense categories as the Company strives to increase efficiency and reduce the overall expense base.  Ongoing improvements in asset quality led to declines in FDIC assessment rates, as well as collection and foreclosure related expenses.  Another contributor to the decline was the reduction in technology conversion related expenses that were present during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.    
    
  Income Taxes.    The Company began recording income tax expense during the first quarter of 2016 and reported a provision for income taxes totaling $1.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to an income tax benefit of $16.5 million for the same period in 2015, which resulted from the partial reversal of the valuation allowance against the Company's deferred tax assets executed in the second quarter of 2015.  Since the $16.6 million partial reversal of the valuation allowance in 2015, the Company has experienced continued improvements in quarterly earnings and asset quality.  These factors along with forecasted future profitability continue to support the Company's belief that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the remaining portion of its deferred tax asset.  The Company is in the process of evaluating a reversal of the remaining valuation allowance on its deferred tax asset.  If during this process the Company determines that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will be generated to realize the remaining portion of its deferred tax assets, we will move forward with the release of the remaining valuation allowance.

Asset Quality  
    
  Asset quality continued to improve during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .  The Company completed its asset resolution plan in 2015 and management believes problem assets are at a manageable level in which resolution can occur in the normal course of business.  Classified assets as of   September 30, 2016  , which include loans risk graded substandard or lower and foreclosed assets, totaled   $7.5 million   compared to   $10.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  ,   a decline   of   $2.6 million  .  The classified assets to capital ratio totaled   8.8%   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   12.5%   at year end   2015  .  
    
  Nonperforming Assets 
    
  Nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans, accruing loans which are past due 90 days or more, repossessed assets, and other real estate owned ("foreclosed assets").  As of   September 30, 2016  , nonperforming assets   declined     $2.5 million   or   29.9%   when compared to   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  The following table describes our nonperforming asset portfolio by loan class as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (amounts in thousands, except ratios)  . 

Nonaccrual Loans 
    
  Loans are moved to nonaccrual status and recognition of interest income ceases when it is probable that full collectibility of principal and interest in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement may not occur.  Nonaccrual loans as a percentage of gross loans   decreased   to   0.8%   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   1.4%   as of   December 31, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   30   nonaccrual loans totaling   $3.8 million   compared to   42   loans totaling   $6.6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The amount of interest income   for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016   that would have been reported on loans in nonaccrual status as of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $133,000  .  
  
   -  37  - 

Foreclosed Assets 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   28   foreclosed properties valued at a total of   $2.1 million   compared to   35   foreclosed properties valued at   $1.8 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . The primary driver of the increase in value of foreclosed properties was due to the addition of one property in the amount of $863,000 in the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  Troubled Debt Restructurings  
    
  Loans are classified as a troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") when, for economic or legal reasons which result in a debtor experiencing financial difficulties, the Bank grants a concession through a modification of the original loan agreement that would not otherwise be considered.  Generally concessions are granted as a result of a borrower's inability to meet the contractual repayment obligations of the initial loan terms and in the interest of improving the likelihood of recovery of the loan.  We may grant these concessions by a number of means such as (1) forgiving principal or interest, (2) reducing the stated interest rate to a below market rate, (3) deferring principal payments, (4) changing repayment terms from amortizing to interest only, (5) extending the repayment period, or (6) accepting a change in terms based upon a bankruptcy plan.  However, the Bank only restructures loans for borrowers that demonstrate the willingness and capacity to repay the loan under reasonable terms and where the Bank has sufficient protection provided by the cash flow of the underlying collateral or business.     
    
  The Bank's policy with respect to accrual of interest on loans restructured in a TDR process follows relevant supervisory guidance.  If a borrower has demonstrated performance under the previous loan terms and shows capacity to perform under the restructured loan terms, continued accrual of interest at the restructured interest rate is considered and the loan is considered performing.  If the borrower does not perform under the restructured terms, the loan is placed on nonaccrual status.  If the borrower was materially delinquent on payments prior to the restructuring but shows the capacity to meet the restructured loan terms, the loan will likely continue as nonaccrual and nonperforming until such time as continued performance has been demonstrated, which is typically a period of at least   six   consecutive payments.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   five   restructured loans in accrual status compared to   eight   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Regardless of whether any individual TDR is performing, all TDRs are considered to be impaired and are evaluated as such in the allowance for loan losses calculation.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the recorded investment in performing TDRs and their related allowance for loan losses totaled   $938,000   and   $0  , respectively.  Outstanding nonperforming TDRs totaled   $836,000   with   $41,000   in specific reserves as of   September 30, 2016  .  The amount of interest recognized for performing and nonperforming TDRs during the first   nine   months of   2016   were approximately   $45,000   and   $10,000  , respectively.   
    
  The following table presents performing and nonperforming TDRs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015     (amounts in thousands)  .

Allowance for Loan Losses and Summary of Loss Experience 
    
  The allowance for loan losses is established through periodic charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses.  Increases to the allowance for loan losses occur as a result of provisions charged to operations and recoveries of amounts previously charged-off, and decreases to the allowance occur when loans are charged-off because management believes that the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed.  Management evaluates the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis.  The evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses involves the consideration of loan growth, loan portfolio composition and industry diversification, historical loan loss experience, current delinquency levels, adverse conditions that might affect a borrower s ability to repay the loan, estimated value of underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions and all other relevant factors derived from our history of operations.  Additionally, regulatory agencies review our allowance for loan losses and may require additional provisions for estimated losses based on judgments that differ from those of management.    
    
  The following table summarizes the Company's loan loss experience by class for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015     (amounts in thousands, except ratios)  . 

The allowance for loan losses at   September 30, 2016   was   $9.7 million  , which represents   1.98%   of total loans held for investment compared to   $10.3 million   or   2.27%   as of   September 30, 2015  .  The decrease in amount and percentage to total loans is due to loan growth of   $31.1 million     for the nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  Additionally, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , recoveries outpaced charge-offs resulting in a net loan recovery of   $57,000   compared with net recoveries of   $895,000   for the prior year period.  
  
   -  39  - 

The allowance for loan losses on individually reviewed impaired loans totaled   $774,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.2 million   as of   December 31, 2015  , a   37%     decrease  .  The primary driver of the reduction is the absence of one relationship that was refinanced with additional collateral and removed from impaired status.  The allowance for loan losses on the loans reviewed collectively increased slightly from   $8.4 million   as of   December 31, 2015   to   $8.9 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Because of the nature of the Company s primary markets and business, a significant portion of the loan portfolio is secured by commercial real estate, including residential and commercial acquisition, development, and construction properties.  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   93%   of the loan portfolio had real estate as a primary component of collateral.  The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower.  Real estate values in many of our markets have improved.  The Company continues to thoroughly review and monitor its construction and commercial real estate concentrations and the associated allowance and sets limits by sector and region based on this internal review. 
    
  The following table summarizes the Company s allowance for loan losses by category and percent of loans within each category at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015     (amounts in thousands, except ratios)  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  Market and public confidence in our financial strength and in the strength of financial institutions in general will largely determine our access to appropriate levels of liquidity.  This confidence is significantly dependent on our ability to maintain sound asset quality and appropriate levels of capital resources.  The term "liquidity" refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our needs for funding loan originations, deposit withdrawals, maturities of borrowings and operating expenses.   Management measures our liquidity position by giving consideration to both on and off-balance sheet sources of, and demands for, funds on a daily and weekly basis. 
    
  Sources of liquidity include cash and cash equivalents (net of federal requirements to maintain reserves against deposit liabilities), investment securities eligible for pledging to secure borrowings, investments available-for-sale, loan repayments, loan sales, deposits and borrowings from the FHLB secured with pledged loans and securities, and from correspondent banks under overnight federal funds credit lines. During the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Company's primary use of its excess liquidity was to fund growth in the loan portfolio.  
    
  The Company sold $11.5 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated promissory notes to certain accredited investors in December 2015.  These notes are due on November 30, 2025 and the Company is obligated to pay interest at an annualized rate of 6.25% payable in quarterly installments commencing on March 1, 2016.  The Company may prepay the notes at any time after November 30, 2020, subject to compliance with applicable law.  The proceeds were used to refinance the Company's outstanding subordinated promissory notes issued in 2009.    
    
  Management believes that the Company s liquidity sources are adequate to meet its operating needs for at least the next 12 months.  Total shareholders  equity was   $64.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $60.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  .  Supplementing customer deposits as a source of funding, we have available lines of credit from various correspondent banks to purchase federal funds on a short-term basis of approximately   $37.0 million   that remain unused at   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank has the credit capacity to borrow up to   $177.9 million   from the FHLB with   $70.0 million   outstanding.  

-  40  - 

The Bank had total risk based capital of   15.7%  , Tier 1 risk based capital of   14.5%  , a leverage ratio of   10.8%  , and common equity Tier 1 capital of   14.5%   at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   15.6%  ,   14.4%  ,   10.2%  , and   14.4%  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  .  The Company had total risk based capital of   16.0%  , Tier 1 risk based capital of   12.5%  , a leverage ratio of   9.3%  , and common equity Tier 1 capital of   10.9%   at   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   16.0%  ,   12.4%  ,   8.8%  , and   11.3%  , respectively, at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The Company has not paid any cash dividends on its common stock since it suspended dividends in the fourth quarter of 2010.  As a bank holding company, the Company s ability to declare and pay dividends depends on certain federal regulatory considerations, including the guidelines of the Federal Reserve regarding capital adequacy and dividends.  A decision to pay any dividend in the future would be determined based on a number of factors including capital position and capital adequacy, ongoing operations and profitability, the risk profile of the institution and general market conditions, among other things.     

Regulatory Update  
    
  In July 2015, the Bank entered into a Written Agreement (the "2015 Written Agreement") with the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (the "FRB") replacing the Written Agreement the Company and the Bank entered into with the FRB and the North Carolina Office of the Commissioner of Banks in 2011. Under the terms of the 2015 Written Agreement, the Bank submitted and implemented the following plans: 
    
     a written plan to assure ongoing board oversight of the Bank's management and operations;  
     a written program for the review of new products, services, or business lines; and 
             
    an enhanced written program for conducting appropriate levels of customer due diligence by the Bank.  
       
  In addition, the Bank agreed that it will within 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter following the date of the 2015 Written Agreement, submit to FRB written progress reports detailing the form and manner of all actions taken to secure compliance with the 2015 Written Agreement and the results thereof. 
    
  The Bank continues to make progress in improving each of these areas and believes that it will be able to demonstrate full compliance with this agreement in the future.

ITEM 4   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
  As required by paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, an evaluation was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report.   As defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, the term disclosure controls and procedures means controls and other procedures of an issuer that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's (the "SEC") rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer's management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  Based on their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits to the SEC under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods required by the SEC's rules and forms. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report that the Company believes have materially affected or are likely to materially affect, its internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II. OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  In October 2013, multiple putative class action lawsuits were filed in United States district courts across the country against a number of different banks based on the banks' alleged role in "payday lending". Four of these lawsuits, filed in the Northern District of Georgia, the Middle District of North Carolina, the District of Maryland, and the Southern District of Florida, named the Bank as one of the defendants. The lawsuits allege that, by processing Automatic Clearing House transactions indirectly on behalf of "payday" lenders, the Bank is illegally participating in an enterprise to collect unlawful debts and is therefore liable to plaintiffs for damages under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. The lawsuits also allege a variety of state law claims. The Bank moved to dismiss each of these lawsuits. As previously reported, the Georgia action was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiffs and the District of Maryland granted the motion and dismissed the case, which the parties subsequently settled while on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Of the two remaining lawsuits, there are no updates to the lawsuit in the Southern District of Florida, which, as previously reported, has been stayed pending arbitration of the plaintiff's claims against the Bank's co-defendants. The Middle District of North Carolina granted the Bank s motion to dismiss in part and denied it in part; the case against the Bank has been stayed (except for limited discovery) pending an appeal by the Bank's co-defendants. 
    
  Additionally, we are party to certain other legal actions in the ordinary course of our business. We believe these actions are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business. While the outcome of these actions cannot be predicted with certainty, management s present judgment is that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or prospects. If, however, our assessment of these actions is inaccurate, or there are any significant adverse developments in these actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects could be adversely affected.  

ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS  
    
  There have been no material changes in the Company s risk factors from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

  I, David H. Rupp, certify that: 
    
           (1) 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Four Oaks Fincorp, Inc.; 
              (2)
