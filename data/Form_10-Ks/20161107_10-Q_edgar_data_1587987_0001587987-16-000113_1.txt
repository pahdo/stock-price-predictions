  ^ Denotes investment has been pledged as collateral under the Securitization Trusts. 
  * Denotes non-income producing security. 
  (1) Newtek values each unguaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) performing loans ( Loan ) using a discounted cash flow analysis which projects future cash flows and incorporates projections for Loan pre-payments and Loan defaults using historical portfolio data. The data predicts future prepayment and default probability on curves which are based on Loan age. The recovery assumption for each Loan is specific to the discounted valuation of the collateral supporting that Loan. Each Loan s cash flow is discounted at a rate which approximates a market yield. The Loans were originated under the SBA 7(a) program and conform to the underwriting guidelines in effect at their time of origination. Newtek has been awarded Preferred Lender Program ( PLP ) status from the SBA. The portions of these Loans are not guaranteed by the SBA. Individual loan participations can be sold to institutions which have been granted an SBA 750 license. Loans can also be sold as a pool of loans in a security form to qualified investors. 
  (2) Prime Rate is equal to 3.50% as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  (3) Newtek values non-performing SBA 7(a) loans using a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying collateral which supports the loan. Net recovery of collateral, (fair value less cost to liquidate) is applied to the discounted cash flow analysis based upon a time to liquidate estimate. Modified loans are valued based upon current payment streams and are re-amortized at the end of the modification period. 
  (4) Newtek values guaranteed performing SBA 7(a) loans using the secondary SBA 7(a) market as a reference point. Newtek routinely sells performing SBA 7(a) loans into this secondary market. Guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans partially funded as of the valuation date are valued using level two inputs as disclosed in Note 6. 
  (5) Controlled Investments are disclosed above as equity investments (except as otherwise noted) in those companies that are  Controlled Investments  of the Company as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940. A company is deemed to be a  Controlled Investment  of Newtek Business Services Corp. if Newtek Business Services Corp. or its subsidiaries owns more than 25% of the voting securities of such company. See Note 4 in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for transactions during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   with affiliates the Company is deemed to control. 
  (6) 50% owned by Wilshire Holdings I, Inc. (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.), 50% owned by non-affiliate. The term loan is past its original maturity date and currently in default. As such, the fair value of the investment is zero. 
  (7) 96.11% owned by Wilshire Partners, LLC (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.), 3.89% owned by Newtek Business Services Corp. 
  (8) 18.35% owned by Wilshire New York Partners IV, LLC (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.), 31.8% owned by Wilshire New York Partners V, LLC (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.) and 49.85% owned by Wilshire Holdings 1, Inc. (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.) 
  (9) 25% owned by Wilshire New York Partners V, LLC (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.), 65% owned by Wilshire Holdings I, Inc. (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.), and 10% owned by Exponential Business Development Co., Inc. (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.). 
  (10) 66.7% owned by The Whitestone Group, LLC (a subsidiary of Wilshire Holdings I, Inc., a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.), 33.3% owned by non-affiliate. 
  (11) 100% owned by Newtek Business Services Holdco1, Inc. (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.). 
  (12) 100% owned by Newtek LSP Holdco, LLC (a subsidiary of Wilshire Holdings I, Inc. and Banc-Serv Acquisition, Inc., both subsidiaries of Newtek Business Services Corp.).

  (14) 100% owned by Newtek LSP Holdco, LLC, (a subsidiary of Wilshire Holdings I, Inc. and Banc-Serv Acquisition, Inc., both subsidiaries of Newtek Business Services Corp.). 
  (15) 50% owned by Exponential Business Development Co., Inc. (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.), 30% owned by Wilshire New York Partners V, LLC (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.), 17.8% owned by Wilshire New York Partners IV, LLC (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.), and 2.2% owned by Wilshire New York Advisers II, LLC (a subsidiary of Newtek Business Services Corp.). 
  (16) Zero cost basis is reflected as the portfolio company was organized by the Company and incurred internal legal costs to organize the entity and immaterial external filing fees which were expensed when incurred. 
  (17) All of the Company's investments are in entities which are organized under the Laws of the United States and have a principal place of business in the United States. 
  (18) Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, the Company may not acquire any non-qualifying assets unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the Company s total assets. At   September 30, 2016  , 5.3% of total assets are non-qualifying assets.

These Taxable Subsidiaries allow the Company to hold equity securities of portfolio companies organized as pass-through entities while continuing to satisfy the requirements of a Regulated Investment Company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code ). 
  The following wholly-owned subsidiaries are consolidated in the financial statements of the Company:

The accompanying notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with Newtek s Annual Report for the year ended   December 31, 2015   on Form 10-K. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and pursuant to the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X and, therefore, omit or condense certain footnotes and other information normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, the condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments and reclassifications that are necessary for the fair presentation of financial results as of and for the periods presented. The results of operations for an interim period may not give a true indication of the results for the entire year.  The   December 31, 2015   consolidated statement of assets and liabilities has been derived from the audited financial statements as of that date. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
  Except as otherwise noted, all financial information included in the tables in the following footnotes is stated in thousands, except per share data. 
   
  NOTE 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: 
    
  Distributions 
    
  Dividends and distributions to the Company's common stockholders are recorded on the declaration date. The timing and amount to be paid out as a dividend or distribution is determined by the Company's Board of Directors (the  Board ) each quarter and is generally based upon the taxable earnings estimated by management. 
  Fair Value  
    
  The Company applies fair value accounting to certain of its financial instruments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 820   Fair Value Measurement ( ASC Topic 820 ). ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework used to measure fair value and requires disclosures for fair value measurements. In accordance with ASC Topic 820, the Company has categorized its financial instruments carried at fair value, based on the priority of the valuation technique, into a three-level fair value hierarchy. Fair value is a market-based measure considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the financial instrument rather than an entity-specific measure. Therefore, when market assumptions are not readily available, the Company s own assumptions are set to reflect those that management believes market participants would use in pricing the financial instrument at the measurement date.            
  The availability of observable inputs can vary depending on the financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of product, whether the product is new, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for financial instruments classified as Level 3.            
  Any changes to the valuation methodology are reviewed by management and the Board to confirm that the changes are appropriate. As markets change, new products develop and the pricing for products becomes more or less transparent, the Company will continue to refine its valuation methodologies. See further description of fair value methodology in Note 6. 
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. The level of uncertainty in estimates and assumptions increases with the length of time until the underlying transactions are complete. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
    
  Consolidation    
    
  As provided under Regulation S-X and ASC Topic 946, the Company will generally not consolidate its investment in a company other than an investment company subsidiary or a controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company.  

124 

     Table of Contents  

As of July 1, 2016, the Company determined that Exponential Business Development Co., Inc. ( Exponential ), previously a controlled portfolio company, met the criteria for consolidation under ASC Topic 946. This determination was based on Exponential's purchase of membership interests in two controlled portfolio companies during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .   
  Assets related to transactions that do not meet ASC Topic 860   Transfers and Servicing ( ASC Topic 860 ) requirements for accounting sale treatment are reflected in the Company s condensed consolidated statements of assets and liabilities as investments. Those assets are owned by the securitization trusts, and are included in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. The creditors of the special purpose entities have received security interests in such assets and such assets are not intended to be available to the creditors of the Company. 
    
  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Invested cash is held almost exclusively at financial institutions of high credit quality. The Company invests cash not held in interest free checking accounts or bank money market accounts mainly in U.S. Treasury only money market instruments or funds and other investment-grade securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , cash deposits in excess of insured amounts totaled approximately   $9,913,000  . 
  Restricted Cash 
    
  Restricted cash includes amounts due on Small Business Administration ( SBA ) loan-related remittances to third parties, cash reserves established as part of a voluntary agreement with the SBA, and cash reserves associated with securitization transactions. 
    
  Broker Receivable 
    
  Broker receivable represents amounts due from third parties for loans which have been traded at period end but have not yet settled. 
  Income Taxes 
    
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
    
  The Company s U.S. federal and state income tax returns prior to fiscal year 2013 are closed, and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings.           
  The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning with the 2015 tax year and operates in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. The RIC tax return includes Newtek Business Services Corp. and Newtek Small Business Finance, LLC ( NSBF ), a single member LLC disregarded for tax purposes. None of the Company s other subsidiaries are included in the RIC return. The Company will evaluate and record any deferred tax assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that are not part of the RIC. In order to maintain its RIC tax treatment, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to all income distributed to its stockholders as dividends.           
  Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company would then pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , no U.S. federal excise taxes were due.

The Company s Taxable Subsidiaries accrue income taxes payable based on the applicable corporate rates on the net unrealized appreciation generated by the controlled investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. Such deferred tax liabilities amounted to   $5,327,000   and   $857,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are recorded as a deferred tax liability on the condensed consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The change in deferred tax liabilities is included as a component of net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
    
  Share Repurchase Plan           
  The Company had a share repurchase program (the  Program ) which allowed the Company to repurchase up to 150,000 of the Company s outstanding common shares on the open market. The shares were purchased at prevailing market prices through open market transactions. The Program terminated on June 3, 2016. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased and retired   70,000   common shares in open market transactions for approximately $866,000 as detailed in the table below: 

On May 11, 2016, the Board approved a new share repurchase program (the  New Program ), which allows the Company to repurchase up to 150,000 shares of Company's outstanding common shares on the open market. The shares may be purchased from time to time at prevailing market prices through open market transactions, including block transactions. The Company expects the termination date of the New Program to be November 11, 2016, but it may be extended at the Board's discretion. The Company has not repurchased any common shares under the New Program during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In addition, the Company, may from time to time purchase shares of its debt securities on the Nasdaq Global Market. The Company did not make any repurchases of its debt securities during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Investment Income 
    
  Interest on debt investments is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding. Interest income is determined using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding. When a loan becomes 90 days or more past due, or if we otherwise do not expect to receive interest and principal repayments, the loan is placed on non-accrual status and the recognition of interest income is discontinued. Interest payments received on loans that are on non-accrual status are treated as reductions of principal until the principal is repaid.           
  Dividend income is recognized on an accrual basis for preferred equity securities to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected or realized. In determining the amount of dividend income to recognize, if any, from cash distributions on common equity securities, we will assess many factors including a portfolio company s cumulative undistributed income and operating cash flow. Cash distributions from common equity securities received in excess of such undistributed amounts are recorded first as a reduction of our investment and then as a realized gain on investment.           
  We receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA loan investments which we sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. Servicing income is earned for the full term of the loan or until the loan is repaid.           
  We receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including packaging, legal, late payment and prepayment fees. All other income is recorded when earned. Other income is generally non-recurring in nature and earned as  one time  fees in connection with the origination of new debt investments with non-affiliates.

Stock   Based Compensation 
    
  The Company accounts for its equity-based compensation plan using the fair value method, as prescribed by ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation. Accordingly, for restricted stock awards, the Company measures the grant date fair value based upon the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the grant and amortizes this fair value to compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period or vesting term. 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  This update requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the statement of assets and liabilities as a direct deduction from the debt liability. The Company adopted this standard with respect to its Notes payable - Securitization Trusts, Notes due 2022 and Notes due 2021. 
    
  New Accounting Standards 
    
   In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those periods. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases, including the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability for leases with a duration of greater than one year. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not completed its review of the new guidance; however, the Company anticipates that upon adoption of the standard it will recognize additional assets and corresponding liabilities related to leases on its condensed consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which, among other things, requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. Additionally, the ASU changes the disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those periods, and early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  Segments 
    
  The Company has determined that it has a single reporting segment and operating unit structure.  The Company issues debt and makes equity investments in portfolio companies in various industries. The Company separately evaluates the performance of each of its lending and investment relationships. However, because each of these debt and equity investment relationships have similar business and economic characteristics, they have been aggregated into a single lending and investment segment. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

  NOTE 6 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS: 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price ) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, management uses various valuation approaches, all of which have been approved by the Company's Board. In accordance with GAAP, a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available.           
  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 

Level 1 
       
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury, other U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets. 

Level 2 
       
    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. 

Level 3 
       
    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain private equity investments, retained residual interests in securitizations, residential mortgage servicing rights, and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts. 

131 

     Table of Contents  

In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an asset or a liability s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. The Company assesses the levels of assets and liabilities at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfers. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . The following section describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure different assets and liabilities at fair value and includes the level within the fair value hierarchy in which the assets and liabilities are categorized.           
  Level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.  
    
  When determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Company may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments, its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary methods for determining enterprise value include a discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company s net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) or revenue. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Company will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Company uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.  
    
  In addition, for certain debt investments, the Company may base its valuation on quotes provided by an independent third party broker.  
    
  Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.  
    
  The Company s investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded. 
    
  The following tables present fair value measurements of the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized by the Company to determine such fair values as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

NOTE 7 BORROWINGS: 
  Notes Due 2021 
    
  In April 2016, the Company and U.S. Bank, N.A. (the  Trustee ), entered into the Second Supplemental Indenture (the  Second Supplemental Indenture ) to the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, relating to the Company s issuance, offer and sale of $35,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Notes due 2021 (the  2021 Notes ). The Company granted an overallotment option of up to $5,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes. The sale of the Notes generated proceeds of approximately $33,750,000, net of underwriter's fees and expenses. In May 2016, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase $5,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes for an additional $5,066,000 in net proceeds.  
    
  The Notes will mature on March 31, 2021 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company s option at any time or from time to time on or after April 22, 2017, at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to but not including the date fixed for redemption. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per year payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year, commencing on June 30, 2016, and trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol  NEWTL.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with all terms of the 2021 Notes. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had borrowings comprised of the following:   

(1) Total combined commitments of the guaranteed and unguaranteed lines of credit are $50,000,000 at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Outstanding borrowings under the Notes due 2022, Notes due 2021 and Notes payable - Securitization Trusts consisted of the following:

     Table of Contents  

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying amount of the Company's borrowings under the Capital One lines of credit, Notes payable - related parties and Notes payable - Securitization Trusts, approximates fair value due to their variable interest rates.  
    
  The fair value of the fixed rate Notes due 2022 and Notes due 2021 is based on the closing public share price on the date of measurement. On   September 30, 2016  , the closing price of the Notes due 2022 was $25.88 per note, or $8,617,000. On   September 30, 2016  , the closing price of the Notes due 2021 was $25.59 per note, or $41,120,000. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 
  Total interest expense including unused line fees and amortization of deferred financing costs related to borrowings for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $2,328,000   and   $1,823,000  , respectively. Total interest expense for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   on all Company borrowings was   $5,764,000   and   $4,075,000  , respectively.  
   
  NOTE 8 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES: 
  Legal Matters 
    
  We may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period. 
  Guarantees 
  The Company is a guarantor on a bank line of credit held at CDS Business Services, Inc. ( NBC ), a controlled portfolio company. Maximum borrowings under the line of credit are   $10,000,000   with a maturity date of February 2017. At   September 30, 2016  , total principal owed by NBC was   $7,353,000  . In addition, the Company deposited   $750,000   to collateralize the guarantee.  On August 27, 2015, NBC entered into Amendment No. 2 (the  Amendment ) to the Loan and Security Agreement, dated February 28, 2011 (as amended through August 27, 2015, including the Amendment, the  Agreement ), by and between Sterling National Bank ( Sterling ) and NBC. The Amendment permits NBC to use a portion of the warehouse line of credit provided by Sterling under the Agreement to fund inventory financing arrangements NBC may provide to its clients. The Amendment also removed certain restrictions placed upon the Company in connection with its guaranty of the credit facility provided under the Agreement. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.  
    
  NBC also entered into an additional Loan and Security Agreement with Sterling on August 27, 2015 (the  504 Loan Agreement ), pursuant to which Sterling and any future participant lenders agreed to provide NBC another line of credit to fund SBA 504 loans extended by NBC (the  504 Facility ). Maximum borrowings under the 504 Facility are   $35,000,000  , depending upon syndication. At   September 30, 2016  , total principal owed by NBC was   $1,208,000  .  The 504 Loan Agreement specifies certain events of default, pursuant to which all outstanding amounts under the 504 Facility could become immediately due and payable. In addition, the Company has guaranteed NBC s obligations under the 504 Loan Agreement, pursuant to a Guaranty dated as of August 27, 2015. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee. 
    
  On June 23, 2015, UPSW and NTS (together, the  Borrowers ), each a controlled portfolio company of the Company, entered into a Credit and Guaranty Agreement (the  Agreement ), dated June 23, 2015, with Goldman Sachs Bank USA ( GS Bank ), as Administrative Agent, Collateral Agent and Lead Arranger, pursuant to which GS Bank agreed to extend the Borrowers a term loan facility up to an aggregate principal amount of   $38,000,000   (the  Facility  and each term loan made thereunder, a  Term Loan ). On September 18, 2015, the Agreement was amended to add Premier Payments LLC ( Premier ) as a borrower. The Company, Newtek Business Services Holdco 1, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company ( Intermediate Holdings ), and certain subsidiaries of Intermediate Holdings party to the Agreement from time to time, have agreed to guarantee the repayment of the Facility and are parties to the Agreement as  Guarantors  thereunder. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $22,000,000   was outstanding under this Facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company determined that it is not probable that payments would be required to be made under the guarantee.

  The matters discussed in this report, as well as in future oral and written statements by management of Newtek Business Services Corp., that are forward-looking statements are based on current management expectations that involve substantial risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from the results expressed in, or implied by, these forward- looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to future events or our future financial performance.

In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this report should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans or objectives will be achieved.

  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward-looking information that involves risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward-looking information due to the factors discussed under Item 1A- Risk Factors  of Part II of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, Item 1A- Risk Factors  of our annual report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016 and under  Forward-Looking Statements  of this Item 2. 
  Overview 
    
  We are a leading national non-bank lender and own and control certain portfolio companies under the Newtek        brand (our  controlled portfolio companies,  as defined below) that provide a wide range of business and financial products to small- and medium-sized businesses ( SMBs ). Newtek's products and services include: Business Lending including U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA ) 7(a) lending, Electronic Payment Processing, Managed Technology Solutions (Cloud Computing), eCommerce, Accounts Receivable Financing, The Secure Gateway, The Newtek Advantage       , personal and commercial Insurance Services, Web Services, Data Backup, Store and Retrieval and Payroll Solutions to SMB accounts across all industries. We have an established and reliable platform that is not limited by client size, industry type, or location. As a result, we believe we have a strong and diversified client base across every state in the U.S and across a variety of different industries. In addition, we have developed a financial and technology based business model that enables us and our controlled portfolio companies to acquire and process our SMB clients in a very cost effective manner. This capability is supported in large part by NewTracker       , our patented prospect management technology software, which is similar to but we believe better than the system popularized by Salesforce.com. We believe that this technology and business model distinguishes us from our competitors.

We are an internally-managed, closed-end, non-diversified investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the 1940 Act. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under the Code beginning in the 2015 tax year. As a BDC and a RIC, we are also subject to certain constraints, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. We converted to a BDC in November 2014. As a result, previously consolidated subsidiaries are now recorded as investments in controlled portfolio companies, at fair value. NSBF is a consolidated subsidiary and originates loans under the SBA's 7(a) program.

  Our common shares are currently listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol  NEWT . 
    
  NSBF has been granted Preferred Lender Program ( PLP ) status and originates, sells and services SBA 7(a) small business loans and is authorized to place SBA guarantees on loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Being a national lender, PLP status allows NSBF to expedite loans since NSBF is not required to present applications to the SBA for concurrent review and approval. The loss of PLP status could adversely impact our marketing efforts and ultimately loan origination volume which could negatively impact our results of operations. 
    
  As a BDC, our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation primarily through loans originated by our small business finance platform and our equity investments in certain portfolio companies that we control. 
  
   145 

     Table of Contents  

We target our debt investments, which are principally made through our small business finance platform under the SBA 7(a) program, to produce a coupon rate of prime plus 2.75% which enables us to generate rapid sales of loans in the secondary market. We typically structure our debt investments with the maximum seniority and collateral along with personal guarantees from portfolio company owners, in many cases collateralized by other assets including real estate. In most cases, our debt investment will be collateralized by a first lien on the assets of the portfolio company and a first or second lien on assets of guarantors, in both cases primarily real estate. All SBA loans are made with personal guarantees from any owner(s) of 20% or more of the portfolio company s equity. 
    
  We typically structure our debt investments to include non-financial covenants that seek to minimize our risk of capital loss such as lien protection and prohibitions against change of control. Our debt investments have strong protections, including default penalties, information rights and, in some cases, board observation rights and affirmative, negative and financial covenants. Debt investments in portfolio companies, including the controlled portfolio companies, have historically and are expected to continue to comprise the majority of our overall investments in number and dollar volume. 
    
  While the vast majority of our investments have been structured as debt, we have in the past and expect in the future to make selective equity investments primarily as either strategic investments to enhance the integrated operating platform or, to a lesser degree, under the Capco programs. For investments in our controlled portfolio companies, we focus more on tailoring them to the long term growth needs of the companies than to immediate return. Our objectives with these companies is to foster the development of the businesses as a part of the integrated operational platform of serving the SMB market, so we may reduce the burden on these companies to enable them to grow faster than they would otherwise and as another means of supporting their development. 
    
  We regularly engage in discussions with third parties with respect to various potential transactions. We may acquire an investment or a portfolio of investments or an entire company or sell a portion of our portfolio on an opportunistic basis. We, our subsidiaries, or our affiliates may also agree to manage certain other funds that invest in debt, equity or provide other financing or services to companies in a variety of industries for which we may earn management or other fees for our services. We may also invest in the equity of these funds, along with other third parties, from which we would seek to earn a return and/or future incentive allocations. Some of these transactions could be material to our business. Consummation of any such transaction will be subject to completion of due diligence, finalization of key business and financial terms (including price) and negotiation of final definitive documentation as well as a number of other factors and conditions including, without limitation, the approval of our board of directors and required regulatory or third party consents and, in certain cases, the approval of our stockholders. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any such transaction would be consummated. Any of these transactions or funds may require significant management resources either during the transaction phase or on an ongoing basis depending on the terms of the transaction. 
    
  Revenues 
    
  We generate revenue in the form of interest, dividend, servicing and other fee income on debt and equity investments. Our debt investments typically have a term of 10 to 25 years and bear interest at prime plus a margin. In some instances, we receive payments on our debt investments based on scheduled amortization of the outstanding balances. In addition, we receive repayments of some of our debt investments prior to their scheduled maturity date. The frequency or volume of these repayments fluctuates significantly from period to period. Our portfolio activity also reflects the proceeds of sales of securities. We receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA investments which we sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of packaging, prepayment, legal and late fees. We record such fees related to loans as other income. Dividends are recorded as dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are payable by the portfolio company and are expected to be collected. Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain.           
  We recognize realized gains or losses on investments based on the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment without regard to unrealized gains or losses previously recognized. We record current period changes in fair value of investments and assets that are measured at fair value as a component of the net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments or servicing assets, as appropriate, in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Expenses

     Table of Contents  

Our primary operating expenses are salaries and benefits, interest expense and other general and administrative costs, such as professional fees, marketing, loan related costs and rent. Since we are an internally-managed BDC with no outside adviser or management company, the BDC incurs all the related costs to operate the Company.

  Comparison of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
  Investment Income   

  Interest Income 
  The increase in interest income was attributable to the average outstanding performing portfolio of SBA non-affiliate investments increasing to $196,481,000 from $140,702,000 for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in the average outstanding performing portfolio resulted from the origination of new SBA non-

affiliate investments period over period. The increase was also attributed to the increase in the Prime Rate from 3.25% to 3.50% in December 2015. 
  Dividend Income 
  The decrease in dividend income is primarily related to a one-time dividend generated by Exponential Business Development Co., Inc. of $1,080,000 during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was offset by an increase in dividends generated from UPSW, Premier and a new controlled portfolio company investment, banc-serv. Dividend income is dependent on portfolio company earnings. Current quarter dividend income may not be indicative of future period dividend income. 
  NSBF Servicing Portfolio and Related Servicing Income 
  The following table represents NSBF originated servicing portfolio and servicing income earned for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

(1) Of this amount, the total average NSBF originated portfolio earning servicing income was $645,906,000 and $532,817,000 for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The increase in servicing income was attributable to the increase in total portfolio investments for which we earn servicing income. The portfolio earning servicing income increased $113,089,000 period over period. The increase was a direct result of increased investments in SBA non-affiliate investments from 2015 to 2016.  
  Other Income 
  Other income relates primarily to legal, packaging, and late fees earned from SBA loans. The increase is related to the increase in the number of loans originated to   96   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   75   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase resulted in an increase in legal and packaging fees earned. 
  Adjusted Net Investment Income 
    
  We utilize adjusted net investment income as a measure of our current and future financial performance. Adjusted net investment income is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not intended as an alternative measure of investment income as determined in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our calculation of adjusted net investment income is not necessarily comparable to similar measures as calculated by other companies that do not use the same definition or implementation guidelines. The table below reconciles net investment loss to adjusted net investment income.

     Table of Contents  

We believe this is a useful measure as it depicts the current income generated from our investment activities during the period. We include net realized gains on non-affiliate debt investments because they are recurring income related to the sale of SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments in the secondary market. The 2016 loss on lease is a one-time expense related to vacating our office space in West Hempstead, New York.   The lease loss adjustment was added back to adjusted net investment income when recognized in April 2016, the resulting monthly amortization of the lease loss will be deducted from adjusted net investment income through the remaining term of the lease.  The 2015 loss on lease adjustment was related to the amortization of the lease loss on our former New York City principal office, which was exited in October 2011. We exclude the loss on lease  because it is a non-recurring, non-cash expense when the initial loss is recorded, and the remaining rental expense is recognized each period. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is a non-cash expense. 
  Expenses:   

  Salaries and Benefits 
  Salaries and benefits were essentially unchanged period over period. Salaries and benefits increased $147,000 primarily due to an increase in headcount at NSBF. The additional headcount relates primarily to employees performing loan processing, loan closing or loan servicing functions as a result of the increase in loan originations. The increase was offset by a $152,000 increase in managerial assistance fees charged to controlled affiliates which are credited to salaries and benefits.  
  Stock-Based Compensation 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted 100,050 restricted stock awards to certain employees which resulted in the recognition of $226,000 of stock-based compensation. There was no stock-based compensation expense recognized during the three months ended    September 30, 2015  .  
  Interest Expense 
  The following is a summary of interest expense by facility for the three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :  

In September 2015 and April 2016, the Company issued $8,324,000 of 7.5% Notes due 2022, and $40,250,000 of 7.0% Notes due 2021 (collectively, the  Notes), respectively. The Company incurred $987,000 in related interest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016 on the Notes.  Interest expense on notes payable - related parties was   $19,000   and   $461,000

     Table of Contents  

during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and represents interest on amounts borrowed under an unsecured revolving line of credit extended by UPSW and NTS. The decrease is attributed to a decrease in the average outstanding balance on Notes payable - related parties during the period.  
    
  Loss on Lease 
    
  In April 2016, the Company moved its headquarters to Lake Success, New York. As a result, the Company vacated its spaces in West Hempstead, New York and New York, New York. The Company recorded a loss related to the remaining liabilities under the West Hempstead lease, offset by any future rental income. Amounts recorded during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   represent amortization of the loss. The Company has sublet its space in New York, New York and continues to market its space for sublease in West Hempstead, New York. 
  Other General and Administrative Costs 
  Other general and administrative costs include professional fees, marketing, loan related costs and rent. The increase in other general and administrative costs is primarily related to an increase in loan related costs. Loan related costs include referral fees, servicing expenses, appraisal fees, legal fees, search fees and other collateral preservation costs. Loan related costs increase as the number of loans we originate and service increase. At   September 30, 2016  , our loan portfolio consists of 1,158 SBA 7(a) loans as compared to 897 at   September 30, 2015  . Other increases include rent expenses as a result of the move to our Lake Success offices, increases in insurance and increases in tax and accounting fees.  
  Net Realized Gains and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation 
    
  Net realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized gains for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   $9,489,000   and   $6,848,000  , respectively. Realized losses were $777,000 and $228,000 during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses become realized. 
    
  Net Realized Gains on SBA Non-Affiliate Investments 

(1) Realized gains greater than 110.00% must be split 50/50 with the SBA in accordance with SBA regulations. The realized gains recognized above reflects amounts net of split with the SBA. 
    
  Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments 

153 

     Table of Contents  

Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments relates to guaranteed portions of SBA debt investments made which the Company sells into a secondary market. Unrealized appreciation of SBA guaranteed investments represents the fair value adjustment of guaranteed portions of loans which have not yet been sold. Unrealized depreciation represents the reversal of unrealized appreciation when the loans are sold. 
    
  Net unrealized appreciation on SBA unguaranteed non-affiliate investments resulted from a decrease in discount rates on performing and non-performing SBA unguaranteed non-affiliate investments. The discount rate decreased from 5.38% to 5.05% period over period on performing SBA unguaranteed non-affiliate investments. The discount rate decreased from 8.50% to 6.24% period over period on non-performing SBA unguaranteed non-affiliate investments.  
    
  Net unrealized appreciation on controlled investments for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of unrealized appreciation of $750,000 and $5,852,000 on our investments in Premier and UPSW, respectively, offset by unrealized depreciation of $1,305,000 and $700,000 on our investments in NTS and NBC. The primary driver of the increases were increases in multiples of comparable companies and increases in revenue growth projections for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decreases at NTS and NBC were based on weaker than projected financial performance. Net unrealized appreciation on controlled investments was $770,000 for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This consisted primarily of $600,000, $215,000 and $200,000 of unrealized appreciation on the Company's investments in UPSW, SBL and Newtek Insurance Agency, LLC ( NIA ), respectively. Unrealized appreciation was offset by unrealized depreciation of $50,000 and $208,000 on the Company's investments in NTS and NBC. The primary driver of the increase in UPSW and NIA was better than projected financial performance. The primary driver of the increase in SBL was better than projected financial performance and the addition of a new third-party servicing contract which provides a longer-term stable revenue stream. The primary driver of the decrease in NTS and NBC was weaker than projected financial performance. 
    
  Provision for Deferred Taxes on Unrealized Appreciation of Investments 
    
  Certain consolidated subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal and state income taxes. These taxable subsidiaries are not consolidated with the Company for income tax purposes, but are consolidated for GAAP purposes, and may generate income tax liabilities or assets from temporary differences in the recognition of items for financial reporting and income tax purposes at the subsidiaries. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a provision for deferred taxes on unrealized gains of $2,028,000.

  Interest Income 
  The increase in interest income was attributable to the average outstanding performing portfolio of SBA non-affiliate investments increasing to $182,637,000 from $132,758,000 for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase in the average outstanding performing portfolio resulted from the origination of new SBA non-affiliate investments period over period. The increase also was attributed to the increase in the Prime Rate from 3.25% to 3.50% in December 2015. 
  Dividend Income 
  The increase in dividend income is primarily related to an increase of dividends generated from Premier of $1,050,000, an increase of $900,000 in dividends generated from UPSW, an increase of $390,000 in dividends generated from NTS and $240,000 of dividends generated from banc-serv, a new wholly owned controlled portfolio company investment. The increase in 2015 was the result of a one-time dividend generated by Exponential Business Development Co., Inc. of $1,080,000 in the prior period. Dividend income is dependent on portfolio company earnings. Current period dividend income may not be indicative of future period dividend income.

  The increase in servicing income was attributable to the increase in total portfolio investments for which we earn servicing income. The portfolio earning servicing income increased $106,071,000 period over period. The increase was a direct result of increased investments in SBA non-affiliate investments from 2015 to 2016.  
  Other Income 
  Other income relates primarily to legal, packaging, prepayment, and late fees earned from SBA loans. The increase is related to the increase in the number of loans originated to   295   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   from   208   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase resulted in an increase in legal and packaging fees earned.

The Company incurred $1,920,000 in related interest expense during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   on the Notes.  Interest expense on notes payable - related parties was   $196,000   and   $491,000   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and represents interest on amounts borrowed under an unsecured revolving line of credit extended by UPSW and NTS. The decrease is attributed to a decrease in the average outstanding balance on Notes payable - related parties during the period.  In June 2014, the Company entered into a four year $20,000,000 credit agreement with Capital One consisting of a $10,000,000 term loan and a revolving line of credit of up to $10,000,000. The NBS Capital One term loan and line of credit were paid in full and extinguished in June 2015, and as such, no interest expense was incurred during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in interest expense related to the NSBF Capital One lines of credit was a result of a decrease in the average outstanding balance during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   when compared to   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Loss on Lease 
    
  In April 2016, the Company moved its headquarters to Lake Success, New York. As a result, the Company vacated its spaces in West Hempstead, New York and New York, New York. The Company recorded a loss of   $1,335,000   (net of $303,000 of amortization), related to the remaining liabilities under the West Hempstead lease, offset by any future rental income, during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . The Company has sublet its space in New York, New York and continues to market its space for sublease in West Hempstead, New York. 
  Other General and Administrative Costs 
  Other general and administrative costs include professional fees, marketing, loan related costs and rent. The increase in other general and administrative costs is primarily related to an increase in loan related costs. Loan related costs include referral fees, servicing expenses, appraisal fees, legal fees, search fees and other collateral preservation costs. Loan related costs increase as the number of loans we originate and service increase. At   September 30, 2016  , our loan portfolio consists of 1,158 SBA 7(a) loans as compared to 897 at   September 30, 2015  . Other increases include rent expenses as a result of the move to our Lake Success offices, increases in insurance and increases in tax and accounting fees.   
  Net Realized Gains and Net Unrealized Appreciation and Depreciation 
    
  Net realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the cost basis of our investments without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized and includes investments charged off during the period, net of recoveries. Realized gains for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were $23,299,000 and   $22,287,000  , respectively. Realized losses were $763,000 and $628,000 during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment fair values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.

  Net Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments 

Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on SBA guaranteed non-affiliate investments relates to guaranteed portions of SBA debt investments made which the Company sells into a secondary market. Unrealized appreciation of SBA guaranteed investments represents the fair value adjustment of guaranteed portions of loans which have not yet been sold. Unrealized depreciation represents the reversal of unrealized appreciation when the SBA 7(a) loans are sold. 
    
  The decrease in net unrealized depreciation on SBA unguaranteed non-affiliate investments resulted from a decrease in discount rates on performing and non-performing SBA unguaranteed non-affiliate investments. The discount rate decreased from 5.38% to 5.05% period over period on performing SBA unguaranteed non-affiliate investments. The discount rate decreased from 8.50% to 6.24% period over period on non-performing SBA unguaranteed non-affiliate investments. 
    
  Net unrealized appreciation on controlled investments for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   consisted of unrealized appreciation of $3,997,000 and $9,552,000 on our investments in Premier and UPSW, respectively offset by unrealized depreciation of $1,000,000, $1,305,000, and $925,000 on our investments in SBL, NTS, and NBC, respectively. The primary driver of the increases were increases in multiples of comparable companies and increases in revenue growth projections. The decrease in SBL, NTS, and NBC was based on weaker than projected financial performance.  Net unrealized appreciation on controlled investments for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   consisted primarily of $5,339,000 of unrealized appreciation on the Company's investment in UPSW and $5,565,000 of unrealized appreciation on the Company's investment in SBL offset by unrealized depreciation of approximately $420,000 on the Company's investment in NTS and $408,000 on NBC. The primary driver for the increase in SBL was the addition of a new third-party servicing contract which provides a longer-term stable revenue stream. The primary driver of the increase in UPSW was better than projected financial performance.

the subsidiaries. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized a provision for deferred taxes on unrealized gains of $4,469,000. 
    
  Net Unrealized Depreciation on Servicing Assets 

The increase in unrealized depreciation on servicing assets is primarily related to the increase in the discount rate from 11.57% to 12.03% offset by decreases in the assumed cumulative prepayment and average cumulative default rates. The increase in discount rate is attributed to determining the discount rate based on risk spreads and observable secondary market transactions for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a weighted average cost of capital and servicing spread for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The assumed cumulative prepayment rate decreased from 19% to 15.5% and the assumed average cumulative default rate decreased from 25% to 20%.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Overview 
  Cash requirements and liquidity needs over the next twelve months are anticipated to be funded primarily through operating results, available cash and cash equivalents, existing credit lines, proposed new credit lines, additional securitizations of the Company s SBA unguaranteed loan portions and additional issuances of debt or equity securities.   
    
  Public Offerings 
    
  In April 2016, the Company and U.S. Bank, N.A. (the  Trustee ), entered into the Second Supplemental Indenture (the  Second Supplemental Indenture ) to the Base Indenture between the Company and the Trustee, relating to the Company s issuance, offer and sale of $35,000,000 aggregate principal amount of 7.0% Notes due 2021 (the  2021 Notes ). The Company granted an overallotment option of up to $5,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2021 Notes. The sale of the Notes generated proceeds of approximately $33,750,000, net of underwriter's fees and expenses. In May 2016, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase $5,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of notes for an additional $5,066,000 in net proceeds. The 2021 Notes are the Company s direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company s other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company s future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2021 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company s subsidiaries.   
    
  The 2021 Notes will mature on March 31, 2021 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company s option at any time or from time to time on or after April 22, 2017, at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current quarterly interest period accrued to but not including the date fixed for redemption. The 2021 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per year payable quarterly on March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31 of each year, commencing on June 30, 2016, and trade on the Nasdaq Global Market under the trading symbol  NEWTL.   
    
  The Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture, contains certain covenants including covenants requiring the Company to comply with (regardless of whether it is subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, to comply with (regardless of whether it is subject to) the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act as in effect immediately prior to the issuance of the 2021 Notes, and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2021 Notes and the Trustee if the Company should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture. The Base Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2021 Notes may declare such 2021 Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company is in compliance with all covenants related to the 2021 Notes.  
    
  On October 15, 2015 we completed a public offering of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $16.50 per share. We also sold an additional 300,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $16.50 per share pursuant to the underwriter's full exercise of the over-allotment option. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $35,290,000. 
    
  In September 2015, the Company and the Trustee entered into the Base Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture relating to the Company's issuance, offer, and sale of $8,324,000, including the underwriter's partial exercise of their over-allotment option, in aggregate principal amount of the 7.5% Notes due 2022 (the  2022 Notes ). The 2022 Notes are the Company s direct unsecured obligations and rank: (i) pari passu with the Company s other outstanding and future unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior to any of the Company s future indebtedness that expressly provides it is subordinated to the 2022 Notes; (iii) effectively subordinated to all the Company s existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which the Company subsequently grants security), to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and (iv) structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of any of the Company s subsidiaries. The 2022 Notes will mature on September 30, 2022 and may be redeemed in whole or in part at the Company s option at any time or from time to time on or after September 23, 2018, at a redemption price of 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments otherwise payable for the then-current

  The Base Indenture, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, contains certain covenants including covenants requiring the Company to comply with (regardless of whether it is subject to) the asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(A) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, to comply with the restrictions on dividends, distributions and purchase of capital stock set forth in Section 18(a)(1)(B) of the 1940 Act as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, and to provide financial information to the holders of the 2022 Notes and the Trustee if the Company should no longer be subject to the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. These covenants are subject to important limitations and exceptions that are described in the Base Indenture, as supplemented by the Second Supplemental Indenture. The Base Indenture provides for customary events of default and further provides that the Trustee or the holders of 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding 2022 Notes may declare such 2022 Notes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of any event of default after expiration of any applicable grace period. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company is in compliance with all covenants related to the 2022 Notes. 
    
  On November 18, 2014 we completed a public offering of 2,200,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $12.50 per share. We also sold an additional 330,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $12.50 per share pursuant to the underwriter's full exercise of the over-allotment option. Proceeds, net of offering costs and expenses were $27,883,000. 
    
  Capital One Facilities           
  NSBF has a $50,000,000 credit facility with Capital One. The facility provides for a 55% advance rate on the non-guaranteed portions of the SBA 7(a) loans it originates, and a 90% advance rate on the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans it originates. The interest rate on the portion of the facility collateralized by the government guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, is set at Prime plus 1.00%, and there is a quarterly facility fee equal to 0.25% on the unused portion of the revolving credit calculated as of the end of each calendar quarter. The interest rate on the portion of the facility collateralized by the non-guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, is set at Prime plus 1.875%, and there is a quarterly facility fee equal to 0.25% on the unused portion of the revolving credit calculated as of the end of each calendar quarter. In June 2015, we amended the existing facility to eliminate the fixed charge coverage ratio in exchange for a debt service ratio, new EBITDA minimums, the elimination of restrictions on our ability to pay dividends to stockholders, as well as the release of the guarantees of our former subsidiaries (now treated as portfolio companies). In addition, the amendment extended the date on which the facility will convert to a term loan from May 16, 2016 to May 16, 2017 and extended the maturity date of the facility to May 16, 2019. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $23,519,000   and   $26,400,000   outstanding under the unguaranteed and guaranteed lines of credit, respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in full compliance with all applicable loan covenants.           
  Related Party Notes Payable           
  In June 2015, we entered into an unsecured revolving line of credit agreement with UPSW and NTS. Maximum borrowings under the line of credit are $38,000,000. The outstanding balance bears interest at a rate equal to (a) the greater of LIBOR or 50 basis points plus (b) 7% or at a rate equal to (y) the greater of the Prime Rate or 3.5%, plus (z) 6%. At   September 30, 2016  , the line of credit bears interest at a rate of 7.5%. The revolving line of credit has a maturity date of June 21, 2019. The outstanding borrowings at   September 30, 2016   were   $7,400,000  . 
    
  Securitization Transactions           
  In December 2010, we created a financing channel for the sale of the unguaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans held on our balance sheet. We transferred the unguaranteed portions of SBA loans of $19,615,000, and an additional $3,000,000 in loans issued subsequent to the transaction, to a special purpose entity created for this purpose, Newtek Small Business Loan Trust 2010-1 (the  2010 Trust ), which in turn issued notes (the  securitization notes ) for the par amount of $16,000,000 against the assets in a private placement. The Trust is only permitted to purchase the unguaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans, issue asset-backed securities, and make payments on the securities. The 2010 Trust issued a single series of securitization notes to pay for the unguaranteed portions it acquired from us and will be dissolved when those securities have been paid in full. The primary source for repayment of the securitization notes is the cash flows generated from the unguaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans now owned by the 2010 Trust. Principal on the securitization notes will be paid by cash flow in excess of that needed to pay various fees related to the operation of the 2010 Trust and interest on the debt. At the time of issuance, the securitization notes had an anticipated maturity of about five years based on the expected performance of the underlying collateral and structure of the debt and a legal maturity of 30 years from the date of issuance. The assets of the 2010 Trust are legally isolated and are not available to pay our creditors. We continue to retain rights to cash reserves and all residual interests in the 2010 Trust and will

receive servicing income. Proceeds from this transaction were used to repay a Capital One loan and for general corporate and lending purposes. Because we determined we are the primary beneficiary of the Trust we needed to consolidate the Trust into our financial statements. We continue to recognize the securitization notes in Notes payable. The investors and the 2010 Trust have no recourse to any of our other assets for failure if the Trust has insufficient funds to pay its obligations when due; however, Newtek had provided a limited guaranty to the investors in the 2010 Trust in an amount not to exceed 10% of the original issuance amount, to be used after all of the assets of the 2010 Trust have been exhausted. This limited guaranty was removed in the subsequent 2015 upsizing of the 2010 Trust, as set forth below. The notes were issued with an  AA  rating from S P based on the underlying collateral. 
    
  In December 2011, we entered into a Supplemental Indenture by which the $16,000,000 of securitization notes issued by the 2010 Trust were amended to reflect a new principal amount of $12,880,000, as a result of principal payments made, and additional notes were issued in an initial principal amount of $14,899,000, so that the initial aggregate principal amount of all notes as of December 31, 2011 totaled $27,779,000. The notes are backed by approximately $40,500,000 of the unguaranteed portions of loans originated, and include an additional $5,000,000 to be originated and issued to the 2010 Trust by us under the SBA loan program. The notes retained their  AA  rating under S P, and the final maturity date of the amended notes is March 22, 2037. The proceeds of the transaction have been used to repay debt and originate new loans. 
    
  In March 2013, we transferred the $23,569,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans of, and an additional $5,900,000 in loans issued subsequent to the transaction, to a special purpose entity, Newtek Small Business Loan Trust 2013-1 (the  2013 Trust ). The 2013 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $20,909,000 against the assets in a private placement. The notes received an  A  rating by S  and the final maturity date of the amended notes is June 25, 2038. The proceeds of the transaction have been used to repay debt and originate new loans. 
    
  In December 2013, we completed an additional transaction whereby the unguaranteed portions of SBA loans of $23,947,000, and an additional $3,642,000 in loans issued subsequent to the transaction, was transferred to the 2013 Trust. The 2013 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $24,433,000 against the assets in a private placement. The notes received an  A  rating by S P, and the final maturity date of the amended notes is April 25, 2039. The proceeds of the transaction have been used to repay debt and originate new loans. 
    
  In December 2014, we completed an additional transaction which resulted in the transfer of $36,000,000 of unguaranteed portions of SBA loans and an additional $7,500,000 in loans which were issued subsequent to the transaction, to the Newtek Small Business Loan Trust 2014-1 (the  2014 Trust ).  The 2014 Trust in turn issued securitization notes for the par amount of $31,700,000 against the assets in a private placement. The notes received an  A  rating by S P, and the final maturity date of the notes is April 2040. The proceeds of the transaction have been used to repay debt and originate new loans. 
    
  In September 2015, we issued additional unguaranteed SBA 7(a) loan-backed notes as part of an upsizing of the 2010 Trust. Note principal amounts of the original and exchanged notes were approximately $8,771,000 with additional notes which totaled approximately $32,028,000 as part of the upsizing. The initial aggregate amount of the senior notes issued by the 2010 Trust were approximately $40,800,000 on the closing date. The notes are collateralized by approximately $46,458,000 of SBA 7(a) unguaranteed portions and include a prefunded amount of $14,679,000 to be originated and transferred subsequently to the Trust. The notes retained their  AA  rating under S P, and the final maturity of the amended notes is February 25, 2041. 
    
  Cash Flows and Liquidity 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s unused sources of liquidity consisted of $81,000 available through the Capital One facility; $11,719,000 available through notes payable with related parties;   $2,718,000   in unrestricted cash and   $35,000   in money market funds. 
    
  Restricted cash of $  24,781,000   as of   September 30, 2016   is primarily held in NSBF. The majority, or $23,031,000 of restricted cash, is related to NSBF, and includes reserves in the event payments are insufficient to cover interest and/or principal with respect to securitizations, payments collected which are due to loan participants, a reserve established as part of a voluntary agreement with the SBA and amounts owed to the SBA.

The Company generated and used cash as follows:   

  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , operating activities used cash of $23,048,000, consisting primarily of (i) $217,779,000 of SBA 7(a) loan investments, (ii) a $5,400,000 investment in 100% of the membership interests of banc-serv Partners, LLC (iii) a $2,057,000 repurchase of a loan from the SBA, (iv) a debt investment of $750,000 in PMT, and (v) a debt investment of $1,020,000 in Excel WebSolutions, LLC. These decreases were offset by (i) the decrease in broker receivables which arise from the guaranteed portions of SBA 7(a) loans that were traded but had not settled before period end and represent the amount of cash due from the purchasing broker; the amount varies depending on loan origination volume and timing of sales at period end, (ii) $18,045,000 of principal payments from affiliate and non-affiliate investments, (iii) a decrease in restricted cash of $1,923,000, and (iv) $183,452,000 of proceeds from the sale of SBA 7(a) investments.  
  Net cash provided by financing activities was $21,752,000 consisting primarily of  (i) proceeds of $38,510,000, net of deferred financing costs from our offer and sale of 7.0% Notes due 2021, (ii) net proceeds of $20,819,000 from borrowings under the Capital One lines of credit, and (iii) Net borrowings of $1,753,000 under related party revolving line of credit. These increases were offset by (i) $22,168,000 of dividend payments, (ii) $16,297,000 of principal payments related to securitizations, and (iii) $866,000 of share repurchases.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. We have identified the following items as critical accounting policies. 
  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  We value investments for which market quotations are readily available at their market quotations. However, a readily available market value is not expected to exist for many of the investments in our portfolio, and we value these portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board under our valuation policy and process. We may seek pricing information with respect to certain of our investments from pricing services or brokers or dealers in order to value such investments. We also employ independent third party valuation firms for certain of our investments for which there is not a readily available market value.            
  The application of our valuation methods may include comparisons of our portfolio companies to peer companies that are public, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings, discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors. When an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we will consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate the private equity valuation. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments and may differ materially from values that may ultimately be received or settled.           
  Our Board is ultimately and solely responsible for determining, in good faith, the fair value of investments that are not publicly traded, whose market prices are not readily available on a quarterly basis or any other situation where portfolio investments require a fair value determination.           
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price). ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels for disclosure purposes. The Company carries all investments at fair value. Additionally, the Company carries its credits in lieu of cash, notes payable in credits in lieu of cash, and servicing assets at fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority (Level 1) to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and gives the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). An asset or liability s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of the significant input to its valuation. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows: 
  
   164 

     Table of Contents  

Level 1         
       
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury, other U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in over-the-counter markets. 

Level 2 
       
    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts whose value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes certain U.S. Government and agency mortgage-backed debt securities, corporate debt securities, derivative contracts and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. 

Level 3 
       
    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. This category generally includes certain private equity investments, retained residual interests in securitizations, residential mortgage servicing rights, and highly structured or long-term derivative contracts. 
   
 Valuation of Investments   
    
  Level 1 investments are valued using quoted market prices. Level 2 investments are valued using market consensus prices that are corroborated by observable market data and quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. Level 3 investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by the Board, based on input of management, the audit committee and independent valuation firms that have been engaged at the direction of the Board to assist in the valuation of certain portfolio investments without a readily available market quotation at least once during a trailing twelve-month period under a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.           
  When determining fair value of Level 3 debt and equity investments, the Company may take into account the following factors, where relevant: the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company s ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flows, the markets in which the portfolio company does business, comparisons to publicly traded securities, and changes in the interest rate environment and the credit markets generally that may affect the price at which similar investments may be made and other relevant factors. The primary methods for determining enterprise value include a discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple analysis whereby appropriate multiples are applied to the portfolio company s net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) or revenue. The enterprise value analysis is performed to determine the value of equity investments and to determine if debt investments are credit impaired. If debt investments are credit impaired, the Company will use the enterprise value analysis or a liquidation basis analysis to determine fair value. For debt investments that are not determined to be credit impaired, the Company uses a market interest rate yield analysis to determine fair value.           
  In addition, for certain debt investments, the Company may base its valuation on quotes provided by an independent third party broker.            
  Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company may realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded.            
  The Company s investments are subject to market risk. Market risk is the potential for changes in the value due to market changes. Market risk is directly impacted by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the investments are traded. 
    
  Income Recognition 

165 

     Table of Contents  

Interest on loan investments is accrued and included in income based on contractual rates applied to principal amounts outstanding. Interest income is determined using a method that results in a level rate of return on principal amounts outstanding. When a loan becomes 90 days or more past due, or if we otherwise do not expect to receive interest and principal repayments, the loan is placed on non-accrual status and the recognition of interest income is discontinued. Interest payments received on loans that are on non-accrual status are treated as reductions of principal until the principal is repaid. 
    
  We receive servicing income related to the guaranteed portions of SBA loan investments which we sell into the secondary market. These recurring fees are earned daily and recorded when earned. Servicing income is earned for the full term of the loan or until the loan is repaid.           
  We receive a variety of fees from borrowers in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including packaging fees, late fees and prepayment fees. All other income is recorded when earned.           
  Dividend income is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Distributions of earnings from a portfolio companies are evaluated to determine if the distribution is income, return of capital or realized gain. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed based upon the differences between the financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be realized or settled. If available evidence suggests that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance is required to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. 
    
  The Company s U.S. federal and state income tax returns prior to fiscal year 2013 are closed, and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings.           
  The Company has elected to be treated as a RIC beginning with the 2015 tax year under the Code and operates in a manner so as to continue to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. The RIC tax return includes Newtek Business Services Corp. and NSBF, a single member LLC disregarded for tax purposes. None of the Company s other subsidiaries are included in the RIC return. The Company will evaluate and record any deferred tax assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries that are not part of the RIC. In order to maintain its RIC tax treatment, among other things, the Company is required to meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements and timely distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of investment company taxable income, as defined by the Code, for each tax year. The Company intends to make the requisite distributions to its stockholders, which will generally relieve the Company from U.S. federal income taxes with respect to all income distributed to its stockholders as dividends.           
  Depending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. The Company would then pay a 4% excise tax on such income, as required. To the extent that the Company determines that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar year basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, the Company accrues excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , no U.S. federal excise taxes were due.           
  The Company s Taxable Subsidiaries accrue income taxes payable based on the applicable corporate rates on the net unrealized appreciation generated by the controlled investments held by the Taxable Subsidiaries. Such deferred tax liabilities amounted to   $5,327,000   and   $857,000   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are recorded as a deferred tax liability on the condensed consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. The change in deferred tax liabilities is included as a component of net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.  
  New Accounting Standards 
    
  In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  which is intended to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those periods. Early application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  
   166 

     Table of Contents  

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases , which amends various aspects of existing accounting guidance for leases, including the recognition of a right of use asset and a lease liability for leases with a duration of greater than one year. The ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those periods. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has not completed its review of the new guidance; however, the Company anticipates that upon adoption of the standard it will recognize additional assets and corresponding liabilities related to leases on its condensed consolidated statements of assets and liabilities. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities , which, among other things, requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. Additionally, the ASU changes the disclosure requirements for financial instruments. This ASU is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those periods, and early adoption is permitted for certain provisions. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on its condensed consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
  We consider the principal types of risk in our investing activities to be fluctuations in interest rates and loan portfolio valuations and the availability of the secondary market for our SBA loans. Risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risks, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs. 
  NSBF primarily lends at an interest rate of prime, which resets on a quarterly basis, plus a fixed margin. The Capital One revolver lines as well as the securitization notes are on a prime plus a fixed factor basis. As a result, the Company believes it  
  
   167 

     Table of Contents  

has matched its cost of funds to its interest income in its financing activities. However, because of the differential between the amount lent and the smaller amount financed a significant change in market interest rates will have a material effect on our income. In periods of sharply rising interest rates, our cost of funds will increase at a slower rate than the interest income earned on the loans we have made; this should improve our net investment income, holding all other factors constant. However, a reduction in interest rates will result in the Company experiencing a reduction in investment income; that is, its interest income will decline more quickly than interest expense resulting in a net reduction of benefit to investment income. 
  NSBF depends on the availability of secondary market purchasers for the guaranteed portions of SBA loans and the premium received on such sales to support its lending operations. At this time the secondary market for the guaranteed portions of SBA loans is robust but during the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis the Company had difficulty selling its loans for a premium; although not expected at this time, if such conditions did recur NSBF would most likely cease making new loans and could experience a substantial reduction in profitability. 
  We do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash (includes cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and money market funds) which was approximately $27,535,000 at   September 30, 2016  . We do not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. All of our transactions are conducted in U.S. dollars and we do not have any foreign currency or foreign exchange risk. We do not trade commodities or have any commodity price risk. 
  We believe that we have placed our demand deposits, cash investments and their equivalents with high credit-quality financial institutions. Invested cash is held almost exclusively at financial institutions of high credit quality. The Company invests cash not held in interest free checking accounts or bank money market accounts mainly in U.S. Treasury only money market instruments or funds and other investment-grade securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , cash deposits in excess of insured amounts totaled approximately $  9,913,000  .

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
    
  As of the period covered by this report, we, including our chief executive officer and chief accounting officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act). Based on our evaluation, our management, including the chief executive officer and chief accounting officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in timely alerting management, including the chief executive officer and chief accounting officer, of material information about us required to be included in our periodic SEC filings. However, in evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, are based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. There has not been any change in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 
    
  We may, from time to time, be involved in litigation arising out of our operations in the normal course of business or otherwise. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of any current legal proceedings cannot at this time be predicted with certainty, we do not expect any current matters will materially affect our financial condition or results of operations; however , there can be no assurance whether any pending legal proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations in any future reporting period.  The Company s controlled portfolio companies are currently involved in various litigation matters, including as follows: 
    
  During the quarter ended June 30, 2013, the Federal Trade Commission (the  FTC ) amended an existing complaint in the matter Federal Trade Commission v. WV Universal Management, LLC et al., in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida (the  Court ), to add UPSW as an additional defendant on one count of providing substantial assistance in violation of the Telemarketing Sales Rule. On November 18, 2014, the Court issued an Order granting the FTC s motion for summary judgment against UPSW on the single count. Subsequently, the FTC filed motions for a permanent injunction and equitable monetary relief against UPSW and the other remaining defendants. Prior to the Court hearing on the motions, UPSW and the FTC reached a settlement on the FTC s motion for a permanent injunction. On May 19, 2015, the Court entered an equitable monetary judgment against UPSW for approximately $1,735,000, which has been deposited with the Court pending the outcome of UPSW s appeal of the judgment. The $1,735,000 was fully expensed in 2014 by UPSW. On June 14, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit set aside the Court s judgment awarding joint and several liability for equitable monetary relief in the amount of approximately $1,735,000 against UPSW, and remanded the case to the Court for findings of fact and conclusions of law as to whether and why UPSW should be jointly and severally liable for restitution, and in what amount, if any. On October 18, 2016, the Court ordered that the $1,735,000 payment be returned to UPSW.    O  n October 26, 2017, the Court issued an order finding UPSW jointly and severally liable in the amount of $1,735,000.  UPSW is in the process of reviewing the order with counsel and determining its next steps.  

UPSW instituted an action against a former independent sales agent in Wisconsin state court for, among other things, breach of contract. The former sales agent answered the complaint and filed counterclaims against UPSW. The court recently granted certain aspects of defendants  motions for summary judgment, dismissing certain of the claims asserted by UPSW. The case has been stayed pending certain matters under appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court. UPSW intends to vigorously pursue its claims against the former sales agent and defend the counterclaims asserted.  
    
  In October 2015, NTS was served with an amended complaint filed by a former customer of NTS alleging claims in connection with a server leased by the customer from NTS.  In April 2016, the court denied NTS  motion to dismiss the action.  In order to avoid the continued burdens and expense of further litigation, NTS settled the litigation, which settlement expense was covered by NTS  insurance carrier.  

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS. 
    
  In addition to the risk factors discussed below, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.  The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face.  Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . Risks related the Notes due 2022 were previously discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . The risk factors below include both the Notes due 2022 and 2021 as discussed in the Form N-2 filed on July 7, 2016 with the SEC. 
    
  RISKS RELATING TO OUR PUBLICLY-TRADED SECURITIES 
    
  The 7.5% notes due 2022 (the  2022 Notes ) and the 7.00% notes due 2021 (the  2021 Notes,  and together with the 2022 Notes, the  Notes ) are unsecured and therefore are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we have outstanding or may incur in the future. 
  
   170 

     Table of Contents  

In September 2015 and April 2016, we issued $8,324,000 and $40,250,000 in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes and 2021 Notes, respectively. The Notes are not secured by any of our assets or any of the assets of our subsidiaries. As a result, the Notes are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness we or our subsidiaries have outstanding or may incur in the future (or any indebtedness that is initially unsecured to which we subsequently grant security). In any liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy or other similar proceeding, the holders of any of our existing or future secured indebtedness and the existing or future secured indebtedness of our subsidiaries may assert rights against the assets pledged to secure that indebtedness to receive full payment of their indebtedness before the assets may be used to pay other creditors, including the holders of the Notes. 
    
  The Notes are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. 
    
  The Notes are obligations exclusively of the Company and not of any of our subsidiaries. None of our subsidiaries is a guarantor of the Notes and the Notes are not required to be guaranteed by any subsidiaries we may acquire or create in the future. Any assets of our subsidiaries will not be directly available to satisfy the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes. 
    
  Except to the extent we are a creditor with recognized claims against our subsidiaries, all claims of creditors (including trade creditors) and holders of preferred stock, if any, of our subsidiaries will have priority over our equity interests in such subsidiaries (and therefore the claims of our creditors, including holders of the Notes) with respect to the assets of such subsidiaries. Even if we are recognized as a creditor of one or more of our subsidiaries, our claims would still be effectively subordinated to any security interests in the assets of any such subsidiary and to any indebtedness or other liabilities of any such subsidiary senior to our claims. Consequently, the Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness and other liabilities (including trade payables) of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish as financing vehicles or otherwise. 
    
  The indentures under which the Notes were issued contains limited protection for holders of the Notes. 
    
  The indentures under which the Notes were issued offers limited protection to holders of the Notes. The terms of the indentures and the Notes do not restrict our or any of our subsidiaries  ability to engage in, or otherwise be a party to, a variety of corporate transactions, circumstances or events that could have a material adverse impact on your investment in the Notes. In particular, the terms of the indentures and the Notes do not place any restrictions on our or our subsidiaries  ability to: 

issue securities or otherwise incur additional indebtedness or other obligations, including (1) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be equal in right of payment to the Notes, (2) any indebtedness or other obligations that would be secured and therefore rank effectively senior in right of payment to the Notes, (3) indebtedness of ours that is guaranteed by one or more of our subsidiaries and which therefore is structurally senior to the Notes and (4) securities, indebtedness or obligations issued or incurred by our subsidiaries that would be senior to our equity interests in our subsidiaries and therefore rank structurally senior to the Notes with respect to the assets of our subsidiaries, in each case other than an incurrence of indebtedness or other obligation that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(A) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, whether or not we continue to be subject to such provisions of the 1940 Act, but giving effect, in either case, to any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC. Currently, these provisions generally prohibit us from making additional borrowings, including through the issuance of additional debt or the sale of additional debt securities, unless our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, equals at least 200% after such borrowings; 

with respect to the 2021 Notes, pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the 2021 Notes, including subordinated indebtedness, in each case other than dividends, purchases, redemptions or payments that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act as in effect immediately prior to the issuance of the 2021 Notes, we will not declare any dividend (except a dividend payable in stock of the issuer), or declare any other distribution, upon a class of the capital stock of the Company, or purchase any such capital stock, unless, in every such case, at the time of the declaration of any such dividend or distribution, or at the time of any such purchase, the Company has an asset coverage (as defined in the 1940 Act) of at least 200 per centum after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase price, as the case may be, and giving effect, in each case, (i) to any exemptive relief granted to the Company by the SEC and (ii) to any no-action relief granted by the SEC to another business development company (or to the Company if it determines to seek such similar no-action or other relief) permitting the business development company to declare any cash dividend or distribution notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act in order to maintain such business development  
     
   171 

     Table of Contents  

company s status as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; 

with respect to the 2022 Notes, pay dividends on, or purchase or redeem or make any payments in respect of, capital stock or other securities ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes, including subordinated indebtedness, in each case other than dividends, purchases, redemptions or payments that would cause a violation of Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act or any successor provisions, giving effect to (i) any exemptive relief granted to us by the SEC and (ii) no-action relief granted by the SEC to another BDC (or to the Company if it determines to seek such similar no-action or other relief) permitting the BDC to declare any cash dividend or distribution notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Section 18(a)(1)(B) as modified by Section 61(a)(1) of the 1940 Act in order to maintain the BDC s status as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code (these provisions generally prohibit us from declaring any cash dividend or distribution upon any class of our capital stock, or purchasing any such capital stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is below 200% at the time of the declaration of the dividend or distribution or the purchase and after deducting the amount of such dividend, distribution or purchase); 

sell assets (other than certain limited restrictions on our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets); 

enter into transactions with affiliates; 

create liens (including liens on the shares of our subsidiaries) or enter into sale and leaseback transactions; 

make investments; or 

create restrictions on the payment of dividends or other amounts to us from our subsidiaries. 
       
  In addition, the indentures do not require us to offer to purchase the Notes in connection with a change of control, asset sale or any other event. 
    
  Furthermore, the terms of the indentures and the Notes do not protect holders of the Notes in the event that we experience changes (including significant adverse changes) in our financial condition, results of operations or credit ratings, as they do not require that we or our subsidiaries adhere to any financial tests or ratios or specified levels of net worth, revenues, income, cash flow or liquidity. 
    
  Our ability to recapitalize, incur additional debt and take a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the Notes may have important consequences for you as a holder of the Notes, including making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes or negatively affecting the trading value of the Notes. 
    
  Other debt we issue or incur in the future could contain more protections for its holders than the indentures and the Notes, including additional covenants and events of default. The issuance or incurrence of any such debt with incremental protections could affect the market for and trading levels and prices of the Notes. 
    
  If we default on our obligations to pay other indebtedness that we may incur in the future, we may not be able to make payments on the Notes. 
    
  In the future, we may enter into agreements to incur additional indebtedness, including a secured credit facility. A default under such agreements to which we may be a party that is not waived by the required lenders or holders, and the remedies sought by the holders of such indebtedness could make us unable to pay principal, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes and substantially decrease the market value of the Notes. 
    
  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow and are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on such future additional indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants, including financial and operating covenants, in the instruments governing such future additional indebtedness, we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders of other debt we may incur in the future could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we are unable to repay debt, lenders having secured obligations could proceed against the

collateral securing the debt. Because any future credit facilities likely will have customary cross-default provisions, if the indebtedness under any future credit facility is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due. 
    
  We may choose to redeem the Notes when prevailing interest rates are relatively low. 
    
  On or after April 22, 2017 and September 23, 2018, we may choose to redeem the 2021 Notes and the 2022 Notes, respectively, from time to time, especially when prevailing interest rates are lower than the interest rate on the 2021 Notes or 2022 Notes. If prevailing rates are lower at the time of redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed. Our redemption right also may adversely impact your ability to sell the Notes as the optional redemption date or period approaches. 
    
  The trading market or market value of our publicly traded debt securities may fluctuate. 
    
  The 2022 Notes and the 2021 Notes are new issues of debt securities listed on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbols  NEWTZ  and  NEWTL,  respectively. Although the Notes are listed on Nasdaq, we cannot assure you that a trading market for our publicly issued debt securities will be maintained. In addition to our creditworthiness, many factors may materially adversely affect the trading market for, and market value of, our publicly issued debt securities. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following: 

the time remaining to the maturity of these debt instruments; 

the outstanding principal amount of debt securities with terms identical to these debt securities; 

ratings assigned by the national statistical rating agencies; 

the general economic environment; 

the supply of debt securities trading in the secondary market, if any; 

the level, direction and volatility of market interest rates generally; and 

market rates of interest higher or lower than rates borne by the debt securities. 
       
  You should be aware that there may be a limited number of buyers when you decide to sell your securities. This too may materially adversely affect the market value of the debt securities of the trading market for the debt securities. 
    
  Curtailment of the government-guaranteed loan programs could adversely affect our results of operations. 
    
  Although the program has been in existence since 1953, there can be no assurance that the federal government will maintain the SBA 7(a) loan program, or that it will continue to guarantee loans at current levels. If we cannot continue originating and selling government-guaranteed loans, we will generate fewer origination fees and our ability to generate gains on the sale of loans will decrease. From time-to-time, the government agencies that guarantee these loans reach their internal budgeted limits and cease to guarantee loans for a stated time period. In addition, these agencies may change their rules for extending loans. Also, Congress may adopt legislation that would have the effect of discontinuing or changing the SBA s programs. Non-governmental programs could replace government programs for some borrowers, but the terms might not be equally acceptable. If these changes occur, the volume of loans to SMBs and industrial borrowers of the types that now qualify for government-guaranteed loans could decline, as could the profitability of these loans. 
    
  Additionally, under current law, SBA 7(a) lenders must share equally with the SBA any SBA 7(a) loan premium in excess of 110% of the par value of such loans. Legislation pending in the U.S. Senate would, among other things, require SBA 7(a) lenders to share equally with the SBA any SBA 7(a) loan premium in excess of 108% of the par value of such loans, thereby decreasing the share of loan premium received by the SBA 7(a) lender. Such legislation also would impose a new fee of 3 basis points on the guaranteed portion of the SBA 7(a) loan. If passed in its present form, the legislation could serve to negatively impact the profitability of SBA 7(a) loans. 
    
  NSBF s failure to maintain PLP status or maintain its SBA 7(a) license could adversely affect our results of operation. 

173 

     Table of Contents  

There can be no assurance that NSBF will be able to maintain its status as a PLP or that NSBF can maintain its SBA 7(a) license. If NSBF cannot continue originating and selling government guaranteed loans at current levels, we could experience a decrease in future servicing spreads and earned premiums. 
    
  NSBF has been granted PLP status and originates, sells and services small business loans and is authorized to place SBA guarantees on loans without seeking prior SBA review and approval. Being a national lender, PLP status allows NSBF to expedite loans since NSBF is not required to present applications to the SBA for concurrent review and approval. The loss of PLP status could adversely impact our marketing efforts and ultimately loan origination volume which could negatively impact our results of operations. 
    
  We could be adversely affected by information security breaches or cyber security attacks. 
    
  Our portfolio companies  web services involve the storage and transmission of customers  and employees  proprietary information. Our businesses rely on our digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct its operations. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of criminal cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of NTS or third parties with whom we deal, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers  or other third parties  business operations. It is critical to our business strategy that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Although we employ appropriate security technologies (including data encryption processes, intrusion detection systems), and conduct comprehensive risk assessments and other internal control procedures to assure the security of our customers  data, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient for this purpose. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error or otherwise, and as a result our customers  data becomes available to unauthorized parties, we could incur liability and our reputation would be damaged, which could lead to the loss of current and potential customers. If we experience any breaches of our network security or sabotage, we might be required to expend significant capital and other resources to detect, remedy, protect against or alleviate these and related problems, and we may not be able to remedy these problems in a timely manner, or at all. Because techniques used by outsiders to obtain unauthorized network access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Although we have insurance in place that covers such incidents, the cost of a breach or cyber-attack could well exceed any such insurance coverage. 
    
  NTS could be adversely affected by information security breaches or cyber security attacks. 
    
  NTS  web services involve the storage and transmission of our customers , employees , and portfolio companies  proprietary information. NTS  business relies on its digital technologies, computer and email systems, software, and networks to conduct its operations. NTS  technologies, systems and networks may become the target of criminal cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of NTS or third parties with whom NTS deals, or otherwise disrupt our or our customers  or other third parties  business operations. It is critical to NTS  business strategy that its facilities and infrastructure remain secure and are perceived by the marketplace to be secure. Although NTS employs appropriate security technologies (including data encryption processes, intrusion detection systems), and conduct comprehensive risk assessments and other internal control procedures to assure the security of our customers  data, we cannot guarantee that these measures will be sufficient for this purpose. If NTS  security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error or otherwise, and as a result its customers  data becomes available to unauthorized parties, NTS and our other portfolio companies could incur liability and its reputation would be damaged, which could lead to the loss of current and potential customers. If NTS experiences any breaches of its network security or sabotage, NTS might be required to expend significant capital and other resources to detect, remedy, protect against or alleviate these and related problems, and it may not be able to remedy these problems in a timely manner, or at all. Because techniques used by outsiders to obtain unauthorized network access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, NTS may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures.

  PMTWorks Payroll, LLC is subject to risks surrounding Automated Clearing House ( ACH ) payments.

Credit risk in ACH payments arises when a party to a contract fails to deposit funds required to settle the contract. This can occur if a client of PMTWorks Payroll , LLC suffers losses or enters into bankruptcy. 
    
  Our stockholders may experience dilution upon the repurchase of common shares. 
    
  The Company has a program which allows the Company to repurchase up to 150,000 of the Company s outstanding common shares on the open market. Under the program, purchases may be made at management s discretion from time to time in open-market transactions, in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repurchased and retired 70,000 common shares in open market transactions for approximately $866,000. This program terminated on June 3, 2016. On May 11, 2016, the Company announced that its Board approved a new share repurchase program under which the Company may repurchase up to 150,000 of the Company s outstanding common shares on the open market. Unless extended or terminated by the Board, the Company expects the termination date of for this new repurchase program will be on November 11, 2016. The Company did not make any repurchases of its common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015. If we were to repurchase shares at a price above net asset value, such repurchases would result in an immediate dilution to existing common stockholders due to a reduction in our earnings and assets due to the repurchase that is greater than the reduction in total shares outstanding. 
    
  Pending legislation may allow us to incur additional leverage. 
    
  As a BDC, under the 1940 Act we generally are not permitted to incur indebtedness unless immediately after such borrowing we have an asset coverage for total borrowings of at least 200% (i.e., the amount of debt may not exceed 50% of the value of our assets). If legislation previously introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives is passed, or similar legislation is introduced, it would modify this section of the 1940 Act and increase the amount of debt that BDCs may incur by modifying the asset coverage percentage from 200% to 150%. As a result, we may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future and therefore your risk of an investment in us may increase.
