  1.  BACKGROUND AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS 
  Description of Business 
  Continental Building Products, Inc. ("CBP", the "Company") is a Delaware corporation.  Prior to the acquisition of the gypsum division of Lafarge North America Inc. ( Lafarge N.A. ) further described below, the Company had no operating activity. 
  The Company manufactures gypsum wallboard related products for commercial and residential buildings and houses.  The Company operates a network of   three   highly efficient wallboard facilities, all located in the eastern United States and produces joint compound at   one   plant in the United States and at another plant in Canada. 
  The Acquisition 
  On   June 24, 2013  , Lone Star Fund VIII (U.S.), L.P., (along with its affiliates and associates, but excluding the Company and companies that it owns as a result of its investment activity,  Lone Star ), entered into a definitive agreement with Lafarge N.A. to purchase the assets of its North American gypsum division for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $703 million   (the "Acquisition") in cash.  The closing of the Acquisition occurred on   August 30, 2013  . 
  Initial Public Offering 
  On February 10, 2014, the Company completed the initial public offering of   11,765,000   shares of its common stock at an offering price of   $14.00   per share (the "Initial Public Offering").  Net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering after underwriting discounts and commissions, but before other closing costs, were approximately   $154 million  .  The net proceeds were used to pay a   $2 million   one-time payment to Lone Star in consideration for the termination of the Company s asset advisory agreement with affiliates of Lone Star.  The remaining   $152 million   of net proceeds and cash on hand of   $6.1 million   were used to repay the   $155 million   Second Lien Term Loan in full along with a prepayment premium of   $3.1 million   (See Note 12, Debt).  In expectation of the Initial Public Offering, on February 3, 2014, the Company effected a   32,304   for one stock split of its common stock.  The Company s common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CBPX". 
  Secondary Public Offerings 
  On March 18, 2015, LSF8 Gypsum Holdings, L.P. ("LSF8"), an affiliate of Lone Star, sold   5,000,000   shares of the Company s common stock at a price per share of   $19.40  .  As a result of the sale, the aggregate beneficial ownership of Lone Star fell below   50%   of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock and the Company no longer qualified as a "Controlled Company" under the corporate governance standards of New York Stock Exchange.  On May 15, 2015 and June 3, 2015, LSF8 sold an additional   4,600,000   and   361,747   shares of the Company s common stock, respectively, at a price per share of   $21.90  .  On September 16, 2015, LSF8 sold an additional   4,600,000   shares of the Company s common stock at a price per share of   $19.85  .  The decrease in ownership by Lone Star and its affiliates to below   50%   and LSF8 s subsequent sales of common stock triggered an aggregate of   $29.9 million   in payments to certain officers and the estate of the Company s former CEO under the LSF8 Gypsum Holdings, L.P. Long Term Incentive Plan, which was funded by LSF8 (See Note 10, Related Party Transactions). 
  On March 18, 2016, LSF8 sold its remaining   5,106,803   shares of the Company s common stock at a price per share of   $16.10  .  Following the March 18, 2016 transaction and the concurrent repurchase by the Company of   900,000   shares of Company s common stock from LSF8, neither LSF8 nor any other affiliate of Lone Star held any shares of Company common stock.  (See Note 15, Treasury Stock).

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  (a)  Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements for CBP have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP").  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries.  All intercompany transactions have been eliminated. 
  (b)  Basis of Presentation for Interim Periods 
  Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included for the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted for the interim periods presented. Management believes that the unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments (which are normal and recurring in nature) necessary to present fairly the financial position of the Company and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 
  The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  Seasonal changes and other conditions can affect the sales volumes of the Company s products. Therefore, the financial results for any interim period do not necessarily indicate the expected results for the year. 
  The financial statements should be read in conjunction with CBP s audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year then ended (the "2015 10-K").  The Company has continued to follow the accounting policies set forth in those financial statements. 
  (c)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-9,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  , which provides accounting guidance for all revenue arising from contracts with customers and affects all entities that enter into contracts to provide goods or services to their customers.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , which defers the effective date of ASU No. 2014-9 for all entities by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The ASU requires retroactive application on either a full or modified basis.  Early application is permitted as of the original effective date on December 15, 2016.  The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2014-9 to determine its impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures. 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  : Presentation of Financial Statements  Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40).  This ASU defines when and how companies are required to disclose going concern uncertainties, which must be evaluated each interim and annual period.  Specifically, it requires management to determine whether substantial doubt exists regarding the entity s going concern presumption.  Substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued).  If substantial doubt exists, certain disclosures are required; the extent of those disclosures depends on an evaluation of management s plans (if any) to mitigate the going concern uncertainty.  The provisions of ASU 2014-15 will be effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and to annual and interim periods thereafter.  Early adoption is permitted.  The ASU should be applied on a prospective basis.  The Company believes the adoption of this ASU will not have a material impact on the Company s disclosures. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-3,   Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,   which changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in financial statements.  Under the ASU, an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability.  Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense.  The Company adopted ASU 2015-3 during the first quarter of 2016.  Upon adoption, the guidance was applied retroactively to all periods presented in the financial statements, therefore, prior period adjustments were made to the December 31, 2015 balance sheet items and related footnotes.  The effect of these adjustments was to reduce prepaid and other current assets by   $1.6 million  , reduce debt issuance costs by   $6.5 million   and reduce notes payable by   $8.1 million  .  The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on the Company s results of operations. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-02 to determine its impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

     Table of Contents  

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  , which introduces targeted amendments intended to simplify the accounting for stock compensation.  Specifically, the ASU requires all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies (including tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards) to be recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement.  The tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the reporting period in which they occur.  An entity also should recognize excess tax benefits, and assess the need for a valuation allowance, regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period.  That is, off balance sheet accounting for net operating losses stemming from excess tax benefits would no longer be required and instead such net operating losses would be recognized when they arise.  Existing net operating losses that are currently tracked off balance sheet would be recognized, net of a valuation allowance if required, through an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption.  Entities will no longer need to maintain and track an  APIC pool.   The ASU also requires excess tax benefits to be classified along with other income tax cash flows as an operating activity in the statement of cash flows.  The amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating ASU 2016-09 to determine its impact on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.

Amortization expense was   $3.4 million   and   $10.4 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $4.0 million   and   $12.4 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Customer relationship assets are amortized over a   15   year period using an accelerated method that reflects the expected future cash flows from the acquired customer-list intangible asset.  Trademarks are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of   15   years. 
  Software development costs are amortized over a   3   year life with the expense recorded in selling and administrative expense.  Amortization expense related to capitalized software was   $0.4 million   and   $1.2 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $0.4 million   and   $1.1 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
   
  7. ACCRUED AND OTHER LIABILITIES 

8. INCOME TAXES 
  The Company s annual estimated effective tax rate is approximately   33.8%  .  The Company is subject to audit examinations at federal, state and local levels by tax authorities in those jurisdictions.  In addition, the Canadian operations are subject to audit examinations at federal and provincial levels by tax authorities in those jurisdictions.  The tax matters challenged by the tax authorities are typically complex; therefore, the ultimate outcome of any challenges would be subject to uncertainty.  The Company has not identified any issues that did not meet the recognition threshold or would be impacted by the measurement provisions of the uncertain tax position guidance.

9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  The Company leases certain buildings and equipment.  The Company s facility and equipment leases may provide for escalations of rent or rent abatements and payment of pro rata portions of building operating expenses.  Minimum lease payments are recognized on a straight-line basis over the minimum lease term.  The total expenses under operating leases for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $1.0 million   and   $3.1 million  , respectively, compared to   $1.2 million   and   $3.3 million   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  The Company also has non-capital purchase commitments that primarily relate to gas, gypsum, paper and other raw materials.  The total amounts purchased under such commitments were   $16.4 million   and   $49.5 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $17.6 million   and   $50.4 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Under certain circumstances, the Company provides letters of credit related to its natural gas and other supply purchases.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had outstanding letters of credit of approximately   $2.1 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively. 
  In March 2015, a group of homebuilders commenced a lawsuit against the Company and other U.S. wallboard manufacturers, alleging that such manufacturers had conspired to fix the price of wallboard in violation of antitrust and unfair competition laws.  The complaint, as amended in October 2015, December 2015 and March 2016, also alleged that the manufacturers agreed to abolish the use of "job quotes" and agreed to restrict the supply of wallboard in order to support the allegedly collusive price increases.  The case was transferred to the Eastern District of Pennsylvania for coordinated and consolidated pretrial proceedings with existing antitrust litigation in that district.  The Company filed a motion to dismiss the case with respect to the Company in April 2016 and denied any wrongdoing of the type alleged in the amended complaint.  In June 2016, the Court granted the Company's motion to dismiss the case with respect to the Company, with prejudice.  In July 2016, the plaintiffs filed a Motion to Certify Order for Interlocutory Appeal seeking to challenge the Court's decision to grant the Company's motion to dismiss.  In September 2016 the Court denied the plaintiffs' motion to Certify Order to Interlocutory appeal, and, based on the Court's order dismissing the case against the Company, the plaintiffs and the Company executed a joint stipulation dismissing the case against the Company, with prejudice.  The dismissal of the case against Continental does not limit or restrict the right of the plaintiffs eventually to appeal the Court's order dismissing the case.  The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to the allegations and does not believe the lawsuit will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operation or liquidity. 
  In July 2015, the Company received a grand jury subpoena directing it to provide certain documents in connection with an investigation being conducted by the Department of Justice regarding antitrust matters in the gypsum drywall industry.  The Company cooperated fully with the Department of Justice in responding to the subpoena.  In September of 2016, the Department of Justice advised the Company that the Company has no further obligations under the subpoena and that nothing further is required from the Company with respect to the subpoena.  The Company does not believe the investigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company executes contracts involving indemnifications standard in the industry.  These indemnifications might include claims relating to any of the following: environmental and tax matters; intellectual property rights; governmental regulations and employment-related matters; customer, supplier, and other commercial contractual relationships; and financial matters.  While the maximum amount to which the Company may be exposed under such agreements cannot be estimated, it is the opinion of management that these guarantees and indemnifications are not expected to have a materially adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

     Table of Contents  

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is involved in certain legal actions and claims, including proceedings under laws and regulations relating to environmental and other matters.  Because such matters are subject to many uncertainties and the outcomes are not predictable with assurance, the total liability for these legal actions and claims cannot be determined with certainty.  When the Company determines that it is probable that a liability for environmental matters, legal actions or other contingencies has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable, an estimate of the costs to be incurred is recorded as a liability in the financial statements.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , such liabilities were not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  While management believes its accruals for such liabilities are adequate, the Company may incur costs in excess of the amounts provided.  Although the ultimate amount of liability that may result from these matters or actions is not ascertainable, any amounts exceeding the recorded accruals are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
   
  10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
  LTIP Payments 
  In connection with the March, May and September 2015 secondary public offerings and concurrent May and September 2015 stock repurchases, certain officers of the Company and the estate of the Company s former CEO earned incentive payments in the aggregate amount of approximately   $29.9 million   under the LSF8 Gypsum Holdings, L.P. Long-Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP").  LSF8 was responsible for funding any payments under the LTIP, including those referenced above.  As these payments arose out of employment with the Company, the Company recognized the payments made to the officers and the estate as an expense.  The funding of the LTIP payments by LSF8 was recorded as additional paid-in capital.  The   $29.9 million   in LTIP payments were recorded as an expense to the Company, that were tax deductible, and capital contributions by LSF8 in the first, second and third quarters of 2015.  No further payments will be made under the LTIP. 
   
  11. INVESTMENT IN SEVEN HILLS 
  The Company is a party with an unaffiliated third-party to a paperboard liner venture named Seven Hills Paperboard, LLC ("Seven Hills") that provides the Company with a continuous supply of high-quality recycled paperboard liner to meet its ongoing production requirements. 
  The Company has evaluated the characteristics of its investment and determined that Seven Hills would be deemed a variable interest entity, but that it does not have the power to direct the principal activities most impacting the economic performance of Seven Hills, and is thus not the primary beneficiary.  As such, the Company accounts for this investment in Seven Hills under the equity method of accounting. 
  Paperboard liner purchased from Seven Hills was   $11.1 million   and   $34.0 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $11.8 million   and   $34.2 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had certain purchase commitments for paper totaling   $33.0 million   through   2019  .

12. DEBT  

In connection with the Acquisition, the Company purchased certain assets from Lafarge N.A. with cash.  In order to finance a portion of the consideration payable to Lafarge N.A., the Company and its subsidiary Continental Building Products Operating Company, LLC ("OpCo") entered into a first lien credit agreement with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and RBC Capital Markets, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and Royal Bank of Canada, as syndication agent (as amended on December 2, 2013, the "First Lien Credit Agreement") and a second lien credit agreement with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and RBC Capital Markets, as joint lead arrangers and joint bookrunners, and Royal Bank of Canada, as syndication agent for borrowings of   $320 million   and   $120 million  , respectively, and drew   $25 million   under a   $50 million   revolving credit facility (the "Revolver") as part of the First Lien Credit Agreement.  The available amount under the First Lien Credit Agreement was subsequently increased to   $415.0 million   (the "First Lien Term Loan").  In conjunction with the initial issuance of this debt, the Company incurred   $15.3 million   of debt issuance costs which were being amortized using the effective interest rate method or the straight-line method which approximates the effective interest rate method, over the estimated life of the related debt. 
  On August 18, 2016, the Company, Opco and Continental Building Products Canada Inc. and the lenders party thereto and Credit Suisse, as Administrative Agent, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amending and restating the First Lien Credit Agreement (the "Amended and Restated Credit Agreement").   The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a   $275 million   senior secured first lien term loan facility and a   $75 million   senior secured revolving credit facility, which mature on August 18, 2023 and August 18, 2021, respectively.  Related to this debt refinancing, the Company incurred   $4.7 million   of discount and debt issuance costs, of which   $2.5 million   was recorded in Other Expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and   $2.2 million   will be amortized over the term of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.  Upon completion of this debt refinancing, the Company recognized an additional expense of   $3.3 million   related to losses resulting from debt extinguishment which is also reported in Other expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.  
  Interest under the First Lien Credit Agreement was floating.  The interest rate spread over LIBOR, which has a   1%   floor, was reduced by   50   basis points in May 2014, from   3.75%   to   3.25%  , as a result of the Company achieving a total leverage ratio of less than   four   times net debt to the trailing twelve months adjusted earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization, as of March 31, 2014, as calculated pursuant to the First Lien Credit Agreement.  The margin applicable to the borrowing was further reduced in the third quarter 2014 by   25   basis points to   3.00%   after the Company achieved a B2 rating with a stable outlook by Moody s.  The interest rate under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement remains floating with a spread over LIBOR of   2.75%   and floor of   0.75%  . 
  The First Lien Credit Agreement was, and the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement is, secured by the underlying property and equipment of the Company.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company pre-paid   $25.7 million   and   $35.0 million  , respectively, of principal payments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the annual effective interest rate on the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement including original issue discount and amortization of debt issuance costs was   4.0%  . 
  There were no amounts outstanding under the Company's revolving credit facility as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   the Company borrowed and repaid in full   $22.0 million   under the applicable revolving credit facility, compared to   $10.0 million   which the Company borrowed and repaid in full during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Interest under the revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the "Revolver") is floating, based on LIBOR) plus   225   basis points.  In addition, the Company pays a facility fee of  
  
   13 

     Table of Contents  

50   basis points per annum on the total Revolver facility.  Availability under the Revolver as of   September 30, 2016  , based on draws and outstanding letters of credit and absence of violations of covenants, was   $72.9 million  . 
  Total interest paid for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.6 million   and   $8.5 million  , respectively, compared to   $3.4 million   and   $10.3 million   for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Under the terms of the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company is required to comply with certain covenants, including among others, the limitation of indebtedness, limitation on liens, and limitations on certain cash distributions.    One   single financial covenant governs all of the Company s debt and only applies if the outstanding borrowings of the Revolver plus outstanding letters of credit are greater than   $22.5 million   as of the end of the quarter.  The financial covenant is a total leverage ratio calculation, in which total debt less outstanding cash is divided by adjusted earnings before interest, depreciation and amortization.  As the sum of outstanding borrowings under the Revolver and outstanding letters of credit were less than   $22.5 million   at September 30, 2016, the total leverage ratio of no greater than   5.0   per the financial covenant was not applicable at September 30, 2016.

13. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS 
  The Company uses derivative instruments to manage selected commodity price and interest rate exposures. The Company does not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes, and typically does not hedge beyond   one   year for commodity derivative instruments.  Cash flows from derivative instruments are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
  Commodity Derivative Instruments 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   630 thousand   millions of British Thermal Units ("mmBTUs") in aggregate notional amount outstanding natural gas swap contracts to manage commodity price exposures.  All of these contracts mature by   March 31, 2017  .  The Company elected to designate these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 815-20,   Derivatives   Hedging  .  For derivative contracts designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income, and is reclassified to earnings when the underlying forecasted transaction affects earnings.  The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in cost of goods sold.  The net unrealized loss that remained in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of   September 30, 2016   was   $12,000   which is net of a tax amount of   $6,000  .  No ineffectiveness was recorded on these contracts during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015.  The Company reassesses the probability of the underlying forecasted transactions occurring on a quarterly basis. 
  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $0.2 million   of losses, net of   $59,000   of tax benefit and   $0.1 million   of gains, net of   $25,000   of tax expense, respectively, were recognized in other comprehensive income for the commodity contracts.  For the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the amount of loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into income was   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $45,000   recorded in other current liabilities and   $27,000   recorded in other current assets.  As of   December 31, 2015  ,   $0.3 million   was recorded in other current liabilities and   $0.2 million   was recorded in other current assets. 
  Interest Rate Derivative Instrument 
  The Company had an interest rate cap on three month U.S. Dollar LIBOR of   2%   for a portion of the principal amount outstanding under the First Lien Credit Agreement that expired March 31, 2016.  The hedge was being accounted for as a cash flow hedge.  Changes in the time value of the interest rate cap are reflected directly in earnings through  other expense, net  in non-operating income.  The Company recorded nominal amounts in the three months ended March 31, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
  In September 2016, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements for a combined notional amount of   $100.0 million   with a term of   4 years  , which swapped the floating LIBOR on a portion of the term loan under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to an average fixed rate of   1.323%   and LIBOR floor of   0.75%  . The Company elected to designate these interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes.   The net unrealized gain that remained in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of   September 30, 2016   was   $8,000   which is net of a tax amount of   $4,000  .  For both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $8,000   of gains, net of of tax expense of   $4,000   were recognized in other comprehensive income for the interest rate contracts.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $0.1 million   recorded in other current liabilities and   $0.1 million   was recorded in other current assets.     
  Counterparty Risk 
  The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the Company s derivative instruments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s derivatives were in a   $6,000   net liability position.  All of the Company s counterparties have investment grade credit ratings; accordingly, the Company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts.  The Company s agreements outline the conditions upon which it or the counterparties are required to post collateral.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had   no   collateral posted with its counterparties related to the derivatives.

18. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES 
  U.S. GAAP provides a framework for measuring fair value, establishes a fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value and requires certain disclosures relating to fair value measurements.  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in a market with sufficient activity. 
  The fair value hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values.  The hierarchy gives highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  The standard describes the following three levels used to classify fair value measurements: 
                   Level 1 
      
    Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that a Company has the ability to access; 

Level 2 
      
    Inputs, other than the quoted market prices included in Level 1, which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3 
      
    Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability which is typically based on an entity s own assumptions when there is little, if any, related market data available. 

The Company evaluates assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring and non-recurring basis to determine the appropriate level to classify them for each reporting period.  This determination requires significant judgments to be made by the Company.  The fair values of receivables, accounts payable, accrued costs and other current liabilities approximate the carrying values as a result of the short-term nature of these instruments. 
  The Company estimates the fair value of its debt by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument using estimated market rates of debt instruments with similar maturities and credit profiles.  These inputs are classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value reported in the consolidated balance sheet for the Company s notes payable approximated its fair value. 
  The only assets or liabilities the Company had at   September 30, 2016   that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are the natural gas hedges and interest rate swaps. The natural gas hedges had a negative fair value of   $12,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , net of tax amount of   $6,000  , compared to a negative fair value of   $0.1 million  , net of tax amount of   $30,000   as of   December 31, 2015  .  Interest rate swaps had a positive fair value of   $8,000   as of September 30, 2016, net of tax amount of less than   $4,000  .  Both the natural gas hedges and interest rate swaps are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy as they are valued using third party pricing models which contain inputs that are derived from observable market data.  Generally, the Company obtains its Level 2 pricing inputs from its counterparties.  Substantially all of these assumptions are observable in the marketplace throughout the full term of the instrument, can be derived from observable data or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace. 
  Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include intangible assets and goodwill.  These items are recognized at fair value when they are considered to be impaired. 
  There were no fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured on a non-recurring basis.  The Company discloses fair value information about financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value.

Item 2.  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. You should read this discussion in conjunction with "Risk Factors," "Forward-Looking Statements," "Selected Historical Financial and Operating Data," and our financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23, 2016 (the "2015 10-K") and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, as applicable. 
   
  Overview 
  We are a leading manufacturer of gypsum wallboard and complementary finishing products in the eastern United States and eastern Canada.  We operate highly efficient and automated manufacturing facilities that produce a full range of gypsum wallboard products for our diversified customer base.  We sell our products in the new residential, repair and remodel, or R R, and commercial construction markets.  We believe our operating efficiencies, favorable plant locations, manufacturing expertise and focus on delivering superior customer service position us to benefit from an anticipated increase in gypsum wallboard demand as the housing market recovers from historic lows. 
  Our primary reportable segment is wallboard, which accounted for approximately   97%   of our net sales in both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   97%   for both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  We also operate other business activities, primarily finishing products, which complement our full range of wallboard products.  See Part I, Item 1, Financial Information - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14, Segment Reporting. 
  Paper and synthetic gypsum are our principal wallboard raw materials.  Paper constitutes our most significant input cost and the most significant driver of our variable manufacturing costs.  Energy costs, consisting of natural gas and electricity, are the other key input costs.  In total, manufacturing cash costs represented   64%   and   62%   of our costs of goods sold for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   61%   for the same periods in   2015  .  Depreciation and amortization represented   13%   and   14%   of our costs of goods sold for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   16%   of our costs of goods sold for both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Distribution costs to deliver product to our customers represented the remaining portion of our costs of goods sold, or approximately   23%   and   24%   of our costs of goods sold for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   23%   of our costs of goods sold for both the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Variable manufacturing costs, including inputs such as paper, gypsum, natural gas, and other raw materials, represented   67%   and   68%   of our manufacturing cash costs for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   69%   and   67%   for the same periods in   2015  , respectively.  Fixed production costs excluding depreciation and amortization consisted of labor, maintenance, and other costs that represented   33%   and   32%   of our manufacturing cash costs for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   31%   and   33%   of our manufacturing cash costs for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  We currently purchase most of our paperboard liner from Seven Hills, a joint venture between the Company and WestRock Company, formerly known as RockTenn Company ("WestRock").  Under the agreement with Seven Hills, the price of paper adjusts based on changes in the underlying costs of production of the paperboard liner, of which the two most significant are recovered waste paper and natural gas.  The largest waste paper source used by the operation is old cardboard containers (known as OCC).  Seven Hills has the capacity to supply us with approximately 75% of our paper needs at our full capacity utilization and most of our needs at current capacity utilization on market-based pricing terms that we consider favorable.  We believe we can also purchase additional paper on the spot market at competitive prices.  See Part I, Item 1, Financial Information - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 11, Investment in Seven Hills.

    Mill net sales price represents average selling price per thousand square feet net of freight and delivery costs. 
     Three and Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
  Net Sales.    Net sales   increased   by   $6.4 million  ,   up     5.9%   from   $108.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , to   $114.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The increase was primarily attributable to $12.4 million favorable impact of higher wallboard volumes driven by higher demand in the United States.  The decrease in the average net selling price for gypsum wallboard at constant exchange rates had a $5.7 million unfavorable impact on net sales.  Our non-wallboard products had a $0.3 million negative impact and foreign currency had a nominal positive effect on net sales. 
  Net sales   increased   by   $31.8 million  ,   up     10.2%   from   $311.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , to   $343.2 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The increase was primarily attributable to $54.7 million favorable impact of higher wallboard volumes driven by higher demand in the United States.  The decrease in the average net selling price for gypsum wallboard at constant exchange rates had a $21.9 million unfavorable impact on net sales.  Our non-wallboard products had a $0.5 million positive impact and foreign currency had a combined unfavorable impact of $1.5 million. 
  Cost of Goods Sold.    Cost of goods sold   increased     $8.6 million  ,   up     11.0%   from   $78.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , to   $86.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Higher wallboard volumes increased freight costs and input costs by $2.1 million and $3.6 million, respectively.  In addition, labor and maintenance costs increased collectively by $2.8 million, primarily due to higher volumes.  Higher wallboard input costs per thousand square feet ("MSF"), primarily related to paper and gypsum, resulted in a $1.1 million increase.  Other manufacturing costs increased $0.3 million.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease of amortization and depreciation costs of $0.8 million and a decrease in non-wallboard manufacturing costs of $0.4 million. 
  Cost of goods sold   increased     $19.1 million  ,   up     8.3%   from   $231.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , to   $250.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Higher wallboard volumes increased freight costs and input costs by $9.3 million and $16.1 million, respectively.  In addition, labor and maintenance costs increased collectively by $4.3 million primarily due to higher volumes.  Lower wallboard input costs per MSF resulted in a $4.2 million decrease.

manufacturing costs decreased $0.4 million.  Amortization and depreciation costs decreased $3.3 million and non-wallboard manufacturing costs decreased $0.1 million. 
  Selling and Administrative Expense.    Selling and administrative expense   increased     $0.2 million  ,   up     2.6%   to   $9.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $9.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase was driven by a $0.3 million increase in stock compensation expense, offset by a net decrease of other selling and administrative expense of $0.1 million. 
  Selling and administrative expense   increased     $1.6 million  ,   up     5.8%   to   $28.4 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $26.8 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  This increase was primarily driven by a   $1.0 million   increase in stock compensation expense, a $0.3 million increase in bonus expense and a $0.3 million increase in bad debt expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period 2015.   
  Long Term Incentive Plan Funded by Lone Star.    Under the LSF8 Gypsum Holdings, L.P. Long Term Incentive Plan ("LTIP"), certain of our officers and the estate of our former CEO were eligible to receive payments from LSF8 Gypsum Holdings, L.P., an affiliate of Lone Star Funds ("LSF8"), in the event of certain monetization events described in greater detail in the 2015 10 K.  LSF8 was responsible for funding any payments under the LTIP.  The secondary public offering in March 2015 triggered a monetization event for the first time and resulted in the payment of $4.2 million and the secondary public offering in May and September 2015 resulted in aggregate payments of $15.8 million and $9.9 million, respectively.  As these payments arose out of employment with the Company, the   $9.9 million   and   $29.9 million   expense was recorded on the Company's books for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, and was also deductible for tax purposes.  The funding of LTIP was recorded as capital contributions from LSF8 in the statement of cash flows under financing activities.  No payments were made under the LTIP in the three months and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and no further payments will be made under the LTIP.  
  Operating Income.    Operating income of   $18.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $7.5 million   from operating income of   $11.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The difference was driven mostly by   $6.4 million   higher net sales and the absence of any LTIP expense in the current period, as compared to   $9.9 million   in LTIP expense in 2015, partly offset by   $8.6 million   higher costs of goods sold and   $0.2 million   higher selling and administrative expense. 
  Operating income of   $64.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $41.1 million   from operating income of   $23.2 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The difference was driven mostly by the   $31.8 million   higher net sales and the absence of any LTIP expense in the current period, as compared to   $29.9 million   in LTIP expense in 2015, partly offset by   $19.1 million   higher costs of goods sold and   $1.6 million   higher selling and administrative expense. 
  Other Expense, Net.    Other expense, net, was   $5.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase in expenses from the   $0.3 million   other expense in the same period of   2015  .  The increase was primarily due to   $5.8 million   in additional expenses associated with the debt refinancing in the third quarter 2016.  
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , other expense, net, was a net expense of   $5.7 million  , an increase in expenses from the   $0.7 million   expense in the prior year period.  The increase was primarily due to   $5.8 million   in additional expenses associated with the debt refinancing in the the third quarter 2016.  
  Interest Expense, Net.   Interest expense was   $3.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   from   $4.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , reflecting lower average outstanding borrowings during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and the lower interest rate following the debt refinancing in August 2016.  
  Interest expense was   $10.5 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   from   $12.6 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , reflecting lower average outstanding borrowings during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and the lower interest rate following the debt refinancing in August 2016.  See Part I, Item 1, Financial Information - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12, Debt for further details on the refinancing. 
  Provision for Income Taxes.    Provision for income taxes was   $3.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $2.1 million   in the prior year period.  Higher provision for income taxes was driven by higher pretax income. 
  Provision from income taxes was   $15.9 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to a provision for income taxes of   $3.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Higher provision for income taxes was driven by higher pretax income.

Non-GAAP Measures 
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA have been presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as supplemental measures of financial performance that are not required by, or presented in accordance with, GAAP.  We have presented EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental performance measures because we believe that they facilitate a comparative assessment of our operating performance relative to our performance based on our results under GAAP while isolating the effects of some items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance and eliminate certain charges that we believe do not reflect our operations and underlying operational performance.  Management also believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are useful to investors because they allow investors to view our business through the eyes of management and the board of directors, facilitating comparison of results across historical periods. 
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in the same manner as we do.  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not measurements of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to operating income determined in accordance with GAAP or any other financial statement data presented as indicators of financial performance or liquidity, each as calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash from operations, and borrowings under the debt financing arrangements.  We believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our planned operations and capital expenditures.  See Part I, Item 1, Financial Information - Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 12, Debt, for a more detailed discussion of our debt financing arrangements. 

Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $85.1 million  , compared to   $50.8 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Higher cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period   2015  , were primarily the result of a   $31.8 million   increase in net sales and a   $29.9 million   LTIP payment in the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Net Cash Used In Investing Activities 
  Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $4.9 million  , compared to   $2.9 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The investing activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   primarily reflect an aggregate of   $5.2 million   and   $3.7 million  , respectively, in capital expenditures and software purchased or developed, partially offset by distributions and contributions related to our equity investment in Seven Hills. 
  Net Cash Used In Financing Activities 
  Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $60.5 million  , compared to   $45.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the Company deployed   $33.4 million   and   $40.0 million  , respectively, to repurchase common stock.  The Company also deployed   $25.7 million   and   $35.0 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, to make payments on its long-term debt.  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company received   $29.8 million   of capital contributions from Lone Star.    No   contributions were received for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses during the periods presented.  Our 2015 10-K includes a summary of the critical accounting policies we believe are the most important to aid in understanding our financial results.  There have been no changes to those critical accounting policies that have had a material impact on our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues or expenses during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  In the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial risks such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, commodity price risk associated with our input costs and counterparty risk.  We use derivative instruments to manage selected commodity price and interest rate exposures. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our outstanding debt, and cash and cash equivalents.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $34.8 million   in cash and cash equivalents.  The interest expense associated with the term loan and revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will vary with market rates. 
  Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related to our outstanding debt is somewhat mitigated as the term loan under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement have a LIBOR floor of 0.75%.  A rise of interest rate levels to above the 0.75% floor would be required to increase our interest expense and a reduction in interest rates would have no impact on our interest expense as the LIBOR specified the calculation of interest in the third quarter 2016 was below the floor.  A hypothetical 1.00% increase in interest rates would have increased interest expense by   $0.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  We based this sensitivity calculation on the three month LIBOR rate of   0.63%   as of   June 28, 2016   in accordance with the measurement date specified in the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement.   
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of   $100.0 million   and with a   4 years   term, which swapped the floating interest rate on a portion of the term loan under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement to an average fixed rate of   1.323%  .  The fair value of these interest rate swaps was   $12,000   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The return on our cash equivalents balance was less than one percent.  Therefore, although investment interest rates may continue to decrease in the future, the corresponding impact to our interest income, and likewise to our income and cash flow, would not be material. 
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  Approximately   8.6%   and   7.9%   of our net sales for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, were in Canada, compared to   7.6%   and   8.5%   of our net sales for the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  As a result, we are exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar.  We estimate that a 1% change in the exchange rate between the U.S. and Canadian currencies would impact net sales by approximately   $0.1 million   based on three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This may differ from actual results depending on the level of sales volumes in Canada.  During the reported periods we did not use foreign currency hedges to manage this risk. 
  Commodity Price Risk 
  Some of our key production inputs, such as paper and natural gas, are commodities whose prices are determined by the market s supply and demand for such products.  Price fluctuations on our key input costs have a significant effect on our financial performance.  The markets for most of these commodities are cyclical and are affected by factors such as global economic conditions, changes in or disruptions to industry production capacity, changes in inventory levels and other factors beyond our control.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   six   natural gas swap contracts for a portion of natural gas usage.  The contracts mature   October 31, 2016  ,   November 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2016   and   March 31, 2017  .  Other than the natural gas swap contracts described above, we did not manage commodity price risk with derivative instruments.  We may in the future enter into derivative financial instruments from time to time to manage our exposure related to these market risks. 
  Counterparty Risk 
  The Company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the Company s derivative instruments.  All of the Company s counterparties have investment grade credit ratings; accordingly, the Company anticipates that the counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts.  The Company s agreements outline the conditions upon which it or the counterparties are required to post collateral.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had no collateral posted with its counterparties related to the derivatives. 
  Seasonality 
  Sales of our wallboard products are seasonal, similar to many building products, in that sales are generally slightly higher from spring through autumn when construction activity is greatest in our markets.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
  Management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act")) as of   September 30, 2016  .  Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The design of any system of control is based upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated objectives under all future events, no matter how remote, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may not deteriorate.  Because of their inherent limitations, disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all misstatements.  Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. 
  There were no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
