NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

Nature of Operations  

 Citizens Independent Bancorp, Inc. (the Bancorp),
a bank holding company for The Citizens Bank of Logan (the Bank), collectively referred to as the  Company  is engaged
in the business of commercial and retail banking services with operations conducted through offices in Hocking and Athens Counties,
Ohio. These communities and surrounding areas are the source of substantially all the Company s deposit and loan activities. Secured
loans are secured by business assets, consumer assets, residential real estate, and non-residential real estate. The majority of
Company income is derived from commercial, real estate, and retail lending activities and investments. Other financial instruments,
which potentially represent concentrations of credit risk include deposit accounts in other financial institutions and federal
funds sold. 

In October 2012, the Bank entered into publicly
available Consent Orders with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions
(DFI) (collectively referred to as the Orders), which required the Bank to take a number of actions. In October 2015, the Orders
were lifted and the Bank entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the FDIC and DFI. Significant among the ongoing
required actions was the development of a capital plan resulting in the Bank meeting and maintaining its level of Tier 1 capital
as a percentage of its total assets at a minimum of 8.00% and its level of qualifying total capital as a percentage of risk-weighted
assets at a minimum of 11.50%. The Bank was also required to obtain approval from the FDIC and DFI prior to the payment of any
dividends. In August 2016, both the FDIC and the DFI released the Bank from the MOU without restriction. The Bank is no longer
required to seek prior approval of any dividends. 

On July 5, 2011, the Bancorp entered into a
memorandum of understanding (the FRB 2011 MOU) with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (the FRB). The FRB 2011 MOU prohibited
the Bancorp, without prior approval of the FRB, from: declaring or paying cash dividends, taking dividends or any other form of
payment representing a reduction in the Bank s capital, incurring, increasing, or guaranteeing any debt, or purchasing or
redeeming any shares. On August 18, 2016 the FRB released the Bancorp from the 2011 MOU without restriction. Bancorp may declare
and pay cash dividends, take dividends or any other form of payment representing a reduction in the Bank s capital, incur,
increase, or guarantee any debt, or purchase or redeem any shares as approved by the board of directors without prior approval
of the FRB. 

Basis of Financial Statement Presentation  

 These consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) for interim financial
information and with instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all
of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual year-end financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
considered necessary for a fair presentation, have been included and are of a normal, recurring nature. Operating results for the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2016. 

The accounting and reporting policies of the
Bancorp and the Bank conform to GAAP and to general practices followed within the banking industry. 

The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31,
2015 has been extracted from audited financial statements included in the Company s 2015 filing on Form 10-K. Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been omitted.
These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s
December 31, 2015 Form 10-K. 

Information is presented in these notes with
dollars expressed in thousands, unless otherwise noted or specified. 

Principles of Consolidation  

 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of Citizens Independent Bancorp, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, The Citizens Bank of Logan. All significant intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated. 

Common Stock Warrants  

 In June 2014, the Company issued warrants to
purchase 119,003 shares of common stock in connection with the issuance of common stock in the stock offering campaign. These warrants
entitled the holder to purchase the Company s common stock at 90% of the prior month s closing book value. Valid for
a period of two years, the warrants expired June 25, 2016. Allocated value of these common stock warrants was based on the Black
Scholes methodology. A total of 74,687 of the 119,003 total warrants issued were exercised. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). 
The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods
or services. The core principle will be achieved using a five step process. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  which amends the effective date for the Company from January 1, 2017
to January 1, 2018. The adoptions of ASU No. 2014-09 and ASU No. 2015-14 are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842).    This standard   requires organizations to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities
on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing requirements for leases that were historically classified as operating
leases under previous generally accepted accounting principles. This ASU will become effective for the Company for interim and
annual periods on January 1, 2019. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU No. 2016-02 on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326).  This standard
replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires
consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The amendments in this
update require a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount
expected to be collected. The new Current Expected Credit Losses model (CECL) will apply to the allowance for loan losses, available-for-sale
and held to maturity debt securities, purchased financial assets with credit deterioration, and certain off-balance sheet credit
exposures. Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. This ASU will become effective for the Company for
interim and annual periods on January 1, 2020. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU No. 2016-13
on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

NOTE 2 - EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE  

Earnings per common share are net income available
to common shareholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. The factors used in the earnings
per share computation for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follow:  

NOTE 3 - INVESTMENT SECURITIES  

The amortized cost of securities and their approximate fair values
are as follows: 

The following is a summary of contractual maturities
of securities available for sale as of September 30, 2016: 

Expected maturities will differ from contractual
maturities because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company
sold available for sale securities, U.S. Treasury and Agencies, totaling $4.0 million with a weighted average yield of 1.00% and
weighted average maturity of 1.9 years. The net realized gain on these transactions was $15 thousand. In August, 2016 the Company
purchased a $1 million taxable municipal bond at a 4.25% yield, due December 2030. 

Investment securities
with a carrying amount of approximately $2,068,000 and $2,848,000 were pledged to secure deposits as required or permitted by law
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively . 

Information pertaining to securities with gross
unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual
securities have been in a continuous loss position, follows: 

As of September 30, 2016, the investment portfolio
contains unrealized losses of mortgage-related instruments issued or backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government
or are generally viewed as having the implied guarantee of the U.S. government. As management has the ability to hold debt securities
until maturity, or the foreseeable future if classified as available for sale, no declines are deemed to be other than temporary. 

Management evaluates securities for other than
temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation.
Consideration is given to (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial
condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, and (3) the intent and ability of the Bank to retain its investment in the issuer
for a period of time sufficient to allow for any recovery in fair value. 

NOTE 4 - LOANS AND ALLOWANCE FOR LOAN LOSSES  

The following table provides information on
the activity in the allowance for loan losses by the respective loan portfolio segment for the periods indicated: 

The following table presents the recorded investment
with respect to loans and the related allowance by portfolio segment at the dates indicated: 

As part of its monitoring process, the Bank
utilizes a risk rating system which quantifies the risk the Bank estimates it has assumed when entering into a loan transaction
and during the life of that loan. The system rates the strength of the borrower and the transaction and is designed to provide
a program for risk management and early detection of problems. Loans are graded on a scale of 1 through 8, with a grade of 4 or
below classified as  Pass  rated credits. Following is a description of the general characteristics of risk grades
5 through 8: 

5   Special Mention - The weighted overall
risk associated with this credit is considered higher than normal (but still acceptable) or the loan possesses deficiencies, which
corrective action by the Bank would remedy, thereby reducing risk. 

6   Substandard  - The weighted overall
risk associated with this credit (based on each of the Bank s creditworthiness criteria) is considered undesirable, the credit
demonstrates a well-defined weakness or the Bank is inadequately protected and there exists the distinct possibility of sustaining
some loss if not corrected. 

7   Doubtful - Weakness makes collection
or liquidation in full (based on currently existing facts) improbable. 

8   Loss- This credit is of little value
and not warranted as a bankable asset. Accordingly, the Bank does not carry any loans on the books that are graded 8   loss,
instead these loans are charged off. 

The Bank s strategy for credit risk management
includes ongoing credit examinations and management reviews of loans exhibiting deterioration of credit quality. A deteriorating
credit indicates an elevated likelihood of delinquency. When a loan becomes delinquent, its credit grade is reviewed and changed
accordingly. Each downgrade to a classified credit results in a higher percentage of reserve to reflect the increased likelihood
of loss for similarly graded credits. Further deterioration could result in a certain credit being deemed impaired resulting in
a collateral valuation for purposes of establishing a specific reserve which reflects the possible extent of such loss for that
credit. 

The following tables present the risk category of loans by class
of loans based on the most recent analysis performed at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Commercial Credit Exposure  

  Credit risk profile by credit worthiness
category  

Consumer Credit Exposure  

  Credit risk by credit worthiness category  

Loans evaluated for impairment include loans
classified as troubled debt restructurings and non-performing commercial, real estate, and consumer loans. The following table
sets forth certain information regarding the Bank s impaired loans by class ,  segregated by those for which a specific
allowance was required and those for which a specific allowance was not necessary for the periods indicated: 

The following tables present the average recorded
investments in impaired loans and the amount of interest income recognized on impaired loans after impairment by class for the
periods indicated: 

The following tables summarize information
relative to loan modifications determined to be troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) during the periods indicated: 

(1)    Pre-modification balance is calculated using the loan balance on the day prior to modification
as TDR.   

A modification of a loan constitutes a TDR
when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty and the modification constitutes a concession. The Bank offers various types
of concessions when modifying a loan. Loan terms that may be modified due to a borrower s financial situation include, but
are not limited to, a reduction in the stated interest rate, a reduction in the face amount of the debt, a reduction of the accrued
interest, temporary interest-only payments, or re-aging, extensions, deferrals, renewals, and rewrites. In mitigation, additional
collateral, a co-borrower or a guarantor may be requested. 

During the three month period ended September
30, 2016, loans were modified by either a reduction in interest rates or a change in the contractual maturity date of the note.
Seven loans were modified with reduced interest rates and the amortization of three loans was modified. 

During the nine month period ended September
30, 2016, loans were modified by either a reduction in interest rates or a change in the contractual maturity date of the note.
Ten loans were modified with reduced interest rates, the amortization of three loans was modified, and the contractual maturity
date of one loan was extended. 

During the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, four loans were modified with reduced interest rates, the contractual
maturity date of three loans was extended, and five loans had the rate reduced and the amortization period extended. A single
note was converted to interest only, with a balloon payment at maturity. 

Loans modified as a TDR may already be on nonaccrual
status and partial charge-offs may have, in some cases, been taken against the outstanding loan balance. The allowance for impaired
loans that have been modified as a TDR is measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs,
if the loan is collateral dependent or on the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the loan s original
effective interest rate. Management exercises significant judgment in developing these determinations. 

There have been no loans, which were modified
as a TDR within the previous twelve months that have subsequently defaulted as of September 30, 2016. 

The following table presents the loan portfolio
by class summarized by aging categories, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The following summarizes by loan class, the loans on nonaccrual
status at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

NOTE 5   BANK OWNED LIFE INSURANCE  

In 2015, the Bank invested in whole life insurance
contracts on the lives of ten   current officers who have provided positive consent allowing the Bank to be named beneficiary
of these insurance contracts. One insured employee has since left the bank, and an existing policy on a former employee is also
in place. These policies are recorded at their cash surrender values which are presented in the consolidated balance sheets in
 Other Assets.  Those policies covering current officers are split dollar policies, providing one year s salary
to a deceased employee s estate. These policies feature variable crediting rates and are expected to produce an average yield
of about 5.50%, on a fully tax equivalent basis. 

NOTE 6     BORROWINGS  

As of February 9, 2015, the Company renegotiated
a portion of the $5.0 million note payable due December 29, 2015. An interest only note (Note B) for $1.6 million, due August 4,
2021, with a fixed interest rate of 6.00%, and 28,675 shares of the Company s common stock were exchanged for $2.3 million
of the original $5.0 million note. The remaining $2.7 million (Note A) of the original $5.0 million note continued unaltered, earning
a fixed rate of 8.00%, due December 29, 2015. 

In September 2015, the Company made a $1.0
million principal payment to Note A from available funds at the Bancorp level. In November 2015, the Bank requested permission
from the FDIC and DFI to pay a one-time dividend to the Holding Company for the purpose of retiring Note A. In December 2015, permission
was granted, the dividend was paid, and Note A was retired. 

In April, June, and July, 2016, proceeds from
the sales of OREO properties held at the Bancorp level were applied to the remaining Note B, reducing the balance by $193 thousand. 

NOTE 7     EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS  

The bank has a qualified noncontributory defined
benefit pension plan, which covers certain employees. The benefits are primarily based on years of service and earnings. 

The following table presents the components
of the net periodic pension cost of the defined benefit plan. 

NOTE 8   FAIR VALUES OF
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

Fair value is defined as the exchange price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market
for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Accounting guidance also
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy
gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under this
guidance are described below. 

Level 1  - Valuation is based on quoted
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date.
Level 1 assets and liabilities generally include debt and equity securities that are traded in an active exchange market. Valuations
are obtained from readily available pricing sources for market transactions involving identical assets and liabilities. 

Level 2  - Valuation is based on inputs
other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The valuation may be based on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset
or liability. 

Level 3  - Valuation is based on unobservable
inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.
Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies, or similar techniques, as well as instruments for which determination of fair value requires significant management
judgment or estimation. 

A financial instrument s categorization
within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

Accordingly, investment securities available
for sale and loans held for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company
may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans and other real estate owned.
These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or writedowns of
individual assets. 

The following describes the valuation techniques
used to measure certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the financial statements. 

Investment securities available for sale 
- Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices are not available, fair values are measured
using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as the present value of future cash flows, adjusted
for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions, and other factors such as credit loss assumptions. Level 1 securities
include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange or traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter
markets. Level 2 securities include securities issued by government sponsored entities, mortgage backed securities, and municipal
bonds. Level 3 securities include those with unobservable inputs. Transfers between levels can occur due to changes in the observability
of significant inputs. 

Loans     held
for   sale      - Loans
held   for sale   are   carried
at fair value.   These loans currently   consist of   one-to-four-family
residential loans   originated   for   sale
  in the   secondary market.   Fair

based   on   the   committed
  market   rates or   the

currently   offering   for similar   loans
using   observable   market data.  

The following are assets and liabilities that
were accounted for or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis: 

The following describes the valuation techniques
used to measure certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the financial statements. 

Impaired loans  - The Bank does not record
loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan losses
may need to be established. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance
with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management
measures impairment.   As of September 30, 2016, the fair value of substantially all of the impaired loans was estimated based
on the fair value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current
appraised value, the Bank records the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management
determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price,
the Bank records the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 3. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for
which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investments in such loans. 

Other real
estate owned (OREO)  - OREO consists of real estate acquired in foreclosure or other settlement of loans. Such assets are carried
on the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of the investment in the real estate or its fair value less estimated selling costs.
The fair value of OREO is determined on a nonrecurring basis generally utilizing current appraisals performed by an independent,
licensed appraiser applying an income or market value approach using observable market data (Level 2). However, if a current appraisal
is not available, the original appraised value is discounted, as appropriate, to compensate for the estimated depreciation in the
value of the real estate since the date of its original appraisal. Such discounts are generally estimated based upon management s
knowledge of sales of similar property within the applicable market area and its knowledge of other real estate market-related
data, as well as general economic trends (Level 3). Upon foreclosure, any fair value adjustment is charged against the allowance
for loan losses. Subsequent fair value adjustments are recorded in the period incurred and included in other  noninterest
 expense in the consolidated statements of income.  

The following are assets and liabilities that
were accounted for or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:

fair value measurements for financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis is as follows:

The following methods and assumptions were
used to estimate the fair value disclosures for other financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Cash and cash equivalents  - The fair
value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated to approximate the carrying amounts. 

Other investment securities  - Other
investment securities consist of restricted equity securities in the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) and are carried at cost. Because
there is no market, the carrying values of restricted equity securities approximate fair values based on the redemption provisions
of the FHLB. 

Loans  - The fair value of loans is calculated
by discounting estimated cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings
and for the same remaining maturities. The estimated cash flows do not anticipate prepayments. 

Management has made estimates of fair value
discount rates that it believes to be reasonable. However, because there is no market for many of these financial instruments,
management has no basis to determine whether the fair value presented for loans would be indicative of the value negotiated in
an actual sale. 

Accrued interest receivable and payable 
- The carrying amounts of accrued interest approximate fair value. 

Bank owned life insurance  - The
fair value of bank owned life insurance approximates the cash surrender value of the policies. 

Deposits  - The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity,
such as noninterest bearing and interest bearing demand deposits, regular savings, and certain types of money market accounts,
is equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (that is, their carrying amounts). The fair value of certificates
of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently
offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 

Borrowed funds  - The carrying
amounts of borrowed funds which mature within 90 days approximate their fair values. The fair values of other borrowed funds are
estimated using discounted cash flow analysis that applies interest rates currently offered on similar instruments. 

Off-balance sheet instruments  - The
fair values of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter
into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of agreements and the present credit standing of the counterparties.
The amounts of fees currently charged on commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are deemed insignificant, and
therefore, the estimated fair values and carrying values are not shown. 

The estimated fair value of the financial instruments
is as follows: 

The carrying amounts in the preceding table
are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the applicable captions. No derivatives were held by the Company for trading
purposes.

Management s Discussion and Analysis
as of September 30, 2016  

Overview  . Citizens Independent
Bancorp. Inc. (Holding Company, Bancorp, we or our) was organized under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1994 as the bank holding
company for The Citizens Bank of Logan (Citizens Bank or Bank) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. Bancorp
and the Bank are sometimes collectively referred to herein as the Company. Holding Company is headquartered in Logan, Ohio, and
offers a broad range of financial services through Citizens Bank, an Ohio chartered commercial bank. The Bank is currently regulated
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company (FDIC) and the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions (DFI). Holding Company is regulated
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland (FRB). 

Citizens Bank is engaged in the business of
commercial and retail banking. The Bank s primary market area is Hocking, Fairfield, and Athens Counties, Ohio. The Bank
serves this market through three full service locations, which include the Bank s main office located at 188 West Main Street,
Logan, Hocking County, Ohio. The Bank maintains drive-up facilities, as well as ATM equipment at all branches. In a cost saving
project, the Bank is presently constructing a new full service branch. This branch will consolidate a full service facility and
a limited service location, both of which will be closed with the opening of this new branch. The principal economic activities
in the Bank s market area include manufacturing, the service sector for local universities, tourism, construction, healthcare,
retailing, and food services. The Bank grants residential real estate, commercial real estate, commercial and industrial, and consumer
loans to customers primarily located in the Bank s footprint of Hocking, Athens, and Fairfield counties. 

In October 2012, the Bank entered into publicly
available Consent Orders with the FDIC and the DFI (collectively referred to as the Orders), which required the Bank to take a
number of actions. In October 2015, the Orders were lifted and the Bank entered into an MOU with the FDIC and DFI. Significant
among the ongoing required actions was the development of a capital plan resulting in the Bank meeting and maintaining its level
of Tier 1 capital as a percentage of its total assets at a minimum of 8.00% and its level of qualifying total capital as a percentage
of risk-weighted assets at a minimum of 11.50%. The Bank was also required to obtain approval from the FDIC and DFI prior to the
payment of any dividends. In August 2016, both the FDIC and the DFI released the Bank from the MOU without restriction. The Bank
is no longer required to seek prior approval of any dividends. 

On July 5, 2011, the Bancorp entered into a
memorandum of understanding (the FRB 2011 MOU) with the FRB. The FRB 2011 MOU prohibited the Bancorp, without prior approval of
the FRB, from: declaring or paying cash dividends, taking dividends or any other form of payment representing a reduction in the
Bank s capital, incurring, increasing, or guaranteeing any debt, or purchasing or redeeming any shares. On August 18, 2016
the FRB released the Bancorp from the 2011 MOU without restriction. Bancorp may declare and pay cash dividends, take dividends
or any other form of payment representing a reduction in the Bank s capital, incur, increase, or guarantee any debt, or purchase
or redeem any shares as approved by the board of directors without prior approval of the FRB. 

Management s Discussion and Analysis
is intended to provide shareholders with a more comprehensive analysis of the issues facing management than can be obtained from
an examination of the financial statements alone. This analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements
and related footnotes and selected financial data elsewhere in this filing. 

The Bank s profitability, as with most
financial institutions, is significantly dependent upon net interest income, which is the difference between interest received
on interest earning assets, such as loans and securities and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities, principally deposits
and borrowings. During a period of economic slowdown, the lack of interest income from non-performing assets and additional provision
for loan losses can greatly reduce profitability. Results of operations are also impacted by noninterest income, such as service
charges on deposit accounts and fees on other services, income from lending services, as well as noninterest expense, such as salaries
and employee benefits, occupancy expense, professional and other services, and other expenses. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company earned net income of $812 thousand or $1.20 per share, compared to net income of $428 thousand or $0.67 per share for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Key items affecting the Company s results
for the first nine months of 2016: 

Net interest income increased by $213 thousand period-over-period for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. A $129 thousand decline in interest income was offset by a $342 thousand
decrease in interest expense.   

Noninterest income decreased by $70 thousand to $1,116 thousand for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The period to period decrease can be attributed to a decline of $153 thousand
in gains on the sale of securities, partially offset by an increase of $61 thousand in other income resulting from the third quarter
purchase of a BOLI policy and a gain of $24 thousand on the sale of loans.   

Non-performing loans were lower by $0.3 million at September 30, 2016 relative to December 31,
2015, totaling $1.0 million and $1.3 million, respectively. The period-over-period activity primarily consisted of the pay-off
of three credits totaling $773 thousand and the upgrade of one credit totaling $191 thousand, offset by the downgrade of four credit
totaling $709 thousand.   

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended
September 30 ,  2016   and September 30, 2015   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company earned
net income of $812 thousand, a $384 thousand increase from the $428 thousand net income reported for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase in profitability can primarily be attributed to a $213 thousand increase in net interest income relative
to the first nine months of 2015 and a decrease in noninterest expense of $370 thousand, only partially negated by a decline in
noninterest income of $70 thousand. Federal income tax provisions were $284 thousand for the first nine months of 2016 versus only
$155 thousand during the comparable period in 2015. 

Distribution of Assets, Liabilities, and Shareholders  Equity  

For the nine months ended September 30, 

(1)  Loan fees are immaterial
amounts 

  (2)  Non-accrual loans are included
in average loan balance 

  (3)  Interest income for tax-exempt
securities is not calculated on a tax-exempt basis 

  (4)  Loans receivable includes loans
held for sale 

Interest income for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 was $6.0 million, a $129 thousand, or 2.1%, decrease from that earned during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
The yield on earning assets increased 22 basis points to 4.76% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.54% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. Interest income earned from the loan portfolio increased $29 thousand, or 0.5%, to $5.8 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in interest
income from the loan portfolio can be attributed to an increase in average loan balances of $4.1 million, or 2.9%. The yield on
loans decreased 13 basis points to 5.29% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 relative to the 5.42% earned for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. 

Interest income from the investment portfolio
declined $163 thousand, or 56.8%, to $124 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $287 thousand for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Average assets for the securities portfolio declined $15.0 million and the yield increased by
20 basis points. Securities sales during the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 totaled $4.0 million at a weighted average
yield of 1.00% and a weighted average maturity of 1.9 years. Securities sales during the nine month period ending September 30,
2015 totaled $14.4 million and purchases were $3.1 million. Securities gains recognized during the first three quarters of 2015
were $168 thousand. 

Interest expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $623 thousand, a $342 thousand, or 35.4%, decrease from the $965 thousand in interest expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense for deposits declined $168 thousand, or 24.3%, to $523 thousand for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016. Average balances of interest bearing deposits decreased by $20.8 million, or 14.1%, to $127.3
million at September 30, 2016 from $148.1 million at September 30, 2015. 

Interest expense for other borrowings was $100
thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $274 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In February
2015, the Company issued $656 thousand of common stock, retiring a like amount of debt, and reducing the interest rate on a portion
of the remaining debt. Principal payments reduced the average outstanding debt to $2.4 million as of September 30, 2016 from $5.3
million as of September 30, 2015. 

Net interest margins continue to be under heavy
pressure as higher yielding loans reprice downward, are refinanced at lower rates, or are paid off early. During the first nine
months of 2016, loans totaling $13.7 million have repriced at a net decrease of 13 basis points, mostly due to the downward repricing
of commercial loans offsetting the increased rates of home equity loans repricing from their initial teaser rates. The Bank has
continued to drive the composition of the loan portfolio towards variable rate loans and shorter maturity fixed rate loans as protection
against rising interest rates. Although striving to originate conforming residential mortgage loans, management is retaining a
larger percentage of these mortgage loans in-house rather than selling to the secondary market. The loan mix resulting from holding
these typically variable rate loans in the portfolio will depress the net interest margin in the short term, but should be additive
as they begin to reprice. The loan portfolio currently consists of 69.7% variable rate loans. The Bank has reduced interest rates
paid on a large group of deposit accounts and continues to monitor certificate of deposit rates relative to our peers. Effects
of these deposit cost initiatives are now being felt. 

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended
September 30,  2016  and September 30, 2015   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
the Company earned net income of $346 thousand, a $169 thousand increase from the $177 thousand net income reported for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Net interest income increased $58 thousand (3.3%) during the third quarter of 2016 versus the
third quarter of 2015, noninterest income decreased $261 thousand, and noninterest expense decreased $449 thousand. Federal income
tax expense of $144 thousand in the third quarter of 2016 was $77 thousand (114.9%) greater than that recorded in the third quarter
of 2015. 

Distribution of Assets, Liabilities, and
Shareholders  Equity  

 For the three months ended September 30, 

(1)  Loan fees are immaterial
amounts 

  (2)  Non-accrual loans are included
in average loan balance 

  (3)  Interest income for tax-exempt
securities is not calculated on a tax-exempt basis 

Interest income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $2.0 million, a decrease of $40 thousand or 2.0%, from that earned in the three months ended September 30,
2015. The yield on earning assets improved 18 basis points to 4.76% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 4.58% for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest income earned from the loan portfolio decreased $13 thousand, or 0.7%, for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 relative to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in interest income
from the loan portfolio can be attributed to the decrease in average yield of 14 basis points for the three month period ending
September 30, 2016 compared to the three month period ending September 30, 2015. 

Interest income from the investment portfolio
declined $28 thousand, or 39.4%, to $43 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $71 thousand for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Average assets for the securities portfolio declined $9.9 million and the yield increased by 40
basis points. During the third quarter of 2016, a $1.0 million taxable municipal bond, due in 2030, was purchased at a yield of
4.25%. 

Interest expense for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $205 thousand, a $98 thousand, or 32.3%, decrease from the $303 thousand in interest expense for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense for deposits declined $45 thousand, or 20.5%, to $174 thousand for the three
months ended September 30, 2016. Average balances of interest bearing deposits decreased by $17.8 million, or 12.4%, declining
to $126.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $144.0 million at September 30, 2015. The Company continues to trim the public deposits
by offering competitive, but not exorbitant, deposit rates. 

Interest expense for other borrowings was $31
thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $84 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015. In February
2015, the Company issued $656 thousand of common stock, retiring a like amount of debt, and reducing the interest rate on a portion
of the remaining debt. Principal payments reduced the average outstanding balance for the quarter from $5.0 million as of September
30, 2015 to $2.2 million as of September 30, 2016. 

Noninterest Income .
 Noninterest income, which consists primarily of fees and commissions earned on services, such as deposits, credit cards, and
ATMs that are provided to the Bank s customers, and to a lesser extent, gains on sales of OREO and other repossessed assets
and other miscellaneous income, decreased $70 thousand, or 5.9%, to $1,116 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
from $1,186 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The period-over-period decrease in noninterest income can primarily
be attributed to a $153 thousand decrease in gains recognized from the sale of available for sale securities during the first nine
months of 2016 versus the first nine months of 2015. The following is a discussion of other significant period-over-period changes
in other material noninterest income categories: 

Income from service fees decreased $11 thousand, or 3.5%, to $300 thousand for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 from $311 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was due to a $59 thousand
period-over-period decrease in revenue from the Bank s overdraft protection product, resulting from a change in the way we
process overdrafts. The Bank is currently evaluating strategies to recapture lost fee income.   

Sales of OREO properties generated gains of $213 thousand for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to gains of $211 thousand recognized on the sale of OREO properties during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
During the first nine months of 2016, the Company sold 13 properties with a carrying value of $223 thousand versus 8 bank properties
with a carrying value of $815 thousand last year.   

Other income increased $61 thousand, or 26.0%, during the first nine months of 2016 to $296 thousand.
The increase is primarily attributable to a gain of $56 thousand realized on the sale of three substandard, nonaccrual loans with
a carrying value of $595 thousand, as well as increased earnings of $71 thousand from Bank Owned Life Insurance policies purchased
in September 2015 on key management figures for the purpose of offsetting employee benefit costs. Offsetting this increase was
a decline of $50 thousand in mortgage broker commissions.   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
noninterest income decreased by $261 thousand, or 43.7%. The period-over-period decrease in noninterest income can primarily be
attributed to a decrease of $208 thousand in gains recognized from the sale of OREO and other repossessed properties and reductions
of $20 thousand and $21 thousand in gains on the sale of available for sale securities and service charge fees. The following is
a discussion of other significant period-over-period changes in other material noninterest income categories: 

Income from service fees decreased $21 thousand, or 16.9%, to $103 thousand for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 from $124 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease can be attributed to a
$26 thousand period-over-period decrease in revenue from the Bank s overdraft protection product, due to a change in the
way we process overdrafts. The Bank is currently evaluating strategies to recapture lost fee income.   

Sales of OREO properties generated gains of $47 thousand for the three months ended September 30,
2016 compared to gains of $255 thousand recognized on the sale of OREO properties during the three months ended September 30, 2015.   

There were no transactions or gains from the sale of investment securities during the third quarter
of 2016 versus $20 thousand in gains for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   

Other income declined $28 thousand, or 25.2%, during the three month period ending September 30,
2016 to $83 thousand. The change can primarily be attributed to an increase of $20 thousand in earnings from Bank Owned Life Insurance
policies purchased in September 2015 on key management figures for the purpose of offsetting employee benefit costs, offset by
a declines of $34 thousand in mortgage broker commissions.   

Noninterest Expense .  Noninterest
expense, which consists primarily of personnel, occupancy, equipment, and other operating expenses, decreased $370 thousand, or
6.4%, between the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to
changes in only a few categories. The following is a discussion of significant period-over-period changes for other material noninterest
expense categories: 

Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $83 thousand, or 3.5%, to $2.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 relative to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Nearly all of the increase is attributable
to the addition of two senior level employees to enhance our lending and loan processing capabilities. An additional new employee
has brought a service formerly outsourced to a third party back into the Bank.   

Net occupancy and equipment expense decreased by $66 thousand, or 9.5%, during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 relative to the same period of 2015. Most of the savings are due to the closing of an unprofitable in-store
branch in September 2015.   

Expenses on other real estate owned were $9 thousand lower for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 relative to the period ended September 30, 2015. Other real estate owned balances averaged $25 thousand for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 versus $432 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in lower maintenance and
preservation costs.   

Legal and professional fees have fallen $144 thousand for the nine month period ending September
30, 2016 to a total of $289 thousand versus $433 thousand for the comparable period in 2015. Litigation and foreclosure activity
has declined for the 2016 period as reflected in the lower levels of OREO properties and non-performing assets.   

Other operating expenses for the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 is $180 thousand less
than for the comparable period ending September 30, 2015. This decrease was driven by the 2015 write-down of $80 thousand in worthless,
discarded assets in addition to $119 thousand in additional expenses related to the closing of an unprofitable branch. During the
nine month period in 2015, we wrote-off stock received as collateral in a 2012 loan foreclosure. Previously valued at $100 thousand,
the carrying value of the stock was written down to zero. Increases of $23 thousand in employee training related costs for the
2016 year to date period were partially offset by savings of $65 thousand in temporary and seasonal employee costs as well as employee
acquisition costs.   

Noninterest expense, which consists primarily
of personnel, occupancy, equipment, and other operating expenses, was down $449 thousand, or 21.5%, for the three month period
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period for September 30, 2015. The decrease is primarily attributable to drops in
both legal fees and other expenses. The following is a discussion of significant period-over-period changes for other material
noninterest expense categories: 

Salaries
                                         and employee benefits expense fell by $6 thousand, or 0.8%, to $786 thousand for the
                                         three months ended September 30, 2016 relative to the three months ended September 30,
                                         2015. Staffing levels did not change significantly for the two periods in question.    

Net
                                         occupancy and equipment expenses decreased by $18 thousand, or 8.2%, during the three
                                         months ended September 30, 2016 as depreciation expenses decreased by $7 thousand and
                                         branch lease payments declined by $9 thousand as a result of a branch closing.    

Legal expenses were $175 thousand, or 74.5%, less for the three months ended September 30, 2016
relative to the same period ended September 30, 2015. Charges related to a since dismissed lawsuit accounted for $48 thousand of
the difference and savings attributable to the way we collect on past due and nonperforming accounts were $56 thousand. Balances
of OREO properties fell from $376 thousand at September 30, 2015 to $22 thousand at September 30, 2016, with a resulting savings
in legal expenses.   

Provision for Loan Losses .  The
Company establishes an allowance for loan losses through charges to earnings, which are shown in the consolidated statements of
income as the provision for loan losses. Through the provision for loan losses, an allowance is maintained that reflects management s
best estimate of probable incurred loan losses related to specifically identified loans, as well as the inherent risk of loss related
to the remaining portfolio. In evaluating the allowance for loan losses, management considers various factors that include loan
growth, the amount and composition of the loan portfolio, (including non-performing and potential problem loans), diversification,
or conversely, concentrations by industry, geography, or collateral within the portfolio, historical loan loss experience, current
delinquency levels, the estimated value of the underlying collateral, prevailing economic conditions, and other relevant factors.
Loan charge-offs are recorded to this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible, in whole or in part. Impacting the provision
for loan losses in any accounting period are several factors, including the amount of loan growth during the period broken down
by loan type, the level of charge-offs during the period, the changes in the amount of impaired loans, changes in risk ratings
assigned to loans, specific loan impairments, credit quality, and ultimately, the results of management s assessment of the
inherent risks of the loan portfolio. 

Management considers the current allowance
for loan losses at September 30, 2016 adequate to cover loan losses based on its assessment of various factors affecting the loan
portfolio, including the level of problem loans, overall delinquencies, business conditions, estimated collateral values, and loss
experience. No provision for loan losses was recorded in either of the first three quarters of 2016 or 2015. 

A further decline in local and national economic
conditions, or other factors, could result in a material increase in the allowance for loan losses, which could adversely affect
the Company s financial condition and results of operations. 

Changes in Financial Condition from December
31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 .  

Overview ,  Total assets decreased
$2.9 million to $180.9 million on September 30, 2016 from $183.8 million on December 31, 2015. 

Loan Portfolio .  Gross loans increased
$0.7 million, or 0.4%, to $149.9 million as of September 30, 2016 from a balance of $149.2 million on December 31, 2015. The increase
is the net effect of new origination activity totaling $23.0 million, and $22.3 million in principal reductions for the first nine
months of 2016. Principal reductions also included net loan charge-offs of $124 thousand. A single loan of $38 thousand was transferred
to OREO at its fair value of $22 thousand. The new originations were primarily commercial mortgage loans ($6.8 million or 30.2%)
and consumer mortgage ($4.3 million or 19.3%). Total consumer lending, including consumer mortgage, was 65.5% of originations during
the nine month period ending September 30, 2016. The emphasis on consumer lending is part of a strategic initiative to re-balance
the loan portfolio to be more equally weighted between commercial and consumer loans. This trend is expected to continue for the
remainder of 2016 and is incorporated into the 2016 budget. As of September 30, 2016, total consumer loans, including consumer
mortgage loans, totaled 46.9% of gross loans versus 45.0% of gross loans at December 31, 2015. 

The Company s loan portfolio represents
its largest and highest yielding assets. The fundamental lending business of the Company is based on understanding, measuring,
and controlling the credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio. The Company s loan portfolio is subject to varying degrees
of credit risk. Credit risk entails both general risks, which are inherent in the process of lending, and risk specific to individual
borrowers. The Company s credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification, which limits exposure to any single
customer, industry, or collateral type. Typically, each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level
of credit losses based on historical loss experience. Home mortgage and home equity loans and lines generally have the lowest credit
loss experience, while loans secured by personal property, such as auto loans, are generally expected to experience more elevated
credit losses. Credit risk in commercial lending can vary significantly, as losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can shift
widely during economic cycles and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions. Generally, improving economic conditions
result in improved operating results on the part of commercial customers, enhancing their ability to meet their particular debt
service requirements. Improvements, if any, in operating cash flows can be offset by the impact of rising interest rates that may
occur during improved economic times. Declining economic conditions have an adverse effect on the operating results of commercial
customers, reducing their ability to meet debt service obligations. 

To control and manage credit risk, management
has a credit process in place to ensure credit standards are maintained along with strong oversight and review procedures. The
primary purpose of loan underwriting is the evaluation of specific lending risks and involves the analysis of the borrower s
ability to service the debt as well as the assessment of the value of the underlying collateral. Oversight and review procedures
include the monitoring of portfolio credit quality, early identification of potential problem credits, and the aggressive management
of problem credits. Executive management has implemented and continues to focus on the following measures to manage credit risk
in the loan portfolios: 

1)  Reviewed all underwriting guidelines for various loan portfolios and have strengthened underwriting guidelines where needed;   

2)  Evaluated outside loan review parameters, engaging the services of a well-established firm to continue with such loan review,
addressing not only specific loans but underwriting analysis, documentation, credit evaluation, and risk identification;   

3)  Increased the frequency of internal reviews of past due and delinquent loans to assess probable credit risks early in the delinquency
process to minimize losses;   

4)  Aggressively seeks ownership and control, when appropriate, of real estate properties, which would otherwise go through time-consuming
and costly foreclosure proceedings to effectively control the disposition of such collateral;   

5)  Aggressively obtaining updated financial information on commercial credits and performing analytical reviews to determine debt
source capacities in business performance trends; and   

6)  Engaged a well established auditing firm to analyze the Company s loan loss reserve methodology and documentation.   

Allowance
for Loan Loss (ALLL) .  The ALLL represents management s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance
is actively maintained to ensure future earnings are not impacted by credit losses. Reserves are based on historical loss analysis,
assessment of current portfolio and market conditions, and any identified loss potential in specific credits. Reserve levels are
recommended by senior management on a quarterly basis and approved by the Board of Directors. 

The ALLL is composed of a reserve to absorb
probable and quantifiable losses based on current knowledge of the loan portfolio and a reserve to absorb losses, which are not
specifically identified, but can be reasonably expected. 

Following the guidelines set forth in GAAP,
Interagency Policy Statements on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses, and all other relevant supervisory guidance, the adequacy
of the ALLL is ensured by applying consistent methods of identification, analysis, computation, documentation, and reporting. 

The Bank s ALLL
has two components, the general reserve and the specific reserve. Included in the general reserve is the environmental reserve. 

The general reserve is calculated by applying
annualized net loan losses taken during a 36 month rolling look back period to the current loan portfolio, less any loans considered
in the specific reserve analysis. To reflect the variations in risk of different loan products, the portfolio is segmented by collateral
type, borrower type, and underwriting process. 

The specific reserve is the calculated impairment
of all loans classified as impaired, with a minimum outstanding principal balance of $100,000. A loan is classified as impaired
when it is probable that the Bank will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan agreement s contractual
terms. All loans classified as TDRs are also evaluated in the specific reserve. Impairment is measured based on one of the three
following methods: 

Present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate;   

Loan s observable market price; or   

Fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.   

The environmental reserve allows management
to consider qualitative or environmental factors that are likely to cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical loss
experience. The Bank s environmental reserve considers 11 risk factors which are evaluated as minimal, low, moderate, or
high risk. As the overall risk level of the environmental factors increases, the proportion of the loan portfolio held in reserve
also increases. Risk factors considered in the analysis are: 

Lending experience, with particular attention paid to new lenders;   

Exceptions to loan policy;   

Rate of total portfolio delinquency;   

Growth rate of loan portfolio;   

Exposure to commercial loan concentrations;   

Exposure to  watch list  loans;   

Consumer sentiment;   

Local economic conditions;   

Regulatory risk;   

Unemployment, with particular attention paid to local unemployment; and   

Vintage risk, with particular attention paid to underwriting procedures at time loans were made.   

Deposits.   The Company s
primary source of funds is customer deposits. The Bank offers a variety of deposit products in an attempt to remain competitive
and respond to changes in consumer demand. The Company relies primarily on its high quality customer service, sales programs, customer
referrals, and advertising to attract and retain these deposits. Deposits provide the primary source of funding for the Company s
lending and investment activities and the interest paid for deposits must be carefully managed to control the level of interest
expense. 

The deposit portfolio
decreased $4.0 million, or 2.5%, to $158.3 million as of September 30, 2016 from $162.3 million as of December 31, 2015. Noninterest
bearing deposits increased $5.7 million, relative to December 31, 2015, as a result of the reclassification of interest bearing
accounts which no longer met the criteria to earn interest. Both savings and DDA/NOW accounts declined during the period relative
to December 31, 2015. Savings declined by $0.1 million and DDA/NOW accounts fell by $6.4 million, in addition to the reclassification
decrease. Much of the decline in transaction deposits was a shift to MMDA which increased by $0.8 million (2.0%) over the same
period. Certificates of deposit increased nominally, in line with the Bank s pricing strategy of setting competitive interest
rates, but not necessarily the highest deposit rates in our market. This strategy contributed to a 20 basis points decrease in
the average cost of deposits during the first three quarters of 2016 versus the first three quarters of 2015. Management expects
these disintermediation driven reductions in cost to continue in 2016 as premium   deposit rates
are no longer offered by the Bank.  

Other Borrowings.   Borrowed funds
totaled $2.2 million as of September 30, 2016, a $366 thousand, or 14.3%, decrease from the December 31, 2015 balance. The borrowings
consist of three loans to the Bancorp from outside creditors. The loans must be repaid from Bancorp cash. As of September 30, 2016,
Bancorp s cash position was $486 thousand. 

During the first quarter of 2015, Bancorp was
able to renegotiate a substantial portion of the debt due December 29, 2015, achieving terms more favorable to Bancorp. A portion
of the $5.0 million note totaling $2.3 million was exchanged for 28,675 shares of Bancorp common stock and a new $1.6 million note
with a more favorable interest rate and a maturity date of August 2021. 

Management is engaged in the sale of the remainder
of the OREO property held at the Bancorp, which will provide additional liquidity to meet required debt servicing payments. The
Bancorp is also reviewing other borrowing avenues to ensure there is adequate cash to meet debt servicing needs. 

No FHLB borrowings were outstanding as of September
30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The Bank had an approved FHLB line-of-credit of $51.0 million as of September 30, 2016. In addition,
the Company has collateralized federal fund lines of $8.7 million with the FRB and $1.0 million with Great Lakes Bankers Bank.
Neither line was drawn upon as of September 30, 2016. The FHLB line is secured via the pledge of mortgage loans totaling $76.9
million, the Federal Reserve federal fund line is secured via the pledge of $12.0 million of automobile loans, and the Great Lakes
Bankers Bank line is unsecured. 

Federal Income Taxes.   The Company,
in December 2014, recaptured the $5.1 million deferred tax asset allowance account, which had been established in 2012 as a write-off
of the Company s deferred tax asset position. As a result of recapturing this allowance account, the Company is now subject
to reporting federal income tax expense. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded income tax expense
of $284 thousand versus $155 thousand for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the Company has
a deferred tax asset related to a net operating loss carryforward of approximately $4.7 million. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk.   Financial
institutions such as Citizens Bank generate income primarily through lending and investing activities. The risk of loss from lending
and investing activities includes the possibility that losses may occur from the failure of another party to perform according
to the terms of the loan or investment agreement. This possibility is known as credit risk. 

Lending or investing activities that concentrate
assets in a way that exposes the Company to a material loss from any single occurrence or group of occurrences increases credit
risk. Diversifying loans and investments to prevent concentrations of risks is one way a financial institution can reduce potential
losses due to credit risk. Examples of asset concentrations would include multiple loans made to a single borrower and loans of
inappropriate size relative to the total capitalization of the institution. Management believes adherence to its loan and investment
policies allows it to control its exposure to concentrations of credit risk at acceptable levels. The Bank s loan portfolio
is concentrated geographically in central Ohio. Management has identified lending for non-owner occupied residential real estate
as a lending concentration. Total loans for income generating property totaled $30.0 million at September 30, 2016, which represents
20.0% of the Company s loan portfolio. Management believes it has the skill and experience to manage any risks associated
with this type of lending. Loans in this category are generally paying as agreed without any unusual or unexpected levels of delinquency.
The delinquency rate in this category, which is any loan 30 days or more past due, was 3.5% at September 30, 2016. Management has
also identified sub-prime loans (less than a 660 credit score) and unsecured loans as concentrations. As of September 30, 2016,
loans to sub-prime borrowers totaled $10.1 million (6.7% of total portfolio), with 3.2% of these credits 30 days or more past due.
In addition, unsecured loans totaled $3.8 million as of September 30, 2016, or 2.5%, of the loan portfolio, with a delinquency
rate, which is any loan 30 days or more past due, of 0.3% at September 30, 2016. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources .
 The Company s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base, raised through the Bank s branch network, along
with wholesale sources of funding and its capital base. These funds, along with investment securities, provide the ability to meet
the needs of depositors while funding new loan demand and existing commitments. 

Cash provided by operating activities
was $658 thousand for the first nine months of 2016 and $358 thousand for the first nine months of 2015. The adjustments
to reconcile net income to cash provided by or used in operations during the periods presented consist primarily of
accrued interest payable, net gain on sale of other real estate owned, other assets, other liabilities and adjustments
related to loans originated for sale. 

The primary investing activity of the Bank
is lending, which is funded with cash provided from operating and financing activities, as well as proceeds from payment on existing
loans and proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities. 

In considering the more typical investing activities,
during the first nine months of 2016, $4.0 million of cash was generated from sale of investment securities and $2.2 million was
provided by the combination of maturity, pay-downs, or calls of investment securities. 

Financing activities consumed a net total of
$3.8 million of cash balances during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, due to the drop in deposit account balances
during the same period. Proceeds from the issuance of the Bancorp s common stock totaled $0.6 million. 

For the first nine months of 2016, total deposits
were down $4.0 million, or 2.5%, versus December 31, 2015 as the Company continues to de-emphasize large, collateralized, public
fund deposits. For the same period in 2015, total deposits were down $9.8 million. For additional information about cash flows
from the Bank s operating, investing, and financing activities see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in
the consolidated financial statements.
