NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS   

Grey
Cloak Tech Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 19, 2014. The Company was
formed to engaged in the business of cloud based software to detect advertising fraud on the internet.  

NOTE
2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America for interim financial statements and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10
of Regulation S-X of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). Accordingly, they do not contain
all information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for annual
financial statements. In the opinion of the Company s management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements
contain all the adjustments necessary (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) to present the financial position of the
Company as of March 31, 2016 and the results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The results of operations
for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the
full fiscal year or any future period. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
financial statements and related notes thereto included in the Company s form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  

Cash

Cash
includes cash in banks, money market funds, and certificates of term deposits with maturities of less than three months from inception,
which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which, in the opinion of management, are subject to an insignificant
risk of loss in value.

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

Revenue
Recognition   

We
recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement;
(2) the product or service has been provided to the customer; (3) the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed
or determinable; and (4) the collection of our fees is probable.  

The
Company will record revenue when it is realizable and earned and the computer programming services or marketing services have
been rendered to the customers. Additionally, the Company will record revenue from the sale of its software when the software
is delivered to the customer or it will be recognized ratably throughout the term of the contract.  

Concentration    

One
customer accounted for 100% of total revenue earned during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 100% of
the accounts receivable is due from this customer at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Income
Taxes    

The
Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,  Accounting for Income
Taxes . The asset and liability method provides that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax
rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company records a valuation allowance
to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized. As of September 30, 2016, the
Company did not have any amounts recorded pertaining to uncertain tax positions.  

Fair
Value Measurements    

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , which  defines
fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure
of fair value measurements.  

The
estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents are carried at historical cost basis,
which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.  

ASC
820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)
in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may
be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  

Level
2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable  

Level
3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)  

The derivative liability in connection with
the conversion feature of the convertible debt, classified as a Level 3 liability, is the only financial liability measure at fair
value on a recurring basis. 

The
change in Level 3 financial instrument is as follows:

NOTE 2 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES (CONTINUED)  

Convertible
Instruments    

The
Company evaluates and account for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815   Derivatives
and Hedging Activities  .  

Applicable
GAAP requires companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative
financial instruments according to certain criteria. The criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics
and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks
of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is
not re-measured at fair value under other GAAP with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate
instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument.  

  The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has been determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) as follows: The Company records when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic
value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common
stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under
these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their stated date of redemption.  

The Company accounts for the conversion of
convertible debt when a conversion option has been bifurcated using the general extinguishment standards. The debt and equity linked
derivatives are removed at their carrying amounts and the shares issued are measured at their then-current fair value, with any
difference recorded as a gain or loss on extinguishment of the two separate accounting liabilities. During the nine months ending
September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a gain on extinguishment of $5,123 from the conversion of convertible debt with a bifurcated
conversion option. 

Common
Stock Purchase Warrants    

The
Company classifies as equity any contracts that require physical settlement or net-share settlement or provide a choice of net-cash
settlement or settlement in the Company s own shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement) provided that such contracts
are indexed to our own stock as defined in ASC 815-40 ( Contracts in Entity's Own Equity ). The Company classifies as
assets or liabilities any contracts that require net-cash settlement (including a requirement to net cash settle the contract
if an event occurs and if that event is outside our control) or give the counterparty a choice of net-cash settlement or settlement
in shares (physical settlement or net-share settlement). The Company assesses classification of common stock purchase warrants
and other free standing derivatives at each reporting date to determine whether a change in classification is required.

NOTE
7  CONVERTIBLE DEBT   

On
January 23, 2016, the Company executed a convertible promissory note for $50,000. The loan had an original issue discount of
$6,000 and legal fees of $1,000. The loan bears interest at 8% per annum and is due on January 23, 2017. The lender has the
right to convert the principal amount and unpaid interest of the loan on or after 180 days to convert at a rate of 56% of the
lowest trading price during the prior 20 days of conversion. On July 21, 2016, the Company allowed the lender to transfer the
principal balance and accrued interest to three entities. The principal balance of the loan was increased to include the
accrued interest to date. Once the lender had the right to convert, the Company recorded a derivative liability. On August
22, 2016, one of the lenders agreed to convert their entire amount of principal and interest of $38,735 into 576,406 shares
of common stock.  

On
March 7, 2016, the Company executed a convertible promissory note for $100,000. The loan bears interest at 10% per annum and
is due on December 7, 2016. The lender has the right to convert the principal amount and unpaid interest of the loan at $0.10
per share if the market price is greater than $0.25. If the market price is less than or equal to $0.25 but greater than
$0.10, then the conversion price is $0.05. If the market price is less than or equal to $0.10 then the conversion price is
$0.02. On May 5, 2016, the Company amended the terms of the note and issued 600,000 warrants as part of the loan agreement
which was effective as of March 7, 2016. The Company calculated the debt discount based on the allocated fair value of the
beneficial conversion feature and the fair value of the warrants. The Company recorded a debt discount of $100,000 which was
capped at the principal amount of the loan. On September 30, 2016, the Company received $50,000 from the lender and extension
of the maturity date of the loan and in exchange agreed to modify the conversion rate and the exercise price of the warrants.
The Company agreed to reduce the exercise price of the warrants from $0.80 to $0.10.  

On
August 22, 2016, the Company executed a convertible promissory note for up to $300,000 and has received a total of $30,000 with
an original issue discount of $5,000 in the first tranche. The loan bears interest at 8% per annum. The first tranche is due on
August 22, 2017. In the event of default, the interest rate increases to 22% per annum. The lender has the right to convert the
principal amount and unpaid interest of the loan at a rate of 56% of the lowest trading price during the prior 20 days of conversion.
However, if the stock price is below $0.10 then the loan can convert at a rate of 46% of the lowest trading price during the prior
20 days of conversion. Additionally, the Company issued 60,000 warrants as part the convertible promissory note. The warrants
have an exercise price of $0.50 and can be exercised for 5 years. The fair value of the warrants were recorded as a debt discount
and amortized over one year.

lesser of $0.20 or 50% of the lowest trading price during the prior 20 days of conversion. On September 7, 2016, the Company
and the lender mutually agreed to remove the waiting period on the conversion and the Company recorded a derivative
liability. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the lender converted $15,000 plus accrued interest of $69 into
259,484 shares of common stock.

On

ITEM 2 Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Our
Management s Discussion and Analysis contains not only statements that are historical facts, but also statements that are
forward-looking (within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934). Forward-looking statements are, by their very nature, uncertain and risky. These risks and uncertainties include international,
national and local general economic and market conditions; demographic changes; our ability to sustain, manage, or forecast growth;
our ability to successfully make and integrate acquisitions; raw material costs and availability; new product development and
introduction; existing government regulations and changes in, or the failure to comply with, government regulations; adverse publicity;
competition; the loss of significant customers or suppliers; fluctuations and difficulty in forecasting operating results; changes
in business strategy or development plans; business disruptions; the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel; the ability
to protect technology; and other risks that might be detailed from time to time in our filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  

Although
the forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Statement reflect the good faith judgment of our management, such statements
can only be based on facts and factors currently known by them. Consequently, and because forward-looking statements are inherently
subject to risks and uncertainties, the actual results and outcomes may differ materially from the results and outcomes discussed
in the forward-looking statements. You are urged to carefully review and consider the various disclosures made by us in this report
and in our other reports as we attempt to advise interested parties of the risks and factors that may affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations and prospects.  

The
following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company is based upon, and should be
read in conjunction with, its unaudited financial statements and related notes elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, which have been prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  

Summary
Overview   

We
were formed in December 2014. We are developing a cloud based software to detect advertising fraud on the internet. We had revenues
of approximately $116,000 in the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 85% of which was from a single customer. We had revenues
of $42,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, nearly all of which was from   the same customer.  

Going
Concern   

As
a result of our financial condition, we have received a report from our independent registered public accounting firm for our
financial statements for the period from inception (December 19, 2014) through December 31, 2014, and the year ended December
31, 2015, that includes an explanatory paragraph describing the uncertainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.
In order to continue as a going concern we must effectively balance many factors and begin to generate revenue so that we can
fund our operations from our sales and revenues. If we are not able to do this we may not be able to continue as an operating
company. At our current revenue and burn rate, our cash on hand will last less than one month, and thus we must raise capital
by issuing debt or through the sale of our stock. However, there is no assurance that our existing cash flow will be adequate
to satisfy our existing operating expenses and capital requirements.

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Introduction   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, because we generated only nominal revenues, we had negative operating cash flows. Our
cash on hand as of September 30, 2016 was $74,001, which was derived from the exercise of warrants and the sale of stock, notes
and convertible promissory notes to investors. Our monthly cash flow burn rate for 2016 was approximately $39,500. Although we
have moderate short term cash needs, as our operating expenses increase we will face strong medium to long term cash needs. We
anticipate that these needs will be satisfied through the issuance of debt or the sale of our securities until such time as our
cash flows from operations will satisfy our cash flow needs.  

Our
cash, current assets, total assets, current liabilities, and total liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively, are as follows:  

Our cash increased
because we were able to raise capital from the sale of warrants, notes and convertible notes. Our total current assets decreased
primarily because of a reduction in prepaid expenses. Our total current liabilities increased primarily because of the sale of
notes and convertible notes. Our stockholders  deficit increased by $1,316,084 to $2,066,456. 

In
order to repay our obligations in full or in part when due, we will be required to raise significant capital from other sources.
There is no assurance, however, that we will be successful in these efforts.  

Cash
Requirements   

Our
cash on hand as of September 30, 2016 was $74,001. Based on our nominal revenues and current monthly burn rate of approximately
$39,500 per month, we will need to continue to fund operations by raising capital from the sale of our stock and debt financings.

the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the net cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of our net loss of $348,080,

ITEM
3 Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   

As
a smaller reporting company, we are not required to provide the information required by this Item.  

ITEM
4 Controls and Procedures   

(a)       Disclosure
Controls and Procedures    

We
conducted an evaluation, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, as of September 30, 2016, to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities Exchange Commission s rules and
forms, including to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted by us under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial
officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.
Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that as of September 30,
2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the material
weaknesses identified and described in our Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting filed in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K. 

- 15 - 

       Table of Contents   

Our
principal executive officers do not expect that our disclosure controls or internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.
Although our disclosure controls and procedures were designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and
our principal executive officers have determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective at doing so, a control
system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute assurance that the objectives of
the system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no
evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company
have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that
breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented if there exists in an individual
a desire to do so. There can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions. 

(b)       Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

No
change in our system of internal control over financial reporting occurred during the period covered by this report, the three
month period ended September 30, 2016, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

will continue until either party provides thirty days written notice of termination. The compensation for the agreement is 6,500,000
cashless exercise warrants. The warrants are exercisable at $0.12 per share and have a life of three years. The first 500,000 warrants

the principal amount and unpaid interest of the loan at a rate of 56% of the lowest trading price during the 20 days prior to conversion.
However, if the stock price is below $0.10 then the loan can convert at a rate of 46% of the lowest trading price during the 20
trading days prior to conversion. Additionally, the Company issued 60,000 warrants as part the convertible promissory note. The
warrants have an exercise price of $0.50 and can be exercised for 5 years. The issuance of the note and warrants was exempt from
registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, and the investor was accredited and familiar with our operations,

CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE   

FOR VALUE RECEIVED ,
 GREY CLOAK TECH, INC. , a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the  Borrower ), hereby promises to pay to the
order of  CROWN BRIDGE PARTNERS, LLC , a New York limited liability company, or registered assigns (the  Holder )
the principal sum of $300,000.00 (the  Principal Amount ), together with interest at the rate of eight percent (8%)
per annum, at maturity or upon acceleration or otherwise, as set forth herein (the  Note ). The consideration to the
Borrower for this Note is up to $250,000.00 (the  Consideration ). The Holder shall pay $25,000.00 of the Consideration
(the  First Tranche ) within a reasonable amount of time of the full execution of the transactional documents related
to this Note. At the closing of the First Tranche, the outstanding principal amount under this Note shall be $30,000.00, consisting
of the First Tranche plus the prorated portion of the OID (as defined herein). The Holder may pay, in their sole discretion, such
additional amounts of the Consideration and at such dates as the Holder may choose in its sole discretion.  THE PRINCIPAL SUM
DUE TO THE HOLDER SHALL BE PRORATED BASED ON THE CONSIDERATION ACTUALLY PAID BY THE HOLDER, THE APPLICABLE PORTION OF THE OID,
AS WELL AS THE APPLICABLE INTEREST, SUCH THAT THE ISSUER IS ONLY REQUIRED TO REPAY THE AMOUNT FUNDED (PLUS THE OID AND APPLICABLE
INTEREST) AND THE ISSSUER IS NOT REQUIRED TO REPAY ANY UNFUNDED PORTION OF THIS NOTE.  The maturity date for each tranche funded
shall be twelve (12) months from the effective date of each payment (each a  Maturity 

Date ), and is the date upon which
the principal sum of each respective tranche, as well as any accrued and unpaid interest and other fees relating to that respective
tranche, shall be due and payable. This Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part except as otherwise explicitly set forth herein.
Any amount of principal or interest on this Note, which is not paid by the Maturity Date, shall bear interest at the rate of twenty
two percent (22%) per annum from the due date thereof until the same is paid ( Default Interest ). Interest shall commence
accruing on the date that the Note is fully paid and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of
days elapsed. All payments due hereunder (to the extent not converted into the Borrower s common stock (the  Common
Stock ) in accordance with the terms hereof) shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments
shall be made at such address as the Holder shall hereafter give to the Borrower by written notice made in accordance with the
provisions of this Note. Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is not a business
day, the same shall instead be due on the next succeeding day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest payment
date which is not the date on which this Note is paid in full, the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken into account
for purposes of determining the amount of interest due on such date. As used in this Note, the term  business day 
shall mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which commercial banks in the city of New York, New York are authorized
or required by law or executive order to remain closed. 

This Note carries a prorated
original issue discount of $50,000.00 (the  OID ), to cover the Holder s legal fees, accounting fees, due diligence
fees, monitoring, and/or other transactional costs incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of the Note, which is included
in the principal balance of this Note. Thus, the purchase price of this Note shall be $250,000.00, computed as follows: the Principal
Amount minus the OID. 

This Note is free from
all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive rights or other
similar rights of shareholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof. 

The following additional terms shall apply
to this Note: 

ARTICLE I. 
 CONVERSION RIGHTS 

1.1 
   Conversion Right.  The Holder shall have the right at any time to convert all or any part of the outstanding and
unpaid principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest of this Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock,
as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such
Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) determined
as provided herein (a  Conversion ); provided, however, that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert any
portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the number 

1   

of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned
by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership
of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other security of the Borrower subject
to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which the determination of this proviso is being
made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.99% of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance
with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder,
except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso, provided, further, however, that the limitations on conversion may
be waived by the Holder upon, at the election of the Holder, not less than 61 days  prior notice to the Borrower, and the
provisions of the conversion limitation shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later date, as determined by the Holder,
as may be specified in such notice of waiver). The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note
shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the
date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the  Notice of Conversion ),
delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section 1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted
by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00
p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the  Conversion Date ). The term  Conversion Amount 
means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion
plus (2) at the Holder s option, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided
in this Note to the Conversion Date, plus (3) at the Holder s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to
in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or (2) plus (4) at the Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant
to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof. 

1.2 
   Conversion Price.  

(a) 
 Calculation of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price shall be the Variable Conversion Price (as defined herein) (subject
to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s
securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary
distributions and similar events) (also subject to adjustment as further described herein). The  Variable Conversion Price 
shall mean 56% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount rate of 44%).  Market Price 
means the lowest one (1) Trading Prices (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the twenty (20) Trading Day period ending
on the last complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date.  Trading Prices  means, for any security as of any date,
the lowest traded price on the Over-the-Counter Pink Marketplace, OTCQB, or applicable trading market (the  OTCQB )
as reported by a reliable 

2   

reporting service ( Reporting Service )
designated by the Holder (i.e. www.Nasdaq.com) or, if the OTCQB is not the principal trading market for such security, on the principal
securities exchange or trading market where such security is listed or traded or, if the lowest intraday trading price of such
security is not available in any of the foregoing manners, the lowest intraday price of any market makers for such security that
are quoted on the OTC Markets. If the Trading Prices cannot be calculated for such security on such date in the manner provided
above, the Trading Prices shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the holders of a majority in
interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading Prices are required in order to determine the Conversion
Price of such Notes.  Trading Day  shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the OTCQB,
or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded. If at any time
while this Note is outstanding, the lowest Trading Prices on the OTCQB or other applicable principal trading market for the Common
Stock is equal to or lower than $0.10, then an additional ten percent (10%) discount shall be factored into the Variable Conversion
Price until this Note is no longer outstanding (resulting in a discount rate of 54% assuming no other adjustments are triggered
hereunder). In the event that shares of the Borrower s Common Stock are not deliverable via DWAC following the conversion
of any amount hereunder, an additional ten percent (10%) discount shall be factored into the Variable Conversion Price until this
Note is no longer outstanding (resulting in a discount rate of 54% assuming no other adjustments are triggered hereunder). 

Each
time, while this Note is outstanding, the Borrower enters into a Section 3(a)(9) transaction (including but not limited to the
issuance of new promissory notes or of a replacement promissory note), or Section 3(a)(10) transaction, in which any 3  rd  
party has the right to convert monies owed to that 3  rd  
party (or receive shares pursuant to a settlement or otherwise) at a discount to market greater than the Variable Conversion Price
in effect at that time (prior to all other applicable adjustments in the Note), then the Variable Conversion Price shall be automatically
adjusted to such greater discount percentage (prior to all applicable adjustments in this Note) until this Note is no longer outstanding.
Each time, while this Note is outstanding, the Borrower enters into a Section 3(a)(9) transaction (including but not limited to
the issuance of new promissory notes or of a replacement promissory note), or Section 3(a)(10) transaction, in which any 3  rd  
party has a look back period greater than the look back period in effect under the Note at that time (currently a twenty (20) Trading
Day look back period as described in this Section 1.2(a) applies), then the Holder s look back period shall automatically
be adjusted to such greater number of days until this Note is no longer outstanding. The Borrower shall give written notice to
the Holder, with the adjusted Variable Conversion Price and/or adjusted look back period (each adjustment that is applicable due
to the triggering event), within one (1) business day of an event that requires any adjustment described in the two immediately
preceding sentences.   

Holder shall be entitled
to deduct $500.00 from the conversion amount in each Notice of Conversion to cover Holder s deposit fees associated with
each Notice of Conversion. 

3   

1.3 
   Authorized Shares.  The Borrower covenants that during the period the conversion right exists, the Borrower will
reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide for
the issuance of Common Stock upon the full conversion of this Note. The Borrower is required at all times to have authorized and
reserved ten times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note (based on the Conversion Price
of the Notes in effect from time to time)(the  Reserved Amount ). The Reserved Amount shall be increased from time
to time in accordance with the Borrower s obligations hereunder. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares
will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. In addition, if the Borrower shall issue any securities or make
any change to its capital structure which would change the number of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes shall be convertible
at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make proper provision so that thereafter there shall
be a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of the outstanding
Notes. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to
its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates
for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note. 

If, at any time the Borrower
does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of the Note. 

1.4 
   Method of Conversion.  

(a) 
 Mechanics of Conversion. Subject to Section 1.1, this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time
from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other
reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject
to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower. 

(b) 
 Surrender of Note Upon Conversion. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion of this Note
in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower unless
the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the
principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the
Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In the event of any dispute
or discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall,  prima   facie,  be controlling and determinative in the absence
of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as aforesaid, the Holder may not transfer
this Note unless the Holder first physically 

4   

surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon
the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder (upon
payment by the Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal
amount of this Note. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions
of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note represented
by this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof. 

(c) 
 Payment of Taxes. The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer involved
in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion of this Note in a name other
than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver any such shares or other
securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian in whose street name such
shares are to be held for the Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Borrower the amount
of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been paid. 

(d) 
 Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion. Upon receipt by the Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail
(or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the requirements for conversion as provided in this
Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered to or upon the order of the Holder certificates
for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within two (2) business days after such receipt (the  Deadline )
(and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof, surrender of this Note) in accordance with
the terms hereof. 

(e) 
 Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock. Upon receipt by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall
be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the
amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults
on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith
terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion.
If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver
the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder
to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person
or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder
of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of
any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower
to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The 

5   

Conversion Date specified in the Notice of
Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received by the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York,
New York time, on such date. 

(f) 
 Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer. In lieu of delivering physical certificates representing the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC ) Fast Automated
Securities Transfer ( FAST ) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions contained in
Section 1.1 and in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit
the Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through
its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system. 

(g) 
 Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline. Without in any way limiting the Holder s right to pursue other
remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline (other than a failure due to the circumstances described in Section 1.3
above, which failure shall be governed by such Section) the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $2,000 per day in cash, for each day
beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock. Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth
day of the month following the month in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower
by the first day of the month following the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note,
in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall
be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a
valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right
are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained
in this Section 1.4(g) are justified. 

1.5 
    Concerning the Shares.  The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note may not be sold or transferred
unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer
agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope customary for opinions
of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred pursuant
to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 under the Act (or a successor
rule) ( Rule 144 ) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an  affiliate  (as defined in Rule 144) of the
Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section 1.5 and who is an Accredited
Investor. Except as otherwise provided (and subject to the removal provisions set forth below), until such time as the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note have been registered under the 

6   

Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to
Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each
certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration
statement or that has not been sold pursuant to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the
legend, shall bear a legend substantially in the following form, as appropriate: 

NEITHER
THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE
HAVE BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT
BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN
A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE
144A UNDER SAID ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT
OR OTHER LOAN OR FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES.       

The legend set forth above
shall be removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i) the
Borrower or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel, in form, substance and scope customary for opinions of
counsel in comparable transactions, to the effect that a public sale or transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration
under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted by the Borrower so that the sale or transfer is effected or (ii) in the case of
the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder under an effective registration
statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities
as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Borrower does not accept the opinion of counsel
provided by the Holder with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration, such as Rule 144
or Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note. 

1.6 
   Trading Market Limitations.  Unless permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the principal securities
market on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded, in no event shall the Borrower issue upon conversion of or otherwise
pursuant to this Note more than the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that the Borrower can issue pursuant to any rule of
the principal United States securities market on which 

7   

the Common Stock is then traded (the  Maximum
Share Amount ), which shall be 4.99% of the total shares currently outstanding, subject to equitable adjustment from time
to time for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, capital reorganizations and similar events relating to the Common Stock
occurring after the date hereof. Once the Maximum Share Amount has been issued, if the Borrower fails to eliminate any prohibitions
under applicable law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange, interdealer quotation system or other self-regulatory organization
with jurisdiction over the Borrower or any of its securities on the Borrower s ability to issue shares of Common Stock in
excess of the Maximum Share Amount, in lieu of any further right to convert this Note, this will be considered an Event of Default
under Section 3.3 of the Note. 

1.7 
   Status as Shareholder.  Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by a Holder, (i) the shares covered thereby
(other than the shares, if any, which cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Holder s allocated portion
of the Reserved Amount or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii) the Holder s
rights as a Holder of such converted portion of this Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right to receive certificates
for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in equity to such Holder because
of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Holder has not received
certificates for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the expiration of the Deadline with respect
to a conversion of any portion of this Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects to retain its status as a
holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder shall regain the rights of a Holder of this Note with respect to
such unconverted portions of this Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted Note to the Holder
or, if the Note has not been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note has not been converted.
In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right to receive Conversion
Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default and any subsequent Conversion
Default and (ii) the right to have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined in accordance with Section
1.3) for the Borrower s failure to convert this Note. 

ARTICLE II. 
  CERTAIN COVENANTS 

2.1 
   Distributions on Capital Stock.  So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation under this Note, the Borrower
shall not without the Holder s written consent (a) pay, declare or set apart for such payment, any dividend or other distribution
(whether in cash, property or other securities) on shares of capital stock other than dividends on shares of Common Stock solely
in the form of additional shares of Common Stock or (b) directly or indirectly or through any subsidiary make any other payment
or distribution in respect of its capital stock except for distributions pursuant to any shareholders  rights plan which
is approved by a majority of the Borrower s disinterested directors. 

8   

2.2 
   Restriction on Stock Repurchases.  So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation under this Note, the Borrower
shall not without the Holder s written consent redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (whether for cash or in exchange for
property or other securities or otherwise) in any one transaction or series of related transactions any shares of capital stock
of the Borrower or any warrants, rights or options to purchase or acquire any such shares. 

ARTICLE III. 
 EVENTS OF DEFAULT 

If any of the following
events of default (each, an  Event of Default ) shall occur: 

3.1 
   Failure to Pay Principal or Interest.  The Borrower fails to pay the principal hereof or interest thereon when
due on this Note, whether at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, and such breach continues for a period of five (5) days. 

3.2 
   Conversion and the Shares.  The Borrower fails to reserve a sufficient amount of shares of common stock as required
under the terms of this Note (including Section 1.3 of this Note)(and such breach continues for a period of five (5) days), fails
to issue shares of Common Stock to the Holder (or announces or threatens in writing that it will not honor its obligation to do
so) upon exercise by the Holder of the conversion rights of the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Note, fails to transfer
or cause its transfer agent to transfer (issue) (electronically or in certificated form) shares of Common Stock issued to the Holder
upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note as and when required by this Note, the Borrower directs its transfer agent
not to transfer or delays, impairs, and/or hinders its transfer agent in transferring (or issuing) (electronically or in certificated
form) shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Holder upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note as and when required
by this Note, or fails to remove (or directs its transfer agent not to remove or impairs, delays, and/or hinders its transfer agent
from removing) any restrictive legend (or to withdraw any stop transfer instructions in respect thereof) on any shares of Common
Stock issued to the Holder upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note as and when required by this Note (or makes any
written announcement, statement or threat that it does not intend to honor the obligations described in this paragraph) and any
such failure shall continue uncured (or any written announcement, statement or threat not to honor its obligations shall not be
rescinded in writing) for two (2) business days after the Holder shall have delivered a Notice of Conversion. It is an obligation
of the Borrower to remain current in its obligations to its transfer agent. It shall be an event of default of this Note, if a
conversion of this Note is delayed, hindered or frustrated due to a balance owed by the Borrower to its transfer agent. If at the
option of the Holder, the Holder advances any funds to the Borrower s transfer agent in order to process a conversion, such
advanced funds shall be paid by the Borrower to the Holder within five (5) business days of a demand from the Holder, either in
cash or as an addition to the balance of the Note, and such choice of payment method is at the discretion of the Borrower.

the rights of the Holder with respect to this Note. 

3.5 
   Receiver or Trustee.  The Borrower or any subsidiary of the Borrower shall make an assignment for the benefit
of creditors, or apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver or trustee for it or for a substantial part of its property
or business, or such a receiver or trustee shall otherwise be appointed. 

3.6

   Cessation of Operations.  Any cessation of operations by Borrower or Borrower admits it is otherwise generally
unable to pay its debts as such debts become due, provided, however, that any disclosure of the Borrower s ability to continue
as a  going concern  shall not be an admission that the Borrower cannot pay its debts as they become due, or any disposition
or conveyance of any material asset of the Company. 

3.12 
   Financial Statement Restatement.  The Borrower replaces its auditor, or any restatement of any financial statements
filed by the Borrower with the SEC for any date or period from two years prior to the Issue Date of this Note and until this Note
is no longer outstanding, if the result of such restatement would, by comparison to the unrestated financial statement, have constituted
a material adverse effect on the rights of the Holder with respect to this Note.

or any other 3  rd   party (the  Other Agreements ),
after the passage of all applicable notice and cure or grace periods, shall, at the option of the Holder, be considered a default

this Note by reason of a default under said Other Agreement or hereunder.   

3.15   Inside Information.

Upon the occurrence and
during the continuation of any Event of Default specified in Section 3.1 (solely with respect to failure to pay the principal hereof
or interest thereon when due 

11   

at the Maturity Date), the Note shall become
immediately due and payable and the Borrower shall pay to the Holder, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, an amount
equal to the Default Sum (as defined herein). UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND DURING THE CONTINUATION OF ANY EVENT OF DEFAULT SPECIFIED
IN SECTION 3.2, THE NOTE SHALL BECOME IMMEDIATELY DUE AND PAYABLE AND THE BORROWER SHALL PAY TO THE HOLDER, IN FULL SATISFACTION
OF ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER, AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO: (Y) THE DEFAULT SUM (AS DEFINED HEREIN); MULTIPLIED BY (Z) TWO (2). Upon the
occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default specified in Sections 3.1 (solely with respect to failure to pay
the principal hereof or interest thereon when due on this Note or upon acceleration), 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11,
3.12, 3.13, 3.14, 3.15, and/or 3.16 exercisable through the delivery of written notice to the Borrower by such Holders (the  Default
Notice ), and upon the occurrence of an Event of Default specified the remaining sections of Articles III (other than failure
to pay the principal hereof or interest thereon at the Maturity Date specified in Section 3,1 hereof), the Note shall become immediately
due and payable and the Borrower shall pay to the Holder, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, an amount equal to
200% multiplied by the then outstanding entire balance of the Note (including principal and accrued and unpaid interest) plus Default
Interest, if any, plus any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.4(g) hereof (collectively, in the aggregate of all
of the above, the  Default Sum ), and all other amounts payable hereunder shall immediately become due and payable,
all without demand, presentment or notice, all of which hereby are expressly waived, together with all costs, including, without
limitation, legal fees and expenses, of collection, and the Holder shall be entitled to exercise all other rights and remedies
available at law or in equity. 

If the Borrower fails
to pay the Default Amount within five (5) business days of written notice that such amount is due and payable, then the Holder
shall have the right at any time, so long as the Borrower remains in default (and so long and to the extent that there are sufficient
authorized shares), to require the Borrower, upon written notice, to immediately issue, in lieu of the Default Amount, the number
of shares of Common Stock of the Borrower equal to the Default Amount divided by the Conversion Price then in effect, subject to
issuance in tranches due to the beneficial ownership limitations contained in this Note. 

ARTICLE IV. 
 MISCELLANEOUS 

4.1 
   Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver . No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in the exercise of any power,
right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right
or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privileges. All rights and remedies existing
hereunder are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

4.3 
   Amendments.  This Note and any provision hereof may only be amended by an instrument in writing signed by the
Borrower and the Holder. The term  Note  and all reference thereto, as used throughout this instrument, shall mean
this instrument 

13   

as originally executed,
or if later amended or supplemented, then as so amended or supplemented. 

4.4 
   Assignability . This Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and assigns, and shall inure to
be the benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns. Each transferee of this Note must be an  accredited investor 
(as defined in Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Act). Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the contrary, this Note may be pledged as
collateral in connection with a bona fide margin account or other lending arrangement. 

4.5 
   Cost of Collection.  If default is made in the payment of this Note, the Borrower shall pay the Holder hereof
costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys  fees. 

4.6 
   Governing Law.  This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York
without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Note shall be brought only in the state and/or federal courts of New York, NY. The parties to this Note hereby
irrevocably waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder and shall not assert any defense based
on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon  forum non conveniens . The Borrower and Holder waive trial by jury. The prevailing
party shall be entitled to recover from the other party its reasonable attorney's fees and costs. In the event that any provision
of this Note or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or
rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified
to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of any agreement. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service
of process and consents to process being served in any suit, action or proceeding in connection with this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery)
to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such service shall constitute good
and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in any way any right to
serve process in any other manner permitted by law. 

4.7 
   Certain Amounts.  Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is required to pay an amount in excess of the outstanding
principal amount (or the portion thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and unpaid interest plus Default Interest
on such interest, the Borrower and the Holder agree that the actual damages to the Holder from the receipt of cash payment on this
Note may be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower represents stipulated damages and not a penalty
and is 

14   

intended to compensate the Holder in part
for loss of the opportunity to convert this Note and to earn a return from the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion
of this Note at a price in excess of the price paid for such shares pursuant to this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree
that such amount of stipulated damages is not plainly disproportionate to the possible loss to the Holder from the receipt of a
cash payment without the opportunity to convert this Note into shares of Common Stock. 

4.8 
   Remedies.  The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm
to the Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Borrower acknowledges
that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach
or threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other
available remedies at law or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction or injunctions restraining,
preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof, without the necessity
of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. 

4.9 
    Prepayment.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note, the Borrower may prepay any amount
outstanding under this Note, during the initial 30 day period after the issuance of this Note, by making a payment to the Holder
of an amount in cash equal to 115% multiplied the amount that the Borrower is prepaying, subject to the Holder s prior written
acceptance in Holder s sole discretion. Further, the Borrower may prepay any amount outstanding under this Note, from the
31  st   day through the 60  th  
day after the issuance of this Note, by making a payment to the Holder of an amount in cash equal to 120% multiplied the amount
that the Borrower is prepaying, subject to the Holder s prior written acceptance in Holder s sole discretion. Further,
the Borrower may prepay any amount outstanding under this Note, from the 61  st  
day through the 90  th   day after the issuance of this
Note, by making a payment to the Holder of an amount in cash equal to 125% multiplied the amount that the Borrower is prepaying,
subject to the Holder s prior written acceptance in Holder s sole discretion. Further, the Borrower may prepay any
amount outstanding under this Note, from the 91  st   day
through the 120  th   day after the issuance of this Note,
by making a payment to the Holder of an amount in cash equal to 130% multiplied the amount that the Borrower is prepaying, subject
to the Holder s prior written acceptance in Holder s sole discretion. Further, the Borrower may prepay any amount outstanding

opportunity to the Holder as described above, and the process detailed above shall be repeated. The Offer Notice must be sent via
electronic mail to  Info@CrownBridgeCapital.com   .

CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE   

  FOR VALUE RECEIVED ,  GREY
CLOAK TECH INC.  a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the  Borrower ), hereby promises to pay to the order of
 OAKMORE OPPORTUNITY FUND I LP  a Delaware limited partnership, or registered assigns (the  Holder ) the sum of
 $55,000.00  together with any interest as set forth herein, on  May 1, 2017  (the  Maturity Date ), and
to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance hereof at the rate of twelve (12%) (the  Interest Rate ) per annum
from the date hereof (the  Issue Date ) until the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or upon acceleration
or by prepayment or otherwise. This Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part except as otherwise explicitly set forth herein.
Any amount of principal or interest on this Note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of twenty-two (22%)
per annum from the due date thereof until the same is paid ( Default Interest ). Interest shall commence accruing
on the date that the Note is fully paid and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days
elapsed. All payments due hereunder (to the extent not converted into common stock, no par value per share (the  Common Stock )
in accordance with the terms hereof) shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments shall be made
at such address as the Holder shall hereafter give to the Borrower by written notice made in accordance with the provisions of
this Note. Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is not a business day, the
same shall instead be due on the next succeeding day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest payment date which
is not the date on which this Note is paid in full, the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken into account for purposes
of determining the amount of interest due on such date. As used in this Note, the term  business day  shall mean any
day other than a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which commercial banks in the city of New York, New York are authorized or required
by law or executive order to remain closed. Each capitalized term used herein, and not otherwise defined, shall have the meaning
ascribed thereto in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated the date hereof, pursuant to which this Note was originally
issued (the  Purchase Agreement ). 

1   

This Note
is free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive
rights or other similar rights of shareholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof. 

 The following
terms shall apply to this Note: 

  ARTICLE
I.  CONVERSION RIGHTS 

  1.1.                
   Conversion Right . The Holder shall have the right from time to time, and at any time
during the period beginning on the date which is one hundred eighty one (181) days following the date of this Note and ending on
the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined in Article III) pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) or Article III, each in respect of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this Note to convert all or any
part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note into fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock, as
such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such
Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) determined
as provided herein (a  Conversion );  provided ,  however , that in no event shall the Holder be
entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the
number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may
be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion
of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained
herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which
the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more
than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso The number of shares
of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined
below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the  Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section
1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably
expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the  Conversion
Date ). The term  Conversion Amount  means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal
amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion  plus  (2) at the Holder s option, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date,  plus  (3)
at the Holder s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or
(2)  plus  (4) at the Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g)
hereof.  

  1.2.                
   Conversion Price .  

2   

a)                   
   Calculation of Conversion Price . The conversion price (the  Conversion Price )
shall equal the Variable Conversion Price (as defined herein) (subject to equitable adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends
or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any subsidiary of the Borrower,
combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). The  Variable Conversion
Price  shall mean 50% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount rate of 50%).  Market
Price  means the lowest Trading Price (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the twenty (20) Trading Day period ending
on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date.  Trading Price  means, for any security as of any
date, the closing bid price on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or applicable trading market (the  OTCQB ) as reported
by a reliable reporting service ( Reporting Service ) designated by the Holder (i.e. Bloomberg) or, if the OTCQB is
not the principal trading market for such security, the closing bid price of such security on the principal securities exchange
or trading market where such security is listed or traded or, if no closing bid price of such security is available in any of the
foregoing manners, the average of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security that are listed in the  pink
sheets  by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such security on such date in
the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower and the holders
of a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading Price is required in order to determine
the Conversion Price of such Notes.   Provided ,  however   ,  that if the closing bid price for the common
stock on the Clearing Date (defined below) is lower than the Closing Bid Price, then the Conversion Price shall be adjusted such
that the discount rate shall be taken from the closing bid price on the Clearing Date, and the Company shall issue additional shares
to the Holder to reflect such adjusted Conversion Price; and provided further, that if the Company s common stock becomes
chilled by Deposit Trust Corporation (DTC) at the time that any portion of the principal and interest of this Note is converted
by Holder, than the Variable Conversion Price shall be forty percent (representing a discount of 60%) for so long as the Common
Stock is chilled. For purposes of this Agreement, the Clearing Date shall be on the date in which the Conversion Shares are deposited
into the Holder s brokerage account and Holder s broker has confirmed with Holder that the Holder may execute trades
of the Conversion Shares without restriction. If such notice is received from the broker by the Holder after 12:00 PM Eastern Standard
Time, the notice shall be deemed to have been received on the next Trading Day.  Trading Day  shall mean any day on
which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the OTCQB, or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market
on which the Common Stock is then being traded.   The Company shall be responsible for the full cost and expense in connection
with the issuance and delivery (expedited) of shares to the Borrower holder, including, but not limited to the cost and issuance
fees that may be charged by the Company s transfer agent to the holder upon each Conversion Notice. In the event the transfer
agent assess a cash charge to the Borrower upon any conversion, the Borrower may at its election deduct the entire cost from the
principal amount being converted.     

  b)                   
   Holder s Right of Alternative Conversion Price . If the Company in any manner
issues or sells or enters into any agreement to issue or sell, any Common Stock or Convertible Securities (any such securities,
 Variable Price Securities ) after the Closing Date that are issuable pursuant to such agreement or convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Options or Convertible Securities, as applicable, at
a price which varies or may vary with the market price of the shares of Common Stock, including  

3   

by way of one or more reset(s)
to a fixed price, but exclusive of such formulations reflecting customary anti-dilution provisions (such as share splits, share
combinations, share dividends and similar transactions) (each of the formulations for such variable price being herein referred
to as, the  Other Variable Price ), and the Other Variable Price is greater than the Variable Conversion Price then
in effect under this Note, the Company shall provide written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Buyer on
the date of such agreement and/or the issuance of such Convertible Securities or Options, as applicable. From and after the date
the Company enters into such agreement or issues any such Variable Price Securities, the Buyer shall have the right, but not the
obligation, in its sole discretion to substitute the Other Variable Price for the Conversion Price upon conversion of this Note
by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered upon any conversion of this Note that solely for purposes of such conversion
the Buyer is relying on the Other Variable Price rather than the Conversion Price then in effect. The Buyer s election to
rely on the Other Variable Price for a particular conversion of this Note shall not obligate the Holder to rely on the Other Variable
Price for any future conversion of this Note. 

  c)                   
   Conversion Price During Major Announcements . Notwithstanding anything contained in
Section 1.2(a) to the contrary, in the event the Borrower (i) makes a public announcement that it intends to consolidate or merge
with any other corporation (other than a merger in which the Borrower is the surviving or continuing corporation and its capital
stock is unchanged) or sell or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or (ii) any person, group or entity
(including the Borrower) publicly announces a tender offer to purchase 50% or more of the Borrower s Common Stock (or any
other takeover scheme) (the date of the announcement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) is hereinafter referred to as the  Announcement
Date ), then the Conversion Price shall, effective upon the Announcement Date and continuing through the Adjusted Conversion
Price Termination Date (as defined below), be equal to the lower of (x) the Conversion Price which would have been applicable for
a Conversion occurring on the Announcement Date and (y) the Conversion Price that would otherwise be in effect. From and after
the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date, the Conversion Price shall be determined as set forth in this Section 1.2(a). For
purposes hereof,  Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date  shall mean, with respect to any proposed transaction
or tender offer (or takeover scheme) for which a public announcement as contemplated by this Section 1.2(b) has been made, the
date upon which the Borrower (in the case of clause (i) above) or the person, group or entity (in the case of clause (ii) above)
consummates or publicly announces the termination or abandonment of the proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme)
which caused this Section 1.2(b) to become operative.  

  1.3.                
   Authorized Shares . The Borrower shall at all times have authorized, and reserved for
the purpose of issuance, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to provide for the full conversion or exercise of the outstanding
Note and issuance of the Conversion Shares in connection therewith (based on the Conversion Price of the Note in effect from time
to time) and as otherwise required by the Note. The Borrower shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon conversion of Note without the consent of the Buyer. The Borrower shall at all times maintain the number of shares
of Common Stock so reserved for issuance at an amount ( Reserved Amount ) equal to    three times   
the number that is then actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note and any additional Notes (based on the Conversion Price
of the Note in effect from time to time). If at any time the number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved for issuance
( Authorized and Reserved Shares ) is below the Reserved  

4   

Amount, the Company will promptly,
but in no event later than thirty days following a Share Reserve failure, take all corporate action necessary to authorize and
reserve a sufficient number of shares, including, without limitation, calling a special meeting of shareholders to authorize additional
shares to meet the Company s obligations under this Section 1.3, in the case of an insufficient number of authorized shares,
obtain shareholder approval of an increase in such authorized number of shares, and voting the management shares of the Borrower
in favor of an increase in the authorized shares of the Borrower to ensure that the number of authorized shares is sufficient to
meet the Reserved Amount. If the Borrower fails to obtain such shareholder approval within thirty (30) days following the date
on which the number of Reserved Amount exceeds the Authorized and Reserved Shares, it will be considered an Event of default under
the Note. In the event the Borrower fails to increase the Reserved Amount within sixty days of a Share Reserve failure and a Conversion
Notice has been submitted to the Borrower, Borrower shall be liable to pay the daily $2,000 cash penalty for failure to deliver
shares. Such penalty shall continue to accrue until such date as the Borrower increases the holders Share Reserve. The Borrower
(i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon
conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents
who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common
Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note. 

 If, at any
time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of the Note. 

  1.4.                
   Method of Conversion .  

  a)                   
   Mechanics of Conversion . Subject to Section 1.1, this Note may be converted by the
Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion
(by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York,
New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower.  

  b)                   
   Surrender of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender
this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall
maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In
the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall,  prima   facie,  be controlling
and determinative in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as
aforesaid, the Holder may not transfer this Note unless the Holder first physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon
the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder (upon
payment by the Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal
amount of this Note. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions
of this paragraph, following  

5   

conversion of a portion of this
Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note represented by this Note may be less than the amount stated on the
face hereof. 

  c)                   
   Payment of Taxes . The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable
in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion
of this Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver
any such shares or other securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian
in whose street name such shares are to be held for the Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid
to the Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been
paid.  

  d)                   
   Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the
Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the
requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered
to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days
after such receipt (the  Deadline ) (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof,
surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.  

  e)                   
   Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock . Upon receipt by the Borrower of a duly
and properly executed Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced
to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect
to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other
securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion
as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect
to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay
in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation
or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other
circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The
Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received
by the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time, on such date.  

  f)                    
   Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates
representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company
( DTC ) Fast Automated Securities Transfer ( FAST ) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance
with the provisions contained in Section 1.1 and in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer
agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock issuable upon conversion  

6   

to the Holder by crediting the
account of Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system. 

  g)                   
   Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting
the Holder s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if
delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline (including a failure due to
the circumstances described in Section 1.3 above)   the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $2,000 per day in cash, for each day
beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock through willful acts designed to hinder the delivery of
Common Stock to the Holder  . Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month
in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following
the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon
in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting
from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly
the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 1.4(g) are justified.  

  h)                   
   Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion .
In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if Borrower fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate
or certificates by the Deadline, and if and if after such Deadline the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in
an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder or Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common
Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon
the conversion relating to such Deadline (a  Buy-In ), then Borrower shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition
to any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase
price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale
price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B)
at the option of the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Note in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the
attempted conversion (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of
Common Stock that would have been issued if Borrower had timely complied with its delivery requirements. For example, if the Holder
purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of this
Note with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to
such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, Borrower shall be required
to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide Borrower written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect
of the Buy-In and, upon request of Borrower, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right
to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific
performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to Borrower s failure to timely deliver  

7   

certificates representing shares
of Common Stock upon conversion of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

  1.5.                
   Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this
Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act
or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form,
substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred
may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Act (or a successor rule) ( Rule 144 ) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an  affiliate 
(as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section
1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement
(and subject to the removal provisions set forth below), until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of this Note have been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the
number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement or that has not been sold pursuant
to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a legend substantially in
the following form, as appropriate:   

   NEITHER THE ISSUANCE
AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE
BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED
FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY
ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID
ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR
FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES .  

 The legend set forth above shall be
removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i) the Borrower
or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel form,    substance    and    scope    customary    for
opinions of counsel in    comparable transactions, to the effect that a    public
sale or    transfer of such Common Stock may 

8   

be made without registration under
the Act, which opinion shall be accepted by    the    Company    so    that    the    sale    or    transfer    is   
or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder
under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction
as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Company does not
accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration,
such as Rule 144 or Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note 

1.6.                
   Effect of Certain Events .   

  a)                   
   Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc . At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance
or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or
series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation,
merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower
is not the survivor shall either: (i) be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower
shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default
Amount (as defined in Article III) or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof.  Person  shall mean any individual,
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization.  

  b)                   
   Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc . If, at any time when this Note is issued
and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Notes, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization,
reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same
or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case
of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete
liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note,
upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore
issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction
had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set
forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder
of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion
Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable
in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction
described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, thirty (30) days prior written notice (but
in any event at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve,
or if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization
or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting
successor or acquiring entity (if  

9   

not the Borrower) assumes by
written instrument the obligations of this Section 1.6(b). The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations,
mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. 

  c)                   
   Adjustment Due to Distribution . If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution
of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of
capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the Borrower s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights
to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a  Distribution ), then the Holder of this
Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record for determining shareholders entitled to such
Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination
of shareholders entitled to such Distribution.  

  d)                   
   Adjustment Due to Dilutive Issuance.  If, at any time when the Note or any Conversion
Shares issuable upon conversion of the note, is issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues or sells, or in accordance with this
 Section 1.6(d)  hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock for no consideration or for a consideration
per share (before deduction of reasonable expenses or commissions or underwriting discounts or allowances in connection therewith)
less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such issuance (or deemed issuance) of such shares of Common Stock (a  Dilutive
Issuance ), then immediately upon the Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price will be reduced to the amount of the consideration
per share received by the Borrower in such Dilutive Issuance, but in no event shall the Conversion Price be above the original
Conversion Price.  

 The Borrower shall be deemed
to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or grants any warrants, rights or options (not
including employee stock option plans), whether or not immediately exercisable, to subscribe for or to purchase Common Stock or
other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock ( Convertible Securities ) (such warrants, rights
and options to purchase Common Stock or Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred to as  Options ) and the price
per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Conversion Price then in effect,
then the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. In the event Conversion Shares our outstanding and in the holder s
brokerage account, the Company shall issue an amount of additional shares such that the effective price shall equal the lower issuance
price. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise
of such Options  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration
for the issuance or granting of all such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable
to the Borrower upon the exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of
such Options, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time
such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of all such Options (assuming full conversion of Convertible Securities, if applicable). No further
adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such 

10   

Common Stock upon the exercise
of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Options. 

 Additionally, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities,
whether or not immediately convertible (other than where the same are issuable upon the exercise of Options), and the price per
share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then
the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share
for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any,
received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or sale of all such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Borrower upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time
such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will
be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

  e)                   
   Purchase Rights . If, at any time when any Notes are issued and outstanding, the Borrower
issues any convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (the  Purchase Rights )
pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock, then the Holder of this Note will be entitled to acquire, upon the
terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had
held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on
conversion contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase
Rights or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant,
issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.  

  f)                    
   Notice of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price as a result of the events described in this  Section 1.6 , the Borrower, at its expense, shall promptly compute
such adjustment or readjustment and prepare and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Borrower shall, upon the written request
at any time of the Holder, furnish to such Holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities
or property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Note.  

  1.7.                
   Trading Market Limitations . Unless permitted by the applicable rules and regulations
of the principal securities market on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded, in no event shall the Borrower issue upon
conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement more than the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock that the Borrower can issue pursuant to any rule of the principal United States securities market
on which the Common Stock is then traded (the  Maximum Share Amount ), which shall be 9.99% of the total shares outstanding
on the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), subject to equitable adjustment from time to time for stock splits,
stock  

11   

dividends, combinations, capital
reorganizations and similar events relating to the Common Stock occurring after the date hereof. Once the Maximum Share Amount
has been issued, if the Borrower fails to eliminate any prohibitions under applicable law or the rules or regulations of any stock
exchange, interdealer quotation system or other self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over the Borrower or any of its
securities on the Borrower s ability to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Maximum Share Amount, in lieu of any
further right to convert this Note, this will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.3 of the Note. 

  1.8.                
   Status as Shareholder . Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by a Holder, (i) the
shares covered thereby (other than the shares, if any, which cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Holder s
allocated portion of the Reserved Amount or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii)
the Holder s rights as a Holder of such converted portion of this Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right
to receive certificates for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in
equity to such Holder because of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a Holder has not received certificates for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the expiration
of the Deadline with respect to a conversion of any portion of this Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects
to retain its status as a holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder shall regain the rights of a Holder of
this Note with respect to such unconverted portions of this Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted
Note to the Holder or, if the Note has not been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note has not
been converted. In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right
to receive Conversion Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default and any
subsequent Conversion Default and (ii) the right to have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined
in accordance with Section 1.3) for the Borrower s failure to convert this Note.  

  1.9.                
   Prepayment . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note, at any
time during the period beginning on the Issue Date the Borrower shall have the right, exercisable on not less than three (3) Trading
Days prior written notice to the Holder of the Note to prepay the outstanding Note (principal and accrued interest), in full, in
accordance with this Section 1.9. Any notice of prepayment hereunder (an  Optional Prepayment Notice ) shall be delivered
to the Holder of the Note at its registered addresses and shall state: (1) that the Borrower is exercising its right to prepay
the Note, and (2) the date of prepayment which shall be not more than three (3) Trading Days from the date of the Optional Prepayment
Notice. On the date fixed for prepayment (the  Optional Prepayment Date ), the Borrower shall make payment of the Optional
Prepayment Amount (as defined below) to or upon the order of the Holder as specified by the Holder in writing to the Borrower at
least one (1) business day prior to the Optional Prepayment Date. If the Borrower exercises its right to prepay the Note, the Borrower
shall make payment to the Holder of an amount in cash (the  Optional Prepayment Amount ) equal to the Applicable Premium
(as defined below) multiplied by the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note  plus  (x) accrued
and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of this Note to the Optional Prepayment Date  plus  (y) Default
Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in clauses (w) and (x)  plus  (z) any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant
to Sections 1.2 and 1.4(g) hereof. If the Borrower delivers an Optional Prepayment Notice and fails to pay the  

12   

Optional Prepayment Amount due
to the Holder of the Note within two (2) business days following the Optional Prepayment Date, the Borrower shall forever forfeit
its right to prepay the Note pursuant to this Section 1.9. 

After the expiration of one hundred
eighty (180) following the date of the Note, the Borrower shall have no right of prepayment.

the continuation of any Event of Default specified in Section 3.1 (solely with respect to failure to pay the principal hereof or
interest thereon when due at the Maturity Date), the Note shall become immediately due and payable and the Borrower shall pay to
the Holder, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, an amount equal to the Default Sum (as defined herein). UPON THE

16   

shall become immediately due and
payable and the Borrower shall pay to the Holder, in full satisfaction of its obligations hereunder, an amount equal to the greater
of (i) 150%  times  the  sum  of (w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note  plus  (x)
accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal amount of this Note to the date of payment (the  Mandatory Prepayment
Date )  plus  (y) Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in clauses (w) and/or (x)  plus  (z)
any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof (the then outstanding principal amount of this Note to
the date of payment  plus  the amounts referred to in clauses (x), (y) and (z) shall collectively be known as the
 Default Sum ) or (ii) the  parity value  of the Default Sum to be prepaid, where parity value means (a)
the highest number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to such Default Sum in accordance
with Article I, treating the Trading Day immediately preceding the Mandatory Prepayment Date as the  Conversion Date 
for purposes of determining the lowest applicable Conversion Price, unless the Default Event arises as a result of a breach in
respect of a specific Conversion Date in which case such Conversion Date shall be the Conversion Date),  multiplied by  (b)
the highest Closing Price for the Common Stock during the period beginning on the date of first occurrence of the Event of Default
and ending one day prior to the Mandatory Prepayment Date (the  Default Amount ) and all other amounts payable hereunder
shall immediately become due and payable, all without demand, presentment or notice, all of which hereby are expressly waived,
together with all costs, including, without limitation, legal fees and expenses, of collection, and the Holder shall be entitled
to exercise all other rights and remedies available at law or in equity. 

 If the Borrower fails to pay the
Default Amount within five (5) business days of written notice that such amount is due and payable, then the Holder shall have
the right at any time, so long as the Borrower remains in default (and so long and to the extent that there are sufficient authorized
shares), to require the Borrower, upon written notice, to immediately issue, in lieu of the Default Amount, the number of shares
of Common Stock of the Borrower equal to the Default Amount divided by the Conversion Price which shall be so that the Variable
Conversion Price equals 40% (discount of 60%)

  4.1.                
   Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver . No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in
the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privileges. All
rights and remedies existing hereunder are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

  4.3.                
   Amendments . This Note and any provision hereof may only be amended by an instrument
in writing signed by the Borrower and the Holder. The term  Note  and all reference thereto, as used throughout this
instrument, shall mean this instrument (and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) as originally executed,
or if later amended or supplemented, then as so amended or supplemented.  

  4.4.                
   Assignability . This Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and
assigns, and shall inure to be the benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns. Each transferee of this Note must be an
 accredited investor  (as defined in Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Act). Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the contrary,

   Cost of Collection . If default is made in the payment of this Note, the Borrower shall

  4.6.                
   Governing Law .  This Note shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws principles that would
result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction.  Any action brought by either party against
the other concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement must be brought only in the civil or state courts of
California or in the federal courts located in Los Angeles County.  Both parties and the individual signing this Agreement
on behalf of the Borrower agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.  The prevailing party shall be entitled
to recover from the other party its reasonable attorney s fees and costs.  In the event that any provision of this
Note is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to
the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision
which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or unenforceability of any other provision
of this Note. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or operate to preclude the Holder from bringing suit or taking other legal
action against the Borrower in any other jurisdiction to collect on the Borrower s obligations to Holder, to realize on any
collateral or any other security for such obligations, or to enforce a judgment or other decision in favor of the Holder.   This
Note shall be deemed an unconditional obligation of Borrower for the payment of money and, without limitation to any other remedies
of Holder, may be enforced against Borrower by summary proceeding pursuant to any rule or statute in the jurisdiction where enforcement
is sought.  For purposes of such rule or statute, any other document or agreement to which Holder and Borrower are parties
or which Borrower delivered to Holder, which may be convenient or necessary to determine Holder s rights hereunder or Borrower s
obligations to Holder are deemed a part of this Note, whether or not such other document or agreement was delivered together herewith
or was executed apart from this Note.    

18   

4.7.                
   Certain Amounts . Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is required to pay an
amount in excess of the outstanding principal amount (or the portion thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and
unpaid interest plus Default Interest on such interest, the Borrower and the Holder agree that the actual damages to the Holder
from the receipt of cash payment on this Note may be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower represents
stipulated damages and not a penalty and is intended to compensate the Holder in part for loss of the opportunity to convert this
Note and to earn a return from the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of this Note at a price in excess of
the price paid for such shares pursuant to this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree that such amount of stipulated damages
is not plainly disproportionate to the possible loss to the Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to
convert this Note into shares of Common Stock.  

  4.8.                
   Disclosure . Upon receipt or delivery by the Company of any
notice in accordance with the terms of this Note, unless the Company has in good faith determined that the matters relating to
such notice do not constitute material, non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company
shall within one (1) Trading Day after any such receipt or delivery, publicly disclose such material, non-public information on
a Current Report on Form 8-K or otherwise. In the event that the Company believes that a notice contains material, non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company so shall indicate to such Holder contemporaneously with delivery
of such notice, and in the absence of any such indication, the Holder shall be allowed to presume that all matters relating to
such notice do not constitute material, non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries.  

  4.9.                
   Purchase Agreement . By its acceptance of this Note, each party agrees to be bound by
the applicable terms of the Purchase Agreement.  

  4.10.            
   Notice of Corporate Events . Except as otherwise provided below, the Holder of this
Note shall have no rights as a Holder of Common Stock unless and only to the extent that it converts this Note into Common Stock.
The Borrower shall provide the Holder with prior notification of any meeting of the Borrower s shareholders (and copies of
proxy materials and other information sent to shareholders). In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of its shareholders
for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, any right
to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, reclassification or recapitalization)
any share of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or for the purpose of determining shareholders
who are entitled to vote in connection with any proposed sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Borrower or any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Borrower, the Borrower shall mail a notice to the Holder,
at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date specified therein (or thirty (30) days prior to the consummation of the transaction
or event, whichever is earlier), of the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution,
right or other event, and a brief statement regarding the amount and character of such dividend, distribution, right or other event
to the extent known at such time. The Borrower shall make a public announcement of any event requiring notification to the Holder
hereunder substantially simultaneously with the notification to the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.9.  

19   

4.11.            
   Remedies . The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder
will cause irreparable harm to the Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly,
the Borrower acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees,
in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder shall be entitled,
in addition to all other available remedies at law or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction
or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof,
without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.  

  4.12.            
  Unconditional Obligation; No Offset.   Borrower
acknowledges that this Note is an unconditional, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Borrower not subject to offset, deduction
or counterclaim of any kind. Borrower hereby waives any rights of offset it now has or may have hereafter against Lender, its successors
and assigns, and agrees to make the payments or conversions called for herein in accordance with the terms of this Note.  

  4.13.            
   Severability . If any provision of this Note is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
balance of this Note shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless
remain applicable to all other persons and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest
due hereunder shall violate applicable laws governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically
be lowered to equal the maximum permitted rate of interest. The Borrower covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that
it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension
or usury law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Borrower from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest
on this Note as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this indenture, and the Borrower (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefits
or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impeded the execution
of any power herein granted to the  
 
       20   

Holder, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such as though no such law has been
enacted  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Borrower
has caused this Note to be signed in its name by its duly authorized officer this day of  August 16, 2016

and to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance hereof at the rate of twelve (12%) (the  Interest Rate ) per annum

All payments shall be made at such address as the Holder shall hereafter give to the Borrower by written notice made in accordance
with the provisions of this Note. Whenever any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is
not a business day, the same shall instead be due on the next succeeding day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest

 This Note
is free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive
rights or other similar rights of shareholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof. 

 The following
terms shall apply to this Note: 

  ARTICLE
I.  CONVERSION RIGHTS 

  1.1.                
   Conversion Right . The Holder shall have the right from time to time, and at any time
during the period beginning on the date which is one hundred eighty one (181) days following the date of this Note and ending on
the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined in Article III) pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) or Article III, each in respect of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this Note to convert all or any
part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note into fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock, as
such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such
Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) determined
as provided herein (a  Conversion );  provided ,  however , that in no event shall the Holder be
entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the
number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may
be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion
of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained
herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which
the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more
than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso The number of shares
of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined
below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the  Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section
1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably
expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the  Conversion
Date ). The term  Conversion Amount  means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal
amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion  plus  (2) at the Holder s option, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date,  plus  (3)
at the Holder s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or
(2)  plus  (4) at the Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g)
hereof.  

2   

1.2.                
   Conversion Price .  

a)                   
   Calculation of Conversion Price . The conversion price (the  Conversion Price )
shall equal the lesser of $0.40 or the Variable Conversion Price (as defined herein) (subject to equitable adjustments for stock
splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any
subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). The
 Variable Conversion Price  shall mean 56% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount
rate of 44%).  Market Price  means the lowest Trading Price (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the
twenty (20) Trading Day period ending on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date.  Trading Price 
means, for any security as of any date, the closing bid price on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or applicable trading market
(the  OTCQB ) as reported by a reliable reporting service ( Reporting Service ) designated by the Holder
(i.e. Bloomberg) or, if the OTCQB is not the principal trading market for such security, the closing bid price of such security
on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such security is listed or traded or, if no closing bid price of such
security is available in any of the foregoing manners, the average of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security
that are listed in the  pink sheets  by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. If the Trading Price cannot be calculated
for such security on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined
by the Borrower and the holders of a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading
Price is required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes.   Provided ,  however   ,  that
if the closing bid price for the common stock on the Clearing Date (defined below) is lower than the Closing Bid Price, then the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted such that the discount rate shall be taken from the closing bid price on the Clearing Date,
and the Company shall issue additional shares to the Holder to reflect such adjusted Conversion Price; and provided further, that
if the Company s common stock becomes chilled by Deposit Trust Corporation (DTC) at the time that any portion of the principal
and interest of this Note is converted by Holder, then the Variable Conversion Price shall be forty percent (representing a discount
of 60%) for so long as the Common Stock is chilled. For purposes of this Agreement, the Clearing Date shall be on the date in which
the Conversion Shares are deposited into the Holder s brokerage account and Holder s broker has confirmed with Holder
that the Holder may execute trades of the Conversion Shares without restriction. If such notice is received from the broker by
the Holder after 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, the notice shall be deemed to have been received on the next Trading Day.  Trading
Day  shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the OTCQB, or on the principal securities
exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded.   The Company shall be responsible for
the full cost and expense in connection with the issuance and delivery (expedited) of shares to the Borrower holder, including,
but not limited to the cost and issuance fees that may be charged by the Company s transfer agent to the holder upon each
Conversion Notice. In the event the transfer agent assess a cash charge to the Borrower upon any conversion, the Borrower may at
its election deduct the entire cost from the principal amount being converted.     

  b)                   
   Holder s Right of Alternative Conversion Price . If the Company in any manner
issues or sells or enters into any agreement to issue or sell, any Common Stock or Convertible Securities (any such securities,
 Variable Price Securities ) after the Closing Date that are issuable pursuant to such agreement or convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for  

3   

shares of Common Stock pursuant
to such Options or Convertible Securities, as applicable, at a price which varies or may vary with the market price of the shares
of Common Stock, including by way of one or more reset(s) to a fixed price, but exclusive of such formulations reflecting customary
anti-dilution provisions (such as share splits, share combinations, share dividends and similar transactions) (each of the formulations
for such variable price being herein referred to as, the  Other Variable Price ), and the Other Variable Price is lower
than the Variable Conversion Price then in effect under this Note, the Company shall provide written notice thereof via facsimile
and overnight courier to the Holder on the date of such agreement and/or the issuance of such Convertible Securities or Options,
as applicable. From and after the date the Company enters into such agreement or issues any such Variable Price Securities, the
Holder shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion to substitute the Other Variable Price for the Conversion
Price upon conversion of this Note by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered upon any conversion of this Note that solely
for purposes of such conversion the Holder is relying on the Other Variable Price rather than the Conversion Price then in effect.
The Holder s election to rely on the Other Variable Price for a particular conversion of this Note shall not obligate the
Holder to rely on the Other Variable Price for any future conversion of this Note. 

  c)                   
   Conversion Price During Major Announcements . Notwithstanding anything contained in
Section 1.2(a) to the contrary, in the event the Borrower (i) makes a public announcement that it intends to consolidate or merge
with any other corporation (other than a merger in which the Borrower is the surviving or continuing corporation and its capital
stock is unchanged) or sell or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or (ii) any person, group or entity
(including the Borrower) publicly announces a tender offer to purchase 50% or more of the Borrower s Common Stock (or any
other takeover scheme) (the date of the announcement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) is hereinafter referred to as the  Announcement
Date ), then the Conversion Price shall, effective upon the Announcement Date and continuing through the Adjusted Conversion
Price Termination Date (as defined below), be equal to the lower of (x) the Conversion Price which would have been applicable for
a Conversion occurring on the Announcement Date and (y) the Conversion Price that would otherwise be in effect. From and after
the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date, the Conversion Price shall be determined as set forth in this Section 1.2(a). For
purposes hereof,  Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date  shall mean, with respect to any proposed transaction
or tender offer (or takeover scheme) for which a public announcement as contemplated by this Section 1.2(b) has been made, the
date upon which the Borrower (in the case of clause (i) above) or the person, group or entity (in the case of clause (ii) above)
consummates or publicly announces the termination or abandonment of the proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme)
which caused this Section 1.2(b) to become operative.  

  1.3.                
   Authorized Shares . The Borrower shall at all times have authorized, and reserved for
the purpose of issuance, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to provide for the full conversion or exercise of the outstanding
Note and issuance of the Conversion Shares in connection therewith (based on the Conversion Price of the Note in effect from time
to time) and as otherwise required by the Note. The Borrower shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon conversion of Note without the consent of the Buyer. The Borrower shall at all times maintain the number of shares
of Common Stock so reserved for issuance at an amount ( Reserved Amount ) equal to    three times   
the number that is then actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note and any additional Notes (based on the Conversion Price  

4   

of the Note in effect from time
to time). If at any time the number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved for issuance ( Authorized and Reserved
Shares ) is below the Reserved Amount, the Company will promptly, but in no event later than thirty days following a Share
Reserve failure, take all corporate action necessary to authorize and reserve a sufficient number of shares, including, without
limitation, calling a special meeting of shareholders to authorize additional shares to meet the Company s obligations under
this Section 1.3, in the case of an insufficient number of authorized shares, obtain shareholder approval of an increase in such
authorized number of shares, and voting the management shares of the Borrower in favor of an increase in the authorized shares
of the Borrower to ensure that the number of authorized shares is sufficient to meet the Reserved Amount. If the Borrower fails
to obtain such shareholder approval within thirty (30) days following the date on which the number of Reserved Amount exceeds the
Authorized and Reserved Shares, it will be considered an Event of default under the Note. In the event the Borrower fails to increase
the Reserved Amount within sixty days of a Share Reserve failure and a Conversion Notice has been submitted to the Borrower, Borrower
shall be liable to pay the daily $2,000 cash penalty for failure to deliver shares. Such penalty shall continue to accrue until
such date as the Borrower increases the holders Share Reserve. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed
its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance
of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates
to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Note. 

 If, at any
time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of the Note. 

  1.4.                
   Method of Conversion .  

  a)                   
   Mechanics of Conversion . Subject to Section 1.1, this Note may be converted by the
Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion
(by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York,
New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower.  

  b)                   
   Surrender of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender
this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall
maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In
the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall,  prima   facie,  be controlling
and determinative in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as
aforesaid, the Holder may not transfer this Note unless the Holder first physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon
the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder (upon
payment by the Holder of any applicable transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the  

5   

remaining unpaid principal amount
of this Note. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions
of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note represented
by this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof. 

  c)                   
   Payment of Taxes . The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable
in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion
of this Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver
any such shares or other securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian
in whose street name such shares are to be held for the Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid
to the Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been
paid.  

  d)                   
   Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the
Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the
requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered
to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days
after such receipt (the  Deadline ) (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof,
surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.  

  e)                   
   Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock . Upon receipt by the Borrower of a duly
and properly executed Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced
to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect
to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other
securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion
as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect
to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay
in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation
or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other
circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The
Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received
by the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time, on such date.  

  f)                    
   Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates
representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company
( DTC ) Fast Automated Securities Transfer ( FAST ) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance
with the  

6   

provisions contained in Section
1.1 and in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the
Common Stock issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its
Deposit Withdrawal Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system. 

  g)                   
   Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting
the Holder s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if
delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline (including a failure due to
the circumstances described in Section 1.3 above)   the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $2,000 per day in cash, for each day
beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock through willful acts designed to hinder the delivery of
Common Stock to the Holder  . Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month
in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following
the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon
in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting
from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly
the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 1.4(g) are justified.  

  h)                   
   Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion .
In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if Borrower fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate
or certificates by the Deadline, and if and if after such Deadline the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in
an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder or Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common
Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon
the conversion relating to such Deadline (a  Buy-In ), then Borrower shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition
to any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase
price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale
price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B)
at the option of the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Note in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the
attempted conversion (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of
Common Stock that would have been issued if Borrower had timely complied with its delivery requirements. For example, if the Holder
purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of this
Note with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to
such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, Borrower shall be required
to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide Borrower written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect
of the Buy-In and, upon request of Borrower, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right
to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of  

7   

specific performance and/or injunctive
relief with respect to Borrower s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon conversion
of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

  1.5.                
   Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this
Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act
or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form,
substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred
may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Act (or a successor rule) ( Rule 144 ) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an  affiliate 
(as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section
1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement
(and subject to the removal provisions set forth below), until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of this Note have been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the
number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement or that has not been sold pursuant
to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a legend substantially in
the following form, as appropriate:   

   NEITHER THE ISSUANCE
AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE
BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED
FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY
ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID
ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR
FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES .  

 The legend set forth above shall be
removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i) the Borrower
or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel form,    substance    and    scope    customary    for
opinions of counsel 

8   

in    comparable
transactions, to the effect that a    public sale or    transfer
of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the Act, which opinion shall be accepted by    the    Company    so    that    the    sale    or    transfer    is   
or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder
under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction
as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Company does not
accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration,
such as Rule 144 or Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note 

1.6.                
   Effect of Certain Events .   

  a)                   
   Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc . At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance
or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or
series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation,
merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower
is not the survivor shall either: (i) be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower
shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default
Amount (as defined in Article III) or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof.  Person  shall mean any individual,
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization.  

  b)                   
   Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc . If, at any time when this Note is issued
and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Notes, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization,
reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same
or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case
of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete
liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note,
upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore
issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction
had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set
forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder
of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion
Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable
in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction
described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, thirty (30) days prior written notice (but
in any event at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve,
or if there is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization
or other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the  

9   

Holder shall be entitled to convert
this Note) and (b) the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations
of this Section 1.6(b). The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share
exchanges. 

  c)                   
   Adjustment Due to Distribution . If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution
of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of
capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the Borrower s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights
to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a  Distribution ), then the Holder of this
Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record for determining shareholders entitled to such
Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination
of shareholders entitled to such Distribution.  

  d)                   
   Adjustment Due to Dilutive Issuance.  If, at any time when the Note or any Conversion
Shares issuable upon conversion of the note, is issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues or sells, or in accordance with this
 Section 1.6(d)  hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock for no consideration or for a consideration
per share (before deduction of reasonable expenses or commissions or underwriting discounts or allowances in connection therewith)
less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such issuance (or deemed issuance) of such shares of Common Stock (a  Dilutive
Issuance ), then immediately upon the Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price will be reduced to the amount of the consideration
per share received by the Borrower in such Dilutive Issuance, but in no event shall the Conversion Price be above the original
Conversion Price.  

 The Borrower shall be deemed
to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or grants any warrants, rights or options (not
including employee stock option plans), whether or not immediately exercisable, to subscribe for or to purchase Common Stock or
other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock ( Convertible Securities ) (such warrants, rights
and options to purchase Common Stock or Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred to as  Options ) and the price
per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Conversion Price then in effect,
then the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. In the event Conversion Shares our outstanding and in the holder s
brokerage account, the Company shall issue an amount of additional shares such that the effective price shall equal the lower issuance
price. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise
of such Options  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration
for the issuance or granting of all such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable
to the Borrower upon the exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of
such Options, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time
such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise of all such Options (assuming full conversion of Convertible Securities, if applicable). No further
adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such 

10   

Common Stock upon the exercise
of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of such Options. 

 Additionally, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities,
whether or not immediately convertible (other than where the same are issuable upon the exercise of Options), and the price per
share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then
the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share
for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any,
received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or sale of all such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Borrower upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time
such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will
be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

  e)                   
   Purchase Rights . If, at any time when any Notes are issued and outstanding, the Borrower
issues any convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (the  Purchase Rights )
pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock, then the Holder of this Note will be entitled to acquire, upon the
terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had
held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on
conversion contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase
Rights or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant,
issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.  

  f)                    
   Notice of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price as a result of the events described in this  Section 1.6 , the Borrower, at its expense, shall promptly compute
such adjustment or readjustment and prepare and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Borrower shall, upon the written request
at any time of the Holder, furnish to such Holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities
or property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Note.  

  1.7.                
   Trading Market Limitations . Unless permitted by the applicable rules and regulations
of the principal securities market on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded, in no event shall the Borrower issue upon
conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement more than the maximum
number of shares of Common Stock that the Borrower can issue pursuant to any rule of the principal United States securities market
on which the Common Stock is then traded (the  Maximum Share Amount ), which shall be 9.99% of the total shares outstanding
on the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), subject to equitable adjustment from time to time for stock splits,
stock  

11   

dividends, combinations, capital
reorganizations and similar events relating to the Common Stock occurring after the date hereof. Once the Maximum Share Amount
has been issued, if the Borrower fails to eliminate any prohibitions under applicable law or the rules or regulations of any stock
exchange, interdealer quotation system or other self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over the Borrower or any of its
securities on the Borrower s ability to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Maximum Share Amount, in lieu of any
further right to convert this Note, this will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.3 of the Note. 

  1.8.                
   Status as Shareholder . Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by a Holder, (i) the
shares covered thereby (other than the shares, if any, which cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Holder s
allocated portion of the Reserved Amount or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii)
the Holder s rights as a Holder of such converted portion of this Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right
to receive certificates for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in
equity to such Holder because of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a Holder has not received certificates for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the expiration
of the Deadline with respect to a conversion of any portion of this Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects
to retain its status as a holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder shall regain the rights of a Holder of
this Note with respect to such unconverted portions of this Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted
Note to the Holder or, if the Note has not been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note has not
been converted. In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right
to receive Conversion Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default and any
subsequent Conversion Default and (ii) the right to have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined
in accordance with Section 1.3) for the Borrower s failure to convert this Note.  

ARTICLE
II.  CERTAIN COVENANTS 

  2.1.                
   Restriction on Stock Repurchases . So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation
under this Note, the Borrower shall not without the Holder s written consent redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (whether
for cash or in exchange for property or other securities or otherwise) in any one transaction or series of related transactions
any shares of capital stock of the Borrower or any warrants, rights or options to purchase or acquire any such shares.  

  2.2.                
   Sale of Assets . So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation under this Note,
the Borrower shall not, without the Holder s written consent, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of any significant portion
of its assets outside the ordinary course of business. Any consent to the disposition of any assets may be conditioned on a specified
use of the proceeds of disposition.     

  2.3.                
   Prohibition on Equity Line of Credit . Without prior written approval from Holder, from
the date hereof until the Note is no longer outstanding, the Company will not, without the consent of the Holder, enter into any
Equity Line of Credit or similar agreement, nor exercise  

12   

of any of its rights under any
Equity Line of Credit entered into as of the Closing Date other than an Equity Line of Credit entered into with the Borrower or
its affiliates, (an  Equity Line of Credit ). For purposes hereof,  Equity Line of Credit  shall include
any transaction involving a written agreement between the Company and an investor or underwriter whereby the Company has the right
to  put  its securities to the investor or underwriter over an agreed period of time and at an agreed price or price
formula, whether entered into prior to or after the Closing Date. 

  ARTICLE
III.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT 

  If any
of the following events of default (each, an  Event of Default ) shall occur: 

  3.1.                
   Failure to Pay Principal or Interest . The Borrower fails to pay the principal
hereof or interest thereon when due on this Note, whether at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise.  

  3.2.                
   Conversion and the Shares . The Borrower fails to issue shares of Common Stock
to the Holder (or announces or threatens in writing that it will not honor its obligation to do so) upon exercise by the Holder
of the conversion rights of the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Note, fails to transfer or cause its transfer
agent to transfer (issue) (electronically or in certificated form) any certificate for shares of Common Stock issued to the Holder
upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note as and when required by this Note, the Borrower directs its transfer agent
not to transfer or delays, impairs, and/or hinders its transfer agent in transferring (or issuing) (electronically or in certificated
form) any certificate for shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Holder upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note
as and when required by this Note, or fails to remove (or directs its transfer agent not to remove or impairs, delays, and/or hinders
its transfer agent from removing) any restrictive legend (or to withdraw any stop transfer instructions in respect thereof) on
any certificate for any shares of Common Stock issued to the Holder upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note as and
when required by this Note (or makes any written announcement, statement or threat that it does not intend to honor the obligations
described in this paragraph) and any such failure shall continue uncured (or any written announcement, statement or threat not
to honor its obligations shall not be rescinded in writing) for three (3) business days after the Holder shall have delivered a

shares), to require the Borrower, upon written notice, to immediately issue, in lieu of the Default Amount, the number of shares
of Common Stock of the Borrower equal to the Default Amount divided by the Conversion Price which shall be so that the Variable

rights and remedies existing hereunder are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

  4.3.                
   Amendments . This Note and any provision hereof may only be amended by an instrument
in writing signed by the Borrower and the Holder. The term  Note  and all reference thereto, as used throughout this
instrument, shall mean this instrument (and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) as originally executed,
or if later amended or supplemented, then as so amended or supplemented.  

  4.4.                
   Assignability . This Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and
assigns, and shall inure to be the benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns. Each transferee of this Note must be an
 accredited investor  (as defined in Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Act). Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the contrary,

   Cost of Collection . If default is made in the payment of this Note, the Borrower shall
pay the Holder hereof costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys  fees.  

  4.6.                
   Governing Law .  This Note shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Nevada without regard to conflicts of laws principles that would result
in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction.  Any action brought by either party against the other
concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement must be brought only in the civil or state courts of Nevada or
in the federal courts located in Las Vegas.  Both parties and the individual signing this Agreement on behalf of the
Borrower agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.  The prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from
the other party its reasonable attorney s fees and costs.  In the event that any provision of this Note is invalid
or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that
it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision which may
prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or unenforceability of any other provision of this Note.
Nothing contained herein shall be deemed or operate to preclude the Holder from bringing suit or taking other legal action against
the Borrower in any other jurisdiction to collect on the Borrower s obligations to Holder, to realize on any collateral or
any other security for such obligations, or to enforce a judgment or other decision in favor of the Holder.   This
Note shall be deemed an unconditional obligation of Borrower for the payment of money and, without    

17   

limitation
to any other remedies of Holder, may be enforced against Borrower by summary proceeding pursuant to any rule or statute in the
jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.  For purposes of such rule or statute, any other document or agreement to which
Holder and Borrower are parties or which Borrower delivered to Holder, which may be convenient or necessary to determine Holder s
rights hereunder or Borrower s obligations to Holder are deemed a part of this Note, whether or not such other document or
agreement was delivered together herewith or was executed apart from this Note.   

  4.7.                
   Certain Amounts . Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is required to pay an
amount in excess of the outstanding principal amount (or the portion thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and
unpaid interest plus Default Interest on such interest, the Borrower and the Holder agree that the actual damages to the Holder
from the receipt of cash payment on this Note may be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower represents
stipulated damages and not a penalty and is intended to compensate the Holder in part for loss of the opportunity to convert this
Note and to earn a return from the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of this Note at a price in excess of
the price paid for such shares pursuant to this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree that such amount of stipulated damages
is not plainly disproportionate to the possible loss to the Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to
convert this Note into shares of Common Stock.  

  4.8.                
   Disclosure . Upon receipt or delivery by the Company of any
notice in accordance with the terms of this Note, unless the Company has in good faith determined that the matters relating to
such notice do not constitute material, non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company
shall within one (1) Trading Day after any such receipt or delivery, publicly disclose such material, non-public information on
a Current Report on Form 8-K or otherwise. In the event that the Company believes that a notice contains material, non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company so shall indicate to such Holder contemporaneously with delivery
of such notice, and in the absence of any such indication, the Holder shall be allowed to presume that all matters relating to
such notice do not constitute material, non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries.  

  4.9.                
   Purchase Agreement . By its acceptance of this Note, each party agrees to be bound by
the applicable terms of the Purchase Agreement.  

  4.10.            
   Notice of Corporate Events . Except as otherwise provided below, the Holder of this
Note shall have no rights as a Holder of Common Stock unless and only to the extent that it converts this Note into Common Stock.
The Borrower shall provide the Holder with prior notification of any meeting of the Borrower s shareholders (and copies of
proxy materials and other information sent to shareholders). In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of its shareholders
for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, any right
to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, reclassification or recapitalization)
any share of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or for the purpose of determining shareholders
who are entitled to vote in connection with any proposed sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Borrower or any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Borrower, the Borrower shall mail a notice to the Holder,
at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date specified therein (or thirty (30) days prior to the  

18   

consummation of the transaction
or event, whichever is earlier), of the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution,
right or other event, and a brief statement regarding the amount and character of such dividend, distribution, right or other event
to the extent known at such time. The Borrower shall make a public announcement of any event requiring notification to the Holder
hereunder substantially simultaneously with the notification to the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Section 4.9. 

  4.11.            
   Remedies . The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder
will cause irreparable harm to the Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly,
the Borrower acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees,
in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder shall be entitled,
in addition to all other available remedies at law or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction
or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof,
without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.  

  4.12.            
  Unconditional Obligation; No Offset.   Borrower
acknowledges that this Note is an unconditional, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Borrower not subject to offset, deduction
or counterclaim of any kind. Borrower hereby waives any rights of offset it now has or may have hereafter against Lender, its successors
and assigns, and agrees to make the payments or conversions called for herein in accordance with the terms of this Note.  

  4.13.            
   Severability . If any provision of this Note is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
balance of this Note shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless
remain applicable to all other persons and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest
due hereunder shall violate applicable laws governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically
be lowered to equal the maximum permitted rate of interest. The Borrower covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that
it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension
or usury law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Borrower from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest
on this Note as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this indenture, and the Borrower (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefits
or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impeded the execution
of any power herein granted to the Holder, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such as though no such law has been
enacted  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Borrower
has caused this Note to be signed in its name by its duly authorized officer this 7 th  day of September, 2016.

herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which
the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more
than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange

amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion  plus  (2) at the Holder s option, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date,  plus  (3)
at the Holder s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or
(2)  plus  (4) at the Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g)
hereof.  

  1.2.                
   Conversion Price .  

2   

a)                   
   Calculation of Conversion Price . The conversion price (the  Conversion Price )
shall equal the lesser of $0.20 or the Variable Conversion Price (as defined herein) (subject to equitable adjustments for stock
splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any
subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). The
 Variable Conversion Price  shall mean 50% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount
rate of 50%).  Market Price  means the lowest Trading Price (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the
twenty (20) Trading Day period ending on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date.  Trading Price 
means, for any security as of any date, the closing bid price on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or applicable trading market
(the  OTCQB ) as reported by a reliable reporting service ( Reporting Service ) designated by the Holder
(i.e. Bloomberg) or, if the OTCQB is not the principal trading market for such security, the closing bid price of such security
on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such security is listed or traded or, if no closing bid price of such
security is available in any of the foregoing manners, the average of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security
that are listed in the  pink sheets  by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. If the Trading Price cannot be calculated
for such security on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined
by the Borrower and the holders of a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading
Price is required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes.   Provided ,  however   ,  that
if the closing bid price for the common stock on the Clearing Date (defined below) is lower than the Closing Bid Price, then the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted such that the discount rate shall be taken from the closing bid price on the Clearing Date,
and the Company shall issue additional shares to the Holder to reflect such adjusted Conversion Price; and provided further, that
if the Company s common stock becomes chilled by Deposit Trust Corporation (DTC) at the time that any portion of the principal
and interest of this Note is converted by Holder, than the Variable Conversion Price shall be forty percent (representing a discount
of 60%) for so long as the Common Stock is chilled. For purposes of this Agreement, the Clearing Date shall be on the date in which
the Conversion Shares are deposited into the Holder s brokerage account and Holder s broker has confirmed with Holder
that the Holder may execute trades of the Conversion Shares without restriction. If such notice is received from the broker by
the Holder after 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, the notice shall be deemed to have been received on the next Trading Day.  Trading
Day  shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the OTCQB, or on the principal securities
exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded.   The Company shall be responsible for
the full cost and expense in connection with the issuance and delivery (expedited) of shares to the Borrower holder, including,
but not limited to the cost and issuance fees that may be charged by the Company s transfer agent to the holder upon each
Conversion Notice. In the event the transfer agent assess a cash charge to the Borrower upon any conversion, the Borrower may at
its election deduct the entire cost from the principal amount being converted.     

  b)                   
   Holder s Right of Alternative Conversion Price . If the Company in any manner
issues or sells or enters into any agreement to issue or sell, any Common Stock or Convertible Securities (any such securities,
 Variable Price Securities ) after the Closing Date that are issuable pursuant to such agreement or convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Options or Convertible Securities, as applicable, at  

3   

a price which varies or may vary
with the market price of the shares of Common Stock, including by way of one or more reset(s) to a fixed price, but exclusive of
such formulations reflecting customary anti-dilution provisions (such as share splits, share combinations, share dividends and
similar transactions) (each of the formulations for such variable price being herein referred to as, the  Other Variable
Price ), and the Other Variable Price is greater than the Variable Conversion Price then in effect under this Note, the Company
shall provide written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Buyer on the date of such agreement and/or the
issuance of such Convertible Securities or Options, as applicable. From and after the date the Company enters into such agreement
or issues any such Variable Price Securities, the Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion to
substitute the Other Variable Price for the Conversion Price upon conversion of this Note by designating in the Conversion Notice
delivered upon any conversion of this Note that solely for purposes of such conversion the Buyer is relying on the Other Variable
Price rather than the Conversion Price then in effect. The Buyer s election to rely on the Other Variable Price for a particular
conversion of this Note shall not obligate the Holder to rely on the Other Variable Price for any future conversion of this Note. 

  c)                   
   Conversion Price During Major Announcements . Notwithstanding anything contained in
Section 1.2(a) to the contrary, in the event the Borrower (i) makes a public announcement that it intends to consolidate or merge
with any other corporation (other than a merger in which the Borrower is the surviving or continuing corporation and its capital
stock is unchanged) or sell or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or (ii) any person, group or entity
(including the Borrower) publicly announces a tender offer to purchase 50% or more of the Borrower s Common Stock (or any
other takeover scheme) (the date of the announcement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) is hereinafter referred to as the  Announcement
Date ), then the Conversion Price shall, effective upon the Announcement Date and continuing through the Adjusted Conversion
Price Termination Date (as defined below), be equal to the lower of (x) the Conversion Price which would have been applicable for
a Conversion occurring on the Announcement Date and (y) the Conversion Price that would otherwise be in effect. From and after
the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date, the Conversion Price shall be determined as set forth in this Section 1.2(a). For
purposes hereof,  Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date  shall mean, with respect to any proposed transaction
or tender offer (or takeover scheme) for which a public announcement as contemplated by this Section 1.2(b) has been made, the
date upon which the Borrower (in the case of clause (i) above) or the person, group or entity (in the case of clause (ii) above)
consummates or publicly announces the termination or abandonment of the proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme)
which caused this Section 1.2(b) to become operative.  

  1.3.                
   Authorized Shares . The Borrower shall at all times have authorized, and reserved for
the purpose of issuance, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to provide for the full conversion or exercise of the outstanding
Note and issuance of the Conversion Shares in connection therewith (based on the Conversion Price of the Note in effect from time
to time) and as otherwise required by the Note. The Borrower shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon conversion of Note without the consent of the Buyer. The Borrower shall at all times maintain the number of shares
of Common Stock so reserved for issuance at an amount ( Reserved Amount ) equal to    three times   
the number that is then actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note and any additional Notes (based on the Conversion  

4   

Price of the Note in effect from
time to time). If at any time the number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved for issuance ( Authorized and
Reserved Shares ) is below the Reserved Amount, the Company will promptly, but in no event later than thirty days following
a Share Reserve failure, take all corporate action necessary to authorize and reserve a sufficient number of shares, including,
without limitation, calling a special meeting of shareholders to authorize additional shares to meet the Company s obligations
under this Section 1.3, in the case of an insufficient number of authorized shares, obtain shareholder approval of an increase
in such authorized number of shares, and voting the management shares of the Borrower in favor of an increase in the authorized
shares of the Borrower to ensure that the number of authorized shares is sufficient to meet the Reserved Amount. If the Borrower
fails to obtain such shareholder approval within thirty (30) days following the date on which the number of Reserved Amount exceeds
the Authorized and Reserved Shares, it will be considered an Event of default under the Note. In the event the Borrower fails to
increase the Reserved Amount within sixty days of a Share Reserve failure and a Conversion Notice has been submitted to the Borrower,
Borrower shall be liable to pay the daily $2,000 cash penalty for failure to deliver shares. Such penalty shall continue to accrue
until such date as the Borrower increases the holders Share Reserve. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed
its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance
of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates
to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Note. 

 If, at any
time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of the Note. 

  1.4.                
   Method of Conversion .  

  a)                   
   Mechanics of Conversion . Subject to Section 1.1, this Note may be converted by the
Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion
(by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York,
New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower.  

  b)                   
   Surrender of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender
this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall
maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In
the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall,  prima   facie,  be controlling
and determinative in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as
aforesaid, the Holder may not transfer this Note unless the Holder first physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon
the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder (upon
payment by  

5   

the Holder of any applicable
transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note. The Holder and any
assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion
of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note represented by this Note may be less than the
amount stated on the face hereof. 

  c)                   
   Payment of Taxes . The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable
in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion
of this Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver
any such shares or other securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian
in whose street name such shares are to be held for the Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid
to the Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been
paid.  

  d)                   
   Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the
Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the
requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered
to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days
after such receipt (the  Deadline ) (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof,
surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.  

  e)                   
   Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock . Upon receipt by the Borrower of a duly
and properly executed Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced
to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect
to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other
securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion
as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect
to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay
in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation
or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other
circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The
Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received
by the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time, on such date.  

  f)                    
   Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates
representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company
( DTC ) Fast  

6   

Automated Securities Transfer
( FAST ) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1.1 and in
this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal
Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system. 

  g)                   
   Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting
the Holder s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if
delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline (including a failure due to
the circumstances described in Section 1.3 above)   the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $2,000 per day in cash, for each day
beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock through willful acts designed to hinder the delivery of
Common Stock to the Holder  . Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month
in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following
the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon
in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting
from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly
the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 1.4(g) are justified.  

  h)                   
   Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion .
In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if Borrower fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate
or certificates by the Deadline, and if and if after such Deadline the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in
an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder or Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common
Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon
the conversion relating to such Deadline (a  Buy-In ), then Borrower shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition
to any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase
price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale
price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B)
at the option of the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Note in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the
attempted conversion (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of
Common Stock that would have been issued if Borrower had timely complied with its delivery requirements. For example, if the Holder
purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of this
Note with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to
such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, Borrower shall be required
to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide Borrower written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in  

7   

respect of the Buy-In and, upon
request of Borrower, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other
remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or
injunctive relief with respect to Borrower s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

  1.5.                
   Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this
Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act
or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form,
substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred
may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Act (or a successor rule) ( Rule 144 ) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an  affiliate 
(as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section
1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement
(and subject to the removal provisions set forth below), until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of this Note have been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the
number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement or that has not been sold pursuant
to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a legend substantially in
the following form, as appropriate:   

   NEITHER THE ISSUANCE
AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE
BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED
FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY
ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID
ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR
FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES .  

8   

The legend set forth above shall be
removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i) the Borrower
or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel form,    substance    and    scope    customary    for
opinions of counsel in    comparable transactions, to the effect that a    public
sale or    transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the
Act, which opinion shall be accepted by    the    Company    so    that    the    sale    or    transfer    is   
or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder
under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction
as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Company does not
accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration,
such as Rule 144 or Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note 

1.6.                
   Effect of Certain Events .   

  a)                   
   Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc . At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance
or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or
series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation,
merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower
is not the survivor shall either: (i) be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower
shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default
Amount (as defined in Article III) or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof.  Person  shall mean any individual,
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization.  

  b)                   
   Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc . If, at any time when this Note is issued
and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Notes, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization,
reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same
or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case
of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete
liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note,
upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore
issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction
had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set
forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder
of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion
Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable
in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction
described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, thirty (30) days prior  

9   

written notice (but in any event
at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve, or if there
is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or
other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting
successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Section 1.6(b). The above
provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. 

  c)                   
   Adjustment Due to Distribution . If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution
of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of
capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the Borrower s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights
to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a  Distribution ), then the Holder of this
Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record for determining shareholders entitled to such
Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination
of shareholders entitled to such Distribution.  

  d)                   
   Adjustment Due to Dilutive Issuance.  If, at any time when the Note or any Conversion
Shares issuable upon conversion of the note, is issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues or sells, or in accordance with this
 Section 1.6(d)  hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock for no consideration or for a consideration
per share (before deduction of reasonable expenses or commissions or underwriting discounts or allowances in connection therewith)
less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such issuance (or deemed issuance) of such shares of Common Stock (a  Dilutive
Issuance ), then immediately upon the Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price will be reduced to the amount of the consideration
per share received by the Borrower in such Dilutive Issuance, but in no event shall the Conversion Price be above the original
Conversion Price.  

 The Borrower shall be deemed
to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or grants any warrants, rights or options (not
including employee stock option plans), whether or not immediately exercisable, to subscribe for or to purchase Common Stock or
other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock ( Convertible Securities ) (such warrants, rights
and options to purchase Common Stock or Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred to as  Options ) and the price
per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Conversion Price then in effect,
then the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. In the event Conversion Shares our outstanding and in the holder s
brokerage account, the Company shall issue an amount of additional shares such that the effective price shall equal the lower issuance
price. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise
of such Options  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration
for the issuance or granting of all such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable
to the Borrower upon the exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of
such Options, the minimum aggregate amount of additional 

10   

consideration payable upon the
conversion or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum
total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all such Options (assuming full conversion of Convertible
Securities, if applicable). No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such Common
Stock upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of
such Options. 

 Additionally, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities,
whether or not immediately convertible (other than where the same are issuable upon the exercise of Options), and the price per
share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then
the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share
for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any,
received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or sale of all such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Borrower upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time
such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will
be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

  e)                   
   Purchase Rights . If, at any time when any Notes are issued and outstanding, the Borrower
issues any convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (the  Purchase Rights )
pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock, then the Holder of this Note will be entitled to acquire, upon the
terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had
held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on
conversion contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase
Rights or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant,
issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.  

  f)                    
   Notice of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price as a result of the events described in this  Section 1.6 , the Borrower, at its expense, shall promptly compute
such adjustment or readjustment and prepare and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Borrower shall, upon the written request
at any time of the Holder, furnish to such Holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities
or property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Note.  

  1.7.                
   Trading Market Limitations . Unless permitted by the applicable rules and regulations
of the principal securities market on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded, in no event shall the Borrower issue upon
conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this  

11   

Note and the other Notes issued
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement more than the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that the Borrower can issue pursuant
to any rule of the principal United States securities market on which the Common Stock is then traded (the  Maximum Share
Amount ), which shall be 9.99% of the total shares outstanding on the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement),
subject to equitable adjustment from time to time for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, capital reorganizations and
similar events relating to the Common Stock occurring after the date hereof. Once the Maximum Share Amount has been issued, if
the Borrower fails to eliminate any prohibitions under applicable law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange, interdealer
quotation system or other self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over the Borrower or any of its securities on the Borrower s
ability to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Maximum Share Amount, in lieu of any further right to convert this Note,
this will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.3 of the Note. 

  1.8.                
   Status as Shareholder . Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by a Holder, (i) the
shares covered thereby (other than the shares, if any, which cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Holder s
allocated portion of the Reserved Amount or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii)
the Holder s rights as a Holder of such converted portion of this Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right
to receive certificates for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in
equity to such Holder because of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a Holder has not received certificates for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the expiration
of the Deadline with respect to a conversion of any portion of this Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects
to retain its status as a holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder shall regain the rights of a Holder of
this Note with respect to such unconverted portions of this Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted
Note to the Holder or, if the Note has not been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note has not
been converted. In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right
to receive Conversion Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default and any
subsequent Conversion Default and (ii) the right to have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined
in accordance with Section 1.3) for the Borrower s failure to convert this Note.  

  1.9.                
   Prepayment . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note, at any
time during the period beginning on the Issue Date the Borrower shall have the right, exercisable on not less than three (3) Trading
Days prior written notice to the Holder of the Note to prepay the outstanding Note (principal and accrued interest), in full, in
accordance with this Section 1.9. Any notice of prepayment hereunder (an  Optional Prepayment Notice ) shall be delivered
to the Holder of the Note at its registered addresses and shall state: (1) that the Borrower is exercising its right to prepay
the Note, and (2) the date of prepayment which shall be not more than three (3) Trading Days from the date of the Optional Prepayment
Notice. On the date fixed for prepayment (the  Optional Prepayment Date ), the Borrower shall make payment of the Optional
Prepayment Amount (as defined below) to or upon the order of the Holder as specified by the Holder in writing to the Borrower at
least one (1) business day prior to the Optional Prepayment Date. If the Borrower exercises its right to prepay the Note, the Borrower  

12   

shall make payment to the Holder
of an amount in cash (the  Optional Prepayment Amount ) equal to the Applicable Premium (as defined below) multiplied
by the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note  plus  (x) accrued and unpaid interest on
the unpaid principal amount of this Note to the Optional Prepayment Date  plus  (y) Default Interest, if any, on
the amounts referred to in clauses (w) and (x)  plus  (z) any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.2
and 1.4(g) hereof. If the Borrower delivers an Optional Prepayment Notice and fails to pay the Optional Prepayment Amount due to
the Holder of the Note within two (2) business days following the Optional Prepayment Date, the Borrower shall forever forfeit
its right to prepay the Note pursuant to this Section 1.9. 

After the expiration of one hundred
eighty (180) following the date of the Note, the Borrower shall have no right of prepayment.

the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privileges. All
rights and remedies existing hereunder are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

not constitute notice):   

  4.3.                
   Amendments . This Note and any provision hereof may only be amended by an instrument
in writing signed by the Borrower and the Holder. The term  Note  and all reference thereto, as used throughout this
instrument, shall mean this instrument (and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) as originally executed,
or if later amended or supplemented, then as so amended or supplemented.  

  4.4.                
   Assignability . This Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and
assigns, and shall inure to be the benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns. Each transferee of this Note must be an

  4.6.                
   Governing Law .  This Note shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws principles that would
result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction.  Any action brought by either party against
the other concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement must be brought only in the civil or state courts of
California or in the federal courts located in Los Angeles County.  Both parties and the individual signing this Agreement
on behalf of the Borrower agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.  The prevailing party shall be entitled
to recover from the other party its reasonable attorney s fees and costs.  In the event that any provision of this
Note is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to
the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision
which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or unenforceability of any other provision
of this Note. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed   

18   

or
operate to preclude the Holder from bringing suit or taking other legal action against the Borrower in any other jurisdiction to
collect on the Borrower s obligations to Holder, to realize on any collateral or any other security for such obligations,
or to enforce a judgment or other decision in favor of the Holder.   This Note shall be deemed an unconditional obligation
of Borrower for the payment of money and, without limitation to any other remedies of Holder, may be enforced against Borrower
by summary proceeding pursuant to any rule or statute in the jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.  For purposes
of such rule or statute, any other document or agreement to which Holder and Borrower are parties or which Borrower delivered to
Holder, which may be convenient or necessary to determine Holder s rights hereunder or Borrower s obligations to Holder
are deemed a part of this Note, whether or not such other document or agreement was delivered together herewith or was executed
apart from this Note.   

  4.7.                
   Certain Amounts . Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is required to pay an
amount in excess of the outstanding principal amount (or the portion thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and
unpaid interest plus Default Interest on such interest, the Borrower and the Holder agree that the actual damages to the Holder
from the receipt of cash payment on this Note may be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower represents
stipulated damages and not a penalty and is intended to compensate the Holder in part for loss of the opportunity to convert this
Note and to earn a return from the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of this Note at a price in excess of
the price paid for such shares pursuant to this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree that such amount of stipulated damages
is not plainly disproportionate to the possible loss to the Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to
convert this Note into shares of Common Stock.  

  4.8.                
   Disclosure . Upon receipt or delivery by the Company of any

such notice do not constitute material, non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company
shall within one (1) Trading Day after any such receipt or delivery, publicly disclose such material, non-public information on
a Current Report on Form 8-K or otherwise. In the event that the Company believes that a notice contains material, non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company so shall indicate to such Holder contemporaneously with delivery
of such notice, and in the absence of any such indication, the Holder shall be allowed to presume that all matters relating to
such notice do not constitute material, non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries.  

  4.9.                
   Purchase Agreement . By its acceptance of this Note, each party agrees to be bound by
the applicable terms of the Purchase Agreement.

Note shall have no rights as a Holder of Common Stock unless and only to the extent that it converts this Note into Common Stock.
The Borrower shall provide the Holder with prior notification of any meeting of the Borrower s shareholders (and copies of
proxy materials and other information sent to shareholders). In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of its shareholders
for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to receive  

19   

payment of any dividend or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, reclassification
or recapitalization) any share of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or for the purpose
of determining shareholders who are entitled to vote in connection with any proposed sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Borrower or any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Borrower, the Borrower shall mail
a notice to the Holder, at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date specified therein (or thirty (30) days prior to the
consummation of the transaction or event, whichever is earlier), of the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose
of such dividend, distribution, right or other event, and a brief statement regarding the amount and character of such dividend,
distribution, right or other event to the extent known at such time. The Borrower shall make a public announcement of any event
requiring notification to the Holder hereunder substantially simultaneously with the notification to the Holder in accordance with
the terms of this Section 4.9. 

  4.11.            
   Remedies . The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder
will cause irreparable harm to the Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly,
the Borrower acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees,
in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder shall be entitled,
in addition to all other available remedies at law or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction
or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof,
without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.  

  4.12.            
  Unconditional Obligation; No Offset.   Borrower
acknowledges that this Note is an unconditional, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Borrower not subject to offset, deduction
or counterclaim of any kind. Borrower hereby waives any rights of offset it now has or may have hereafter against Lender, its successors
and assigns, and agrees to make the payments or conversions called for herein in accordance with the terms of this Note.  

  4.13.            
   Severability . If any provision of this Note is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
balance of this Note shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless
remain applicable to all other persons and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest
due hereunder shall violate applicable laws governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically
be lowered to equal the maximum permitted rate of interest. The Borrower covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that
it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension
or usury law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Borrower from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest
on this Note as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this indenture, and the Borrower (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefits
or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impeded the execution
of any power herein granted to the Holder, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such as though no such law has been
enacted

CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE   

  FOR VALUE RECEIVED ,  GREY
CLOAK TECH INC.  a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the  Borrower ), hereby promises to pay to the order of
 WAYNE COLESON  a Colorado resident, or registered assigns (the  Holder ) the sum of  $5,000.00  together
with any interest as set forth herein, on  December 31, 2016  (the  Maturity Date ), and to pay interest on the
unpaid principal balance hereof at the rate of twelve (12%) (the  Interest Rate ) per annum from the date hereof (the
 Issue Date ) until the same becomes due and payable, whether at maturity or upon acceleration or by prepayment or
otherwise. This Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part except as otherwise explicitly set forth herein. Any amount of principal
or interest on this Note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of twenty-two (22%) per annum from the due
date thereof until the same is paid ( Default Interest ). Interest shall commence accruing on the date that the
Note is fully paid and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed. All payments
due hereunder (to the extent not converted into common stock, no par value per share (the  Common Stock ) in accordance
with the terms hereof) shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments shall be made at such address
as the Holder shall hereafter give to the Borrower by written notice made in accordance with the provisions of this Note. Whenever
any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which is not a business day, the same shall instead
be due on the next succeeding day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest payment date which is not the date on
which this Note is paid in full, the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
the amount of interest due on such date. As used in this Note, the term  business day  shall mean any day other than
a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which commercial banks in the city of New York, New York are authorized or required by law or executive
order to remain closed. Each capitalized term used herein, and not otherwise defined, shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in
that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated the date hereof, pursuant to which this Note was originally issued (the  Purchase
Agreement ). 

1   

This Note
is free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive
rights or other similar rights of shareholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof. 

 The following
terms shall apply to this Note: 

  ARTICLE
I.  CONVERSION RIGHTS 

  1.1.                
   Conversion Right . The Holder shall have the right from time to time, and at any time
during the period beginning on the date which is one hundred eighty one (181) days following the date of this Note and ending on
the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined in Article III) pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) or Article III, each in respect of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this Note to convert all or any
part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note into fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock, as
such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such
Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) determined
as provided herein (a  Conversion );  provided ,  however , that in no event shall the Holder be
entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the
number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may
be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion
of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained
herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which
the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more
than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso The number of shares
of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined
below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the  Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section
1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably
expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the  Conversion
Date ). The term  Conversion Amount  means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal
amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion  plus  (2) at the Holder s option, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date,  plus  (3)
at the Holder s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or
(2)  plus  (4) at the Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g)
hereof.  

  1.2.                
   Conversion Price .  

2   

a)                   
   Calculation of Conversion Price . The conversion price (the  Conversion Price )
shall equal the lesser of $0.20 or the Variable Conversion Price (as defined herein) (subject to equitable adjustments for stock
splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any
subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). The
 Variable Conversion Price  shall mean 50% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount
rate of 50%).  Market Price  means the lowest Trading Price (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the
twenty (20) Trading Day period ending on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date.  Trading Price 
means, for any security as of any date, the closing bid price on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or applicable trading market
(the  OTCQB ) as reported by a reliable reporting service ( Reporting Service ) designated by the Holder
(i.e. Bloomberg) or, if the OTCQB is not the principal trading market for such security, the closing bid price of such security
on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such security is listed or traded or, if no closing bid price of such
security is available in any of the foregoing manners, the average of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security
that are listed in the  pink sheets  by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. If the Trading Price cannot be calculated
for such security on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined
by the Borrower and the holders of a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading
Price is required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes.   Provided ,  however   ,  that
if the closing bid price for the common stock on the Clearing Date (defined below) is lower than the Closing Bid Price, then the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted such that the discount rate shall be taken from the closing bid price on the Clearing Date,
and the Company shall issue additional shares to the Holder to reflect such adjusted Conversion Price; and provided further, that
if the Company s common stock becomes chilled by Deposit Trust Corporation (DTC) at the time that any portion of the principal
and interest of this Note is converted by Holder, than the Variable Conversion Price shall be forty percent (representing a discount
of 60%) for so long as the Common Stock is chilled. For purposes of this Agreement, the Clearing Date shall be on the date in which
the Conversion Shares are deposited into the Holder s brokerage account and Holder s broker has confirmed with Holder
that the Holder may execute trades of the Conversion Shares without restriction. If such notice is received from the broker by
the Holder after 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, the notice shall be deemed to have been received on the next Trading Day.  Trading
Day  shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the OTCQB, or on the principal securities
exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded.   The Company shall be responsible for
the full cost and expense in connection with the issuance and delivery (expedited) of shares to the Borrower holder, including,
but not limited to the cost and issuance fees that may be charged by the Company s transfer agent to the holder upon each
Conversion Notice. In the event the transfer agent assess a cash charge to the Borrower upon any conversion, the Borrower may at
its election deduct the entire cost from the principal amount being converted.     

  b)                   
   Holder s Right of Alternative Conversion Price . If the Company in any manner
issues or sells or enters into any agreement to issue or sell, any Common Stock or Convertible Securities (any such securities,
 Variable Price Securities ) after the Closing Date that are issuable pursuant to such agreement or convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Options or Convertible Securities, as applicable, at  

3   

a price which varies or may vary
with the market price of the shares of Common Stock, including by way of one or more reset(s) to a fixed price, but exclusive of
such formulations reflecting customary anti-dilution provisions (such as share splits, share combinations, share dividends and
similar transactions) (each of the formulations for such variable price being herein referred to as, the  Other Variable
Price ), and the Other Variable Price is greater than the Variable Conversion Price then in effect under this Note, the Company
shall provide written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Buyer on the date of such agreement and/or the
issuance of such Convertible Securities or Options, as applicable. From and after the date the Company enters into such agreement
or issues any such Variable Price Securities, the Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion to
substitute the Other Variable Price for the Conversion Price upon conversion of this Note by designating in the Conversion Notice
delivered upon any conversion of this Note that solely for purposes of such conversion the Buyer is relying on the Other Variable
Price rather than the Conversion Price then in effect. The Buyer s election to rely on the Other Variable Price for a particular
conversion of this Note shall not obligate the Holder to rely on the Other Variable Price for any future conversion of this Note. 

  c)                   
   Conversion Price During Major Announcements . Notwithstanding anything contained in
Section 1.2(a) to the contrary, in the event the Borrower (i) makes a public announcement that it intends to consolidate or merge
with any other corporation (other than a merger in which the Borrower is the surviving or continuing corporation and its capital
stock is unchanged) or sell or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or (ii) any person, group or entity
(including the Borrower) publicly announces a tender offer to purchase 50% or more of the Borrower s Common Stock (or any
other takeover scheme) (the date of the announcement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) is hereinafter referred to as the  Announcement
Date ), then the Conversion Price shall, effective upon the Announcement Date and continuing through the Adjusted Conversion
Price Termination Date (as defined below), be equal to the lower of (x) the Conversion Price which would have been applicable for
a Conversion occurring on the Announcement Date and (y) the Conversion Price that would otherwise be in effect. From and after
the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date, the Conversion Price shall be determined as set forth in this Section 1.2(a). For
purposes hereof,  Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date  shall mean, with respect to any proposed transaction
or tender offer (or takeover scheme) for which a public announcement as contemplated by this Section 1.2(b) has been made, the
date upon which the Borrower (in the case of clause (i) above) or the person, group or entity (in the case of clause (ii) above)
consummates or publicly announces the termination or abandonment of the proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme)
which caused this Section 1.2(b) to become operative.  

  1.3.                
   Authorized Shares . The Borrower shall at all times have authorized, and reserved for
the purpose of issuance, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to provide for the full conversion or exercise of the outstanding
Note and issuance of the Conversion Shares in connection therewith (based on the Conversion Price of the Note in effect from time
to time) and as otherwise required by the Note. The Borrower shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon conversion of Note without the consent of the Buyer. The Borrower shall at all times maintain the number of shares
of Common Stock so reserved for issuance at an amount ( Reserved Amount ) equal to    three times   
the number that is then actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note and any additional Notes (based on the Conversion  

4   

Price of the Note in effect from
time to time). If at any time the number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved for issuance ( Authorized and
Reserved Shares ) is below the Reserved Amount, the Company will promptly, but in no event later than thirty days following
a Share Reserve failure, take all corporate action necessary to authorize and reserve a sufficient number of shares, including,
without limitation, calling a special meeting of shareholders to authorize additional shares to meet the Company s obligations
under this Section 1.3, in the case of an insufficient number of authorized shares, obtain shareholder approval of an increase
in such authorized number of shares, and voting the management shares of the Borrower in favor of an increase in the authorized
shares of the Borrower to ensure that the number of authorized shares is sufficient to meet the Reserved Amount. If the Borrower
fails to obtain such shareholder approval within thirty (30) days following the date on which the number of Reserved Amount exceeds
the Authorized and Reserved Shares, it will be considered an Event of default under the Note. In the event the Borrower fails to
increase the Reserved Amount within sixty days of a Share Reserve failure and a Conversion Notice has been submitted to the Borrower,
Borrower shall be liable to pay the daily $2,000 cash penalty for failure to deliver shares. Such penalty shall continue to accrue
until such date as the Borrower increases the holders Share Reserve. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed
its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance
of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates
to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Note. 

 If, at any
time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of the Note. 

  1.4.                
   Method of Conversion .  

  a)                   
   Mechanics of Conversion . Subject to Section 1.1, this Note may be converted by the
Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion
(by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York,
New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower.  

  b)                   
   Surrender of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender
this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall
maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In
the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall,  prima   facie,  be controlling
and determinative in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as
aforesaid, the Holder may not transfer this Note unless the Holder first physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon
the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder (upon
payment by  

5   

the Holder of any applicable
transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note. The Holder and any
assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion
of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note represented by this Note may be less than the
amount stated on the face hereof. 

  c)                   
   Payment of Taxes . The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable
in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion
of this Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver
any such shares or other securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian
in whose street name such shares are to be held for the Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid
to the Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been
paid.  

  d)                   
   Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the
Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the
requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered
to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days
after such receipt (the  Deadline ) (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof,
surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.  

  e)                   
   Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock . Upon receipt by the Borrower of a duly
and properly executed Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced
to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect
to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other
securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion
as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect
to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay
in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation
or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other
circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The
Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received
by the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time, on such date.  

  f)                    
   Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates
representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company
( DTC ) Fast  

6   

Automated Securities Transfer
( FAST ) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1.1 and in
this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal
Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system. 

  g)                   
   Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting
the Holder s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if
delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline (including a failure due to
the circumstances described in Section 1.3 above)   the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $2,000 per day in cash, for each day
beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock through willful acts designed to hinder the delivery of
Common Stock to the Holder  . Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month
in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following
the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon
in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting
from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly
the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 1.4(g) are justified.  

  h)                   
   Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion .
In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if Borrower fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate
or certificates by the Deadline, and if and if after such Deadline the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in
an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder or Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common
Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon
the conversion relating to such Deadline (a  Buy-In ), then Borrower shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition
to any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase
price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale
price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B)
at the option of the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Note in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the
attempted conversion (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of
Common Stock that would have been issued if Borrower had timely complied with its delivery requirements. For example, if the Holder
purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of this
Note with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to
such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, Borrower shall be required
to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide Borrower written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in  

7   

respect of the Buy-In and, upon
request of Borrower, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other
remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or
injunctive relief with respect to Borrower s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

  1.5.                
   Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this
Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act
or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form,
substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred
may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Act (or a successor rule) ( Rule 144 ) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an  affiliate 
(as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section
1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement
(and subject to the removal provisions set forth below), until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of this Note have been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the
number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable

   NEITHER THE ISSUANCE
AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE
BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED
FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY
ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID

The legend set forth above shall be
removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i) the Borrower
or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel form,    substance    and    scope    customary    for
opinions of counsel in    comparable transactions, to the effect that a    public
sale or    transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the
Act, which opinion shall be accepted by    the    Company    so    that    the    sale    or    transfer    is   
or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder
under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction
as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Company does not
accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration,
such as Rule 144 or Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note 

1.6.                
   Effect of Certain Events .   

  a)                   
   Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc . At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance
or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or
series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation,
merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower
is not the survivor shall either: (i) be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower
shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default
Amount (as defined in Article III) or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof.  Person  shall mean any individual,
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization.  

  b)                   
   Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc . If, at any time when this Note is issued
and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Notes, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization,
reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same
or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case
of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete
liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note,
upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore
issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction
had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set
forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder
of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion
Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable
in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction
described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, thirty (30) days prior  

9   

written notice (but in any event
at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve, or if there
is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or
other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting
successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Section 1.6(b). The above
provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. 

  c)                   
   Adjustment Due to Distribution . If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution
of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of
capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the Borrower s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights
to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a  Distribution ), then the Holder of this
Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record for determining shareholders entitled to such
Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination
of shareholders entitled to such Distribution.  

  d)                   
   Adjustment Due to Dilutive Issuance.  If, at any time when the Note or any Conversion
Shares issuable upon conversion of the note, is issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues or sells, or in accordance with this
 Section 1.6(d)  hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock for no consideration or for a consideration
per share (before deduction of reasonable expenses or commissions or underwriting discounts or allowances in connection therewith)
less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such issuance (or deemed issuance) of such shares of Common Stock (a  Dilutive
Issuance ), then immediately upon the Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price will be reduced to the amount of the consideration
per share received by the Borrower in such Dilutive Issuance, but in no event shall the Conversion Price be above the original
Conversion Price.  

 The Borrower shall be deemed
to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or grants any warrants, rights or options (not
including employee stock option plans), whether or not immediately exercisable, to subscribe for or to purchase Common Stock or
other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock ( Convertible Securities ) (such warrants, rights
and options to purchase Common Stock or Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred to as  Options ) and the price
per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Conversion Price then in effect,
then the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. In the event Conversion Shares our outstanding and in the holder s
brokerage account, the Company shall issue an amount of additional shares such that the effective price shall equal the lower issuance
price. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise
of such Options  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration
for the issuance or granting of all such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable
to the Borrower upon the exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of
such Options, the minimum aggregate amount of additional 

10   

consideration payable upon the
conversion or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum
total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all such Options (assuming full conversion of Convertible
Securities, if applicable). No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such Common
Stock upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of
such Options. 

 Additionally, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities,
whether or not immediately convertible (other than where the same are issuable upon the exercise of Options), and the price per
share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then
the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share
for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any,
received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or sale of all such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Borrower upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time
such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will
be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

  e)                   
   Purchase Rights . If, at any time when any Notes are issued and outstanding, the Borrower
issues any convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (the  Purchase Rights )
pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock, then the Holder of this Note will be entitled to acquire, upon the
terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had
held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on
conversion contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase
Rights or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant,
issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.  

  f)                    
   Notice of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price as a result of the events described in this  Section 1.6 , the Borrower, at its expense, shall promptly compute
such adjustment or readjustment and prepare and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Borrower shall, upon the written request
at any time of the Holder, furnish to such Holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities
or property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Note.  

  1.7.                
   Trading Market Limitations . Unless permitted by the applicable rules and regulations
of the principal securities market on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded, in no event shall the Borrower issue upon
conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this  

11   

Note and the other Notes issued
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement more than the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that the Borrower can issue pursuant
to any rule of the principal United States securities market on which the Common Stock is then traded (the  Maximum Share
Amount ), which shall be 9.99% of the total shares outstanding on the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement),
subject to equitable adjustment from time to time for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, capital reorganizations and
similar events relating to the Common Stock occurring after the date hereof. Once the Maximum Share Amount has been issued, if
the Borrower fails to eliminate any prohibitions under applicable law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange, interdealer
quotation system or other self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over the Borrower or any of its securities on the Borrower s
ability to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Maximum Share Amount, in lieu of any further right to convert this Note,
this will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.3 of the Note. 

  1.8.                
   Status as Shareholder . Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by a Holder, (i) the
shares covered thereby (other than the shares, if any, which cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Holder s
allocated portion of the Reserved Amount or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii)
the Holder s rights as a Holder of such converted portion of this Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right
to receive certificates for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in
equity to such Holder because of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a Holder has not received certificates for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the expiration
of the Deadline with respect to a conversion of any portion of this Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects
to retain its status as a holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder shall regain the rights of a Holder of
this Note with respect to such unconverted portions of this Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted
Note to the Holder or, if the Note has not been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note has not
been converted. In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right
to receive Conversion Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default and any
subsequent Conversion Default and (ii) the right to have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined
in accordance with Section 1.3) for the Borrower s failure to convert this Note.  

  1.9.                
   Prepayment . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note, at any
time during the period beginning on the Issue Date the Borrower shall have the right, exercisable on not less than three (3) Trading
Days prior written notice to the Holder of the Note to prepay the outstanding Note (principal and accrued interest), in full, in
accordance with this Section 1.9. Any notice of prepayment hereunder (an  Optional Prepayment Notice ) shall be delivered
to the Holder of the Note at its registered addresses and shall state: (1) that the Borrower is exercising its right to prepay
the Note, and (2) the date of prepayment which shall be not more than three (3) Trading Days from the date of the Optional Prepayment
Notice. On the date fixed for prepayment (the  Optional Prepayment Date ), the Borrower shall make payment of the Optional
Prepayment Amount (as defined below) to or upon the order of the Holder as specified by the Holder in writing to the Borrower at
least one (1) business day prior to the Optional Prepayment Date. If the Borrower exercises its right to prepay the Note, the Borrower  

12   

shall make payment to the Holder
of an amount in cash (the  Optional Prepayment Amount ) equal to the Applicable Premium (as defined below) multiplied
by the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note  plus  (x) accrued and unpaid interest on
the unpaid principal amount of this Note to the Optional Prepayment Date  plus  (y) Default Interest, if any, on
the amounts referred to in clauses (w) and (x)  plus  (z) any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.2
and 1.4(g) hereof. If the Borrower delivers an Optional Prepayment Notice and fails to pay the Optional Prepayment Amount due to
the Holder of the Note within two (2) business days following the Optional Prepayment Date, the Borrower shall forever forfeit
its right to prepay the Note pursuant to this Section 1.9. 

After the expiration of one hundred
eighty (180) following the date of the Note, the Borrower shall have no right of prepayment.

any, on the amounts referred to in clauses (w) and/or (x)  plus  (z) any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to
Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof (the then outstanding principal amount of this Note to the date of payment  plus  the
amounts referred to in clauses (x), (y) and (z) shall collectively be known as the  Default Sum ) or (ii) the  parity
value  of the Default Sum to be prepaid, where parity value means (a) the highest number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to such Default Sum in accordance with Article I, treating the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Mandatory Prepayment Date as the  Conversion Date  for purposes of determining the lowest applicable
Conversion Price, unless the Default Event arises as a result of a breach in respect of a specific Conversion Date in which case
such Conversion Date shall be the Conversion Date),  multiplied by  (b) the highest Closing Price for the Common
Stock during the period beginning on the date of first occurrence of the Event of Default and ending one day prior to the Mandatory
Prepayment Date (the  Default Amount ) and all other amounts payable hereunder shall immediately become due and payable,
all without demand, presentment or notice, all of which hereby are expressly waived, together with all costs, including, without
limitation, legal fees and expenses, of collection, and the Holder shall be entitled to exercise all other rights and remedies
available at law or in equity. 

 If the Borrower fails to pay the
Default Amount within five (5) business days of written notice that such amount is due and payable, then the Holder shall have
the right at any time, so long as the Borrower remains in default (and so long and to the extent that there are sufficient authorized
shares), to require the Borrower, upon written notice, to immediately issue, in lieu of the Default Amount, the number of shares
of Common Stock of the Borrower equal to the Default Amount divided by the Conversion Price which shall be so that the Variable
Conversion Price equals 40% (discount of 60%)

  4.1.                
   Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver . No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in

of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privileges. All
rights and remedies existing hereunder are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

not constitute notice):   

  4.3.                
   Amendments . This Note and any provision hereof may only be amended by an instrument
in writing signed by the Borrower and the Holder. The term  Note  and all reference thereto, as used throughout this
instrument, shall mean this instrument (and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) as originally executed,
or if later amended or supplemented, then as so amended or supplemented.  

  4.4.                
   Assignability . This Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and
assigns, and shall inure to be the benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns. Each transferee of this Note must be an
 accredited investor  (as defined in Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Act). Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the contrary,

   Cost of Collection . If default is made in the payment of this Note, the Borrower shall
pay the Holder hereof costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys  fees.  

  4.6.                
   Governing Law .  This Note shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws principles that would
result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction.  Any action brought by either party against
the other concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement must be brought only in the civil or state courts of
California or in the federal courts located in Los Angeles County.  Both parties and the individual signing this Agreement
on behalf of the Borrower agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.  The prevailing party shall be entitled
to recover from the other party its reasonable attorney s fees and costs.  In the event that any provision of this
Note is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to
the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision
which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or unenforceability of any other provision
of this Note. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed   

18   

or
operate to preclude the Holder from bringing suit or taking other legal action against the Borrower in any other jurisdiction to
collect on the Borrower s obligations to Holder, to realize on any collateral or any other security for such obligations,
or to enforce a judgment or other decision in favor of the Holder.   This Note shall be deemed an unconditional obligation
of Borrower for the payment of money and, without limitation to any other remedies of Holder, may be enforced against Borrower
by summary proceeding pursuant to any rule or statute in the jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.  For purposes
of such rule or statute, any other document or agreement to which Holder and Borrower are parties or which Borrower delivered to
Holder, which may be convenient or necessary to determine Holder s rights hereunder or Borrower s obligations to Holder
are deemed a part of this Note, whether or not such other document or agreement was delivered together herewith or was executed
apart from this Note.   

  4.7.                
   Certain Amounts . Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is required to pay an
amount in excess of the outstanding principal amount (or the portion thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and
unpaid interest plus Default Interest on such interest, the Borrower and the Holder agree that the actual damages to the Holder
from the receipt of cash payment on this Note may be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower represents
stipulated damages and not a penalty and is intended to compensate the Holder in part for loss of the opportunity to convert this
Note and to earn a return from the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of this Note at a price in excess of
the price paid for such shares pursuant to this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree that such amount of stipulated damages
is not plainly disproportionate to the possible loss to the Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to
convert this Note into shares of Common Stock.  

  4.8.                
   Disclosure . Upon receipt or delivery by the Company of any
notice in accordance with the terms of this Note, unless the Company has in good faith determined that the matters relating to
such notice do not constitute material, non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company
shall within one (1) Trading Day after any such receipt or delivery, publicly disclose such material, non-public information on
a Current Report on Form 8-K or otherwise. In the event that the Company believes that a notice contains material, non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company so shall indicate to such Holder contemporaneously with delivery
of such notice, and in the absence of any such indication, the Holder shall be allowed to presume that all matters relating to
such notice do not constitute material, non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries.  

  4.9.                
   Purchase Agreement . By its acceptance of this Note, each party agrees to be bound by
the applicable terms of the Purchase Agreement.  

  4.10.            
   Notice of Corporate Events . Except as otherwise provided below, the Holder of this
Note shall have no rights as a Holder of Common Stock unless and only to the extent that it converts this Note into Common Stock.
The Borrower shall provide the Holder with prior notification of any meeting of the Borrower s shareholders (and copies of
proxy materials and other information sent to shareholders). In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of its shareholders
for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to receive  

19   

payment of any dividend or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, reclassification
or recapitalization) any share of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or for the purpose
of determining shareholders who are entitled to vote in connection with any proposed sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Borrower or any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Borrower, the Borrower shall mail
a notice to the Holder, at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date specified therein (or thirty (30) days prior to the
consummation of the transaction or event, whichever is earlier), of the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose
of such dividend, distribution, right or other event, and a brief statement regarding the amount and character of such dividend,
distribution, right or other event to the extent known at such time. The Borrower shall make a public announcement of any event
requiring notification to the Holder hereunder substantially simultaneously with the notification to the Holder in accordance with
the terms of this Section 4.9. 

  4.11.            
   Remedies . The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder
will cause irreparable harm to the Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly,
the Borrower acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees,
in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder shall be entitled,
in addition to all other available remedies at law or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction
or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof,
without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.  

  4.12.            
  Unconditional Obligation; No Offset.   Borrower
acknowledges that this Note is an unconditional, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Borrower not subject to offset, deduction
or counterclaim of any kind. Borrower hereby waives any rights of offset it now has or may have hereafter against Lender, its successors
and assigns, and agrees to make the payments or conversions called for herein in accordance with the terms of this Note.  

  4.13.            
   Severability . If any provision of this Note is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
balance of this Note shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless
remain applicable to all other persons and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest
due hereunder shall violate applicable laws governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically
be lowered to equal the maximum permitted rate of interest. The Borrower covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that
it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension
or usury law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Borrower from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest
on this Note as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this indenture, and the Borrower (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefits
or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impeded the execution
of any power herein granted to the Holder, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such as though no such law has been
enacted

  FOR VALUE RECEIVED ,  GREY
CLOAK TECH INC.  a Nevada corporation (hereinafter called the  Borrower ), hereby promises to pay to the order of
 VERA GROUP, LLC  a South Dakota limited partnership, or registered assigns (the  Holder ) the sum of  $45,000.00 
together with any interest as set forth herein, on  December 31, 2016  (the  Maturity Date ), and to pay interest
on the unpaid principal balance hereof at the rate of twelve (12%) (the  Interest Rate ) per annum from the date hereof

with the terms hereof) shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America. All payments shall be made at such address

be due on the next succeeding day which is a business day and, in the case of any interest payment date which is not the date on
which this Note is paid in full, the extension of the due date thereof shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
the amount of interest due on such date. As used in this Note, the term  business day  shall mean any day other than
a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which commercial banks in the city of New York, New York are authorized or required by law or executive
order to remain closed. Each capitalized term used herein, and not otherwise defined, shall have the meaning ascribed thereto in
that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated the date hereof, pursuant to which this Note was originally issued (the  Purchase
Agreement ).

This Note
is free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive
rights or other similar rights of shareholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof. 

 The following
terms shall apply to this Note: 

  ARTICLE
I.  CONVERSION RIGHTS 

  1.1.                
   Conversion Right . The Holder shall have the right from time to time, and at any time
during the period beginning on the date which is one hundred eighty one (181) days following the date of this Note and ending on
the later of: (i) the Maturity Date and (ii) the date of payment of the Default Amount (as defined in Article III) pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) or Article III, each in respect of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this Note to convert all or any
part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note into fully paid and non- assessable shares of Common Stock, as
such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such
Common Stock shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the conversion price (the  Conversion Price ) determined
as provided herein (a  Conversion );  provided ,  however , that in no event shall the Holder be
entitled to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that portion of this Note upon conversion of which the sum of (1) the
number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common Stock which may
be deemed beneficially owned through the ownership of the unconverted portion of the Notes or the unexercised or unconverted portion
of any other security of the Borrower subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitations contained
herein) and (2) the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the conversion of the portion of this Note with respect to which
the determination of this proviso is being made, would result in beneficial ownership by the Holder and its affiliates of more
than 9.99% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock. For purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ), and Regulations 13D-G thereunder, except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso The number of shares
of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined
below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the  Notice of Conversion ), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section
1.4 below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably
expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the  Conversion
Date ). The term  Conversion Amount  means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal
amount of this Note to be converted in such conversion  plus  (2) at the Holder s option, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, on such principal amount at the interest rates provided in this Note to the Conversion Date,  plus  (3)
at the Holder s option, Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in the immediately preceding clauses (1) and/or
(2)  plus  (4) at the Holder s option, any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g)
hereof.  

  1.2.                
   Conversion Price .  

2   

a)                   
   Calculation of Conversion Price . The conversion price (the  Conversion Price )
shall equal the lesser of $0.20 or the Variable Conversion Price (as defined herein) (subject to equitable adjustments for stock
splits, stock dividends or rights offerings by the Borrower relating to the Borrower s securities or the securities of any
subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations, recapitalization, reclassifications, extraordinary distributions and similar events). The
 Variable Conversion Price  shall mean 50% multiplied by the Market Price (as defined herein) (representing a discount
rate of 50%).  Market Price  means the lowest Trading Price (as defined below) for the Common Stock during the
twenty (20) Trading Day period ending on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date.  Trading Price 
means, for any security as of any date, the closing bid price on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board, or applicable trading market
(the  OTCQB ) as reported by a reliable reporting service ( Reporting Service ) designated by the Holder
(i.e. Bloomberg) or, if the OTCQB is not the principal trading market for such security, the closing bid price of such security
on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such security is listed or traded or, if no closing bid price of such
security is available in any of the foregoing manners, the average of the closing bid prices of any market makers for such security
that are listed in the  pink sheets  by the National Quotation Bureau, Inc. If the Trading Price cannot be calculated
for such security on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined
by the Borrower and the holders of a majority in interest of the Notes being converted for which the calculation of the Trading
Price is required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes.   Provided ,  however   ,  that
if the closing bid price for the common stock on the Clearing Date (defined below) is lower than the Closing Bid Price, then the
Conversion Price shall be adjusted such that the discount rate shall be taken from the closing bid price on the Clearing Date,
and the Company shall issue additional shares to the Holder to reflect such adjusted Conversion Price; and provided further, that
if the Company s common stock becomes chilled by Deposit Trust Corporation (DTC) at the time that any portion of the principal
and interest of this Note is converted by Holder, than the Variable Conversion Price shall be forty percent (representing a discount
of 60%) for so long as the Common Stock is chilled. For purposes of this Agreement, the Clearing Date shall be on the date in which
the Conversion Shares are deposited into the Holder s brokerage account and Holder s broker has confirmed with Holder
that the Holder may execute trades of the Conversion Shares without restriction. If such notice is received from the broker by
the Holder after 12:00 PM Eastern Standard Time, the notice shall be deemed to have been received on the next Trading Day.  Trading
Day  shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is tradable for any period on the OTCQB, or on the principal securities
exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being traded.   The Company shall be responsible for
the full cost and expense in connection with the issuance and delivery (expedited) of shares to the Borrower holder, including,
but not limited to the cost and issuance fees that may be charged by the Company s transfer agent to the holder upon each
Conversion Notice. In the event the transfer agent assess a cash charge to the Borrower upon any conversion, the Borrower may at
its election deduct the entire cost from the principal amount being converted.     

  b)                   
   Holder s Right of Alternative Conversion Price . If the Company in any manner
issues or sells or enters into any agreement to issue or sell, any Common Stock or Convertible Securities (any such securities,
 Variable Price Securities ) after the Closing Date that are issuable pursuant to such agreement or convertible into
or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Options or Convertible Securities, as applicable, at  

3   

a price which varies or may vary
with the market price of the shares of Common Stock, including by way of one or more reset(s) to a fixed price, but exclusive of
such formulations reflecting customary anti-dilution provisions (such as share splits, share combinations, share dividends and
similar transactions) (each of the formulations for such variable price being herein referred to as, the  Other Variable
Price ), and the Other Variable Price is greater than the Variable Conversion Price then in effect under this Note, the Company
shall provide written notice thereof via facsimile and overnight courier to the Buyer on the date of such agreement and/or the
issuance of such Convertible Securities or Options, as applicable. From and after the date the Company enters into such agreement
or issues any such Variable Price Securities, the Buyer shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion to
substitute the Other Variable Price for the Conversion Price upon conversion of this Note by designating in the Conversion Notice
delivered upon any conversion of this Note that solely for purposes of such conversion the Buyer is relying on the Other Variable
Price rather than the Conversion Price then in effect. The Buyer s election to rely on the Other Variable Price for a particular
conversion of this Note shall not obligate the Holder to rely on the Other Variable Price for any future conversion of this Note. 

  c)                   
   Conversion Price During Major Announcements . Notwithstanding anything contained in
Section 1.2(a) to the contrary, in the event the Borrower (i) makes a public announcement that it intends to consolidate or merge
with any other corporation (other than a merger in which the Borrower is the surviving or continuing corporation and its capital
stock is unchanged) or sell or transfer all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or (ii) any person, group or entity
(including the Borrower) publicly announces a tender offer to purchase 50% or more of the Borrower s Common Stock (or any
other takeover scheme) (the date of the announcement referred to in clause (i) or (ii) is hereinafter referred to as the  Announcement
Date ), then the Conversion Price shall, effective upon the Announcement Date and continuing through the Adjusted Conversion
Price Termination Date (as defined below), be equal to the lower of (x) the Conversion Price which would have been applicable for
a Conversion occurring on the Announcement Date and (y) the Conversion Price that would otherwise be in effect. From and after
the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date, the Conversion Price shall be determined as set forth in this Section 1.2(a). For
purposes hereof,  Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date  shall mean, with respect to any proposed transaction
or tender offer (or takeover scheme) for which a public announcement as contemplated by this Section 1.2(b) has been made, the
date upon which the Borrower (in the case of clause (i) above) or the person, group or entity (in the case of clause (ii) above)
consummates or publicly announces the termination or abandonment of the proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme)
which caused this Section 1.2(b) to become operative.  

  1.3.                
   Authorized Shares . The Borrower shall at all times have authorized, and reserved for
the purpose of issuance, a sufficient number of shares of Common Stock to provide for the full conversion or exercise of the outstanding
Note and issuance of the Conversion Shares in connection therewith (based on the Conversion Price of the Note in effect from time
to time) and as otherwise required by the Note. The Borrower shall not reduce the number of shares of Common Stock reserved for
issuance upon conversion of Note without the consent of the Buyer. The Borrower shall at all times maintain the number of shares
of Common Stock so reserved for issuance at an amount ( Reserved Amount ) equal to    three times   
the number that is then actually issuable upon full conversion of the Note and any additional Notes (based on the Conversion  

4   

Price of the Note in effect from
time to time). If at any time the number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved for issuance ( Authorized and
Reserved Shares ) is below the Reserved Amount, the Company will promptly, but in no event later than thirty days following
a Share Reserve failure, take all corporate action necessary to authorize and reserve a sufficient number of shares, including,
without limitation, calling a special meeting of shareholders to authorize additional shares to meet the Company s obligations
under this Section 1.3, in the case of an insufficient number of authorized shares, obtain shareholder approval of an increase
in such authorized number of shares, and voting the management shares of the Borrower in favor of an increase in the authorized
shares of the Borrower to ensure that the number of authorized shares is sufficient to meet the Reserved Amount. If the Borrower
fails to obtain such shareholder approval within thirty (30) days following the date on which the number of Reserved Amount exceeds
the Authorized and Reserved Shares, it will be considered an Event of default under the Note. In the event the Borrower fails to
increase the Reserved Amount within sixty days of a Share Reserve failure and a Conversion Notice has been submitted to the Borrower,
Borrower shall be liable to pay the daily $2,000 cash penalty for failure to deliver shares. Such penalty shall continue to accrue
until such date as the Borrower increases the holders Share Reserve. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it has irrevocably instructed
its transfer agent to issue certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance
of this Note shall constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of executing stock certificates
to execute and issue the necessary certificates for shares of Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Note. 

 If, at any
time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.2 of the Note. 

  1.4.                
   Method of Conversion .  

  a)                   
   Mechanics of Conversion . Subject to Section 1.1, this Note may be converted by the
Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after the Issue Date, by (A) submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion
(by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York,
New York time) and (B) subject to Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower.  

  b)                   
   Surrender of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender
this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall
maintain records showing the principal amount so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In
the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Borrower shall,  prima   facie,  be controlling
and determinative in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as
aforesaid, the Holder may not transfer this Note unless the Holder first physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon
the Borrower will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder (upon
payment by  

5   

the Holder of any applicable
transfer taxes) may request, representing in the aggregate the remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note. The Holder and any
assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion
of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted principal amount of this Note represented by this Note may be less than the
amount stated on the face hereof. 

  c)                   
   Payment of Taxes . The Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable
in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of shares of Common Stock or other securities or property on conversion
of this Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue or deliver
any such shares or other securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian
in whose street name such shares are to be held for the Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid
to the Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been
paid.  

  d)                   
   Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon receipt by the Borrower from the
Holder of a facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) of a Notice of Conversion meeting the
requirements for conversion as provided in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered
to or upon the order of the Holder certificates for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion within three (3) business days
after such receipt (the  Deadline ) (and, solely in the case of conversion of the entire unpaid principal amount hereof,
surrender of this Note) in accordance with the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement.  

  e)                   
   Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock . Upon receipt by the Borrower of a duly
and properly executed Notice of Conversion, the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the Common Stock issuable
upon such conversion, the outstanding principal amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid interest on this Note shall be reduced
to reflect such conversion, and, unless the Borrower defaults on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect
to the portion of this Note being so converted shall forthwith terminate except the right to receive the Common Stock or other
securities, cash or other assets, as herein provided, on such conversion. If the Holder shall have given a Notice of Conversion
as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the certificates for Common Stock shall be absolute and
unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect
to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay
in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation
or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of any other
circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The
Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received
by the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time, on such date.  

  f)                    
   Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic Transfer . In lieu of delivering physical certificates
representing the Common Stock issuable upon conversion, provided the Borrower is participating in the Depository Trust Company
( DTC ) Fast  

6   

Automated Securities Transfer
( FAST ) program, upon request of the Holder and its compliance with the provisions contained in Section 1.1 and in
this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall use its best efforts to cause its transfer agent to electronically transmit the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion to the Holder by crediting the account of Holder s Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit Withdrawal
Agent Commission ( DWAC ) system. 

  g)                   
   Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any way limiting
the Holder s right to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if
delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered by the Deadline (including a failure due to
the circumstances described in Section 1.3 above)   the Borrower shall pay to the Holder $2,000 per day in cash, for each day
beyond the Deadline that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock through willful acts designed to hinder the delivery of
Common Stock to the Holder  . Such cash amount shall be paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month
in which it has accrued or, at the option of the Holder (by written notice to the Borrower by the first day of the month following
the month in which it has accrued), shall be added to the principal amount of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon
in accordance with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting
from a failure, attempt to frustrate, interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to qualify. Accordingly
the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provision contained in this Section 1.4(g) are justified.  

  h)                   
   Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Certificates Upon Conversion .
In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if Borrower fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such certificate
or certificates by the Deadline, and if and if after such Deadline the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in
an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder or Holder s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common
Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon
the conversion relating to such Deadline (a  Buy-In ), then Borrower shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition
to any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder s total purchase
price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number
of shares of Common Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale
price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B)
at the option of the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Note in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the
attempted conversion (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of
Common Stock that would have been issued if Borrower had timely complied with its delivery requirements. For example, if the Holder
purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of this
Note with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to
such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, Borrower shall be required
to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide Borrower written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in  

7   

respect of the Buy-In and, upon
request of Borrower, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder s right to pursue any other
remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or
injunctive relief with respect to Borrower s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock upon
conversion of this Note as required pursuant to the terms hereof. 

  1.5.                
   Concerning the Shares . The shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this
Note may not be sold or transferred unless (i) such shares are sold pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act
or (ii) the Borrower or its transfer agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of counsel (which opinion shall be in form,
substance and scope customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to be sold or transferred
may be sold or transferred pursuant to an exemption from such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred pursuant
to Rule 144 under the Act (or a successor rule) ( Rule 144 ) or (iv) such shares are transferred to an  affiliate 
(as defined in Rule 144) of the Borrower who agrees to sell or otherwise transfer the shares only in accordance with this Section
1.5 and who is an Accredited Investor (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement
(and subject to the removal provisions set forth below), until such time as the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of this Note have been registered under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the
number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold, each certificate for shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of this Note that has not been so included in an effective registration statement or that has not been sold pursuant
to an effective registration statement or an exemption that permits removal of the legend, shall bear a legend substantially in
the following form, as appropriate:   

   NEITHER THE ISSUANCE
AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE NOR THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH THESE SECURITIES ARE EXERCISABLE HAVE
BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED
FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL (WHICH COUNSEL SHALL BE SELECTED BY THE HOLDER), IN A GENERALLY
ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT OR (II) UNLESS SOLD PURSUANT TO RULE 144 OR RULE 144A UNDER SAID
ACT. NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE SECURITIES MAY BE PLEDGED IN CONNECTION WITH A BONA FIDE MARGIN ACCOUNT OR OTHER LOAN OR
FINANCING ARRANGEMENT SECURED BY THE SECURITIES .  

8   

The legend set forth above shall be
removed and the Borrower shall issue to the Holder a new certificate therefore free of any transfer legend if (i) the Borrower
or its transfer agent shall have received an opinion of counsel form,    substance    and    scope    customary    for
opinions of counsel in    comparable transactions, to the effect that a    public
sale or    transfer of such Common Stock may be made without registration under the
Act, which opinion shall be accepted by    the    Company    so    that    the    sale    or    transfer    is   
or (ii) in the case of the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note, such security is registered for sale by the Holder
under an effective registration statement filed under the Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction
as to the number of securities as of a particular date that can then be immediately sold. In the event that the Company does not
accept the opinion of counsel provided by the Buyer with respect to the transfer of Securities pursuant to an exemption from registration,
such as Rule 144 or Regulation S, at the Deadline, it will be considered an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.2 of the Note 

1.6.                
   Effect of Certain Events .   

  a)                   
   Effect of Merger, Consolidation, Etc . At the option of the Holder, the sale, conveyance
or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the effectuation by the Borrower of a transaction or
series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the Borrower is disposed of, or the consolidation,
merger or other business combination of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or Persons when the Borrower
is not the survivor shall either: (i) be deemed to be an Event of Default (as defined in Article III) pursuant to which the Borrower
shall be required to pay to the Holder upon the consummation of and as a condition to such transaction an amount equal to the Default
Amount (as defined in Article III) or (ii) be treated pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof.  Person  shall mean any individual,
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association, trust or other entity or organization.  

  b)                   
   Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc . If, at any time when this Note is issued
and outstanding and prior to conversion of all of the Notes, there shall be any merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization,
reorganization, or other similar event, as a result of which shares of Common Stock of the Borrower shall be changed into the same
or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower or another entity, or in case
of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a plan of complete
liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to receive upon conversion of this Note,
upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore
issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction
had this Note been converted in full immediately prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set
forth herein), and in any such case appropriate provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder
of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion
Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable
in relation to any securities or assets thereafter deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The Borrower shall not affect any transaction
described in this Section 1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives, to the extent practicable, thirty (30) days prior  

9   

written notice (but in any event
at least fifteen (15) days prior written notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve, or if there
is no such record date, the consummation of, such merger, consolidation, exchange of shares, recapitalization, reorganization or
other similar event or sale of assets (during which time the Holder shall be entitled to convert this Note) and (b) the resulting
successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) assumes by written instrument the obligations of this Section 1.6(b). The above
provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations, mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges. 

  c)                   
   Adjustment Due to Distribution . If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution
of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of
capital or otherwise (including any dividend or distribution to the Borrower s shareholders in cash or shares (or rights
to acquire shares) of capital stock of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a  Distribution ), then the Holder of this
Note shall be entitled, upon any conversion of this Note after the date of record for determining shareholders entitled to such
Distribution, to receive the amount of such assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the determination
of shareholders entitled to such Distribution.  

  d)                   
   Adjustment Due to Dilutive Issuance.  If, at any time when the Note or any Conversion
Shares issuable upon conversion of the note, is issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues or sells, or in accordance with this
 Section 1.6(d)  hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock for no consideration or for a consideration
per share (before deduction of reasonable expenses or commissions or underwriting discounts or allowances in connection therewith)
less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such issuance (or deemed issuance) of such shares of Common Stock (a  Dilutive
Issuance ), then immediately upon the Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price will be reduced to the amount of the consideration
per share received by the Borrower in such Dilutive Issuance, but in no event shall the Conversion Price be above the original
Conversion Price.  

 The Borrower shall be deemed
to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or grants any warrants, rights or options (not
including employee stock option plans), whether or not immediately exercisable, to subscribe for or to purchase Common Stock or
other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock ( Convertible Securities ) (such warrants, rights
and options to purchase Common Stock or Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred to as  Options ) and the price
per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Conversion Price then in effect,
then the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. In the event Conversion Shares our outstanding and in the holder s
brokerage account, the Company shall issue an amount of additional shares such that the effective price shall equal the lower issuance
price. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share for which Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise
of such Options  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration
for the issuance or granting of all such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable
to the Borrower upon the exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of
such Options, the minimum aggregate amount of additional 

10   

consideration payable upon the
conversion or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum
total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all such Options (assuming full conversion of Convertible
Securities, if applicable). No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such Common
Stock upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of
such Options. 

 Additionally, the Borrower shall
be deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common Stock if the Borrower in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities,
whether or not immediately convertible (other than where the same are issuable upon the exercise of Options), and the price per
share for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then
the Conversion Price shall be equal to such price per share. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share
for which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any,
received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or sale of all such Convertible Securities, plus the minimum
aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Borrower upon the conversion or exchange thereof at the time
such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum total number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities. No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will
be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities. 

  e)                   
   Purchase Rights . If, at any time when any Notes are issued and outstanding, the Borrower
issues any convertible securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (the  Purchase Rights )
pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock, then the Holder of this Note will be entitled to acquire, upon the
terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had
held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on
conversion contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase
Rights or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant,
issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.  

  f)                    
   Notice of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the
Conversion Price as a result of the events described in this  Section 1.6 , the Borrower, at its expense, shall promptly compute
such adjustment or readjustment and prepare and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment
and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Borrower shall, upon the written request
at any time of the Holder, furnish to such Holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the
Conversion Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities
or property which at the time would be received upon conversion of the Note.  

  1.7.                
   Trading Market Limitations . Unless permitted by the applicable rules and regulations
of the principal securities market on which the Common Stock is then listed or traded, in no event shall the Borrower issue upon
conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this  

11   

Note and the other Notes issued
pursuant to the Purchase Agreement more than the maximum number of shares of Common Stock that the Borrower can issue pursuant
to any rule of the principal United States securities market on which the Common Stock is then traded (the  Maximum Share
Amount ), which shall be 9.99% of the total shares outstanding on the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement),
subject to equitable adjustment from time to time for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, capital reorganizations and
similar events relating to the Common Stock occurring after the date hereof. Once the Maximum Share Amount has been issued, if
the Borrower fails to eliminate any prohibitions under applicable law or the rules or regulations of any stock exchange, interdealer
quotation system or other self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over the Borrower or any of its securities on the Borrower s
ability to issue shares of Common Stock in excess of the Maximum Share Amount, in lieu of any further right to convert this Note,
this will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.3 of the Note. 

  1.8.                
   Status as Shareholder . Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion by a Holder, (i) the
shares covered thereby (other than the shares, if any, which cannot be issued because their issuance would exceed such Holder s
allocated portion of the Reserved Amount or Maximum Share Amount) shall be deemed converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii)
the Holder s rights as a Holder of such converted portion of this Note shall cease and terminate, excepting only the right
to receive certificates for such shares of Common Stock and to any remedies provided herein or otherwise available at law or in
equity to such Holder because of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of this Note. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if a Holder has not received certificates for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th) business day after the expiration
of the Deadline with respect to a conversion of any portion of this Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects
to retain its status as a holder of Common Stock by so notifying the Borrower) the Holder shall regain the rights of a Holder of
this Note with respect to such unconverted portions of this Note and the Borrower shall, as soon as practicable, return such unconverted
Note to the Holder or, if the Note has not been surrendered, adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note has not
been converted. In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right
to receive Conversion Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such Conversion Default and any
subsequent Conversion Default and (ii) the right to have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent conversions determined
in accordance with Section 1.3) for the Borrower s failure to convert this Note.  

  1.9.                
   Prepayment . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note, at any
time during the period beginning on the Issue Date the Borrower shall have the right, exercisable on not less than three (3) Trading
Days prior written notice to the Holder of the Note to prepay the outstanding Note (principal and accrued interest), in full, in
accordance with this Section 1.9. Any notice of prepayment hereunder (an  Optional Prepayment Notice ) shall be delivered
to the Holder of the Note at its registered addresses and shall state: (1) that the Borrower is exercising its right to prepay
the Note, and (2) the date of prepayment which shall be not more than three (3) Trading Days from the date of the Optional Prepayment
Notice. On the date fixed for prepayment (the  Optional Prepayment Date ), the Borrower shall make payment of the Optional
Prepayment Amount (as defined below) to or upon the order of the Holder as specified by the Holder in writing to the Borrower at
least one (1) business day prior to the Optional Prepayment Date. If the Borrower exercises its right to prepay the Note, the Borrower  

12   

shall make payment to the Holder
of an amount in cash (the  Optional Prepayment Amount ) equal to the Applicable Premium (as defined below) multiplied
by the sum of: (w) the then outstanding principal amount of this Note  plus  (x) accrued and unpaid interest on
the unpaid principal amount of this Note to the Optional Prepayment Date  plus  (y) Default Interest, if any, on
the amounts referred to in clauses (w) and (x)  plus  (z) any amounts owed to the Holder pursuant to Sections 1.2
and 1.4(g) hereof. If the Borrower delivers an Optional Prepayment Notice and fails to pay the Optional Prepayment Amount due to
the Holder of the Note within two (2) business days following the Optional Prepayment Date, the Borrower shall forever forfeit
its right to prepay the Note pursuant to this Section 1.9. 

After the expiration of one hundred
eighty (180) following the date of the Note, the Borrower shall have no right of prepayment.

   Restriction on Stock Repurchases . So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation
under this Note, the Borrower shall not without the Holder s written consent redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (whether
for cash or in exchange for property or other securities or otherwise) in any one transaction or series of related transactions
any shares of capital stock of the Borrower or any warrants, rights or options to purchase or acquire any such shares.  

  2.2.                
   Sale of Assets . So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation under this Note,

use of the proceeds of disposition.     

  2.3.                
   Prohibition on Equity Line of Credit . Without prior written approval from Holder, from

Equity Line of Credit or similar agreement, nor exercise of any of its rights under any Equity Line of Credit entered into as of
the Closing Date other than an Equity Line of Credit entered into with the Borrower or its affiliates, (an  Equity Line of
Credit ). For purposes hereof,  Equity Line of Credit  shall include any transaction involving a written agreement
between the Company and an investor or underwriter whereby the Company has the right to  put  its securities to the
investor or underwriter over an agreed period  

13

  ARTICLE
III.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT 

  If any
of the following events of default (each, an  Event of Default ) shall occur: 

  3.1.                
   Failure to Pay Principal or Interest . The Borrower fails to pay the principal
hereof or interest thereon when due on this Note, whether at maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise.  

  3.2.                
   Conversion and the Shares . The Borrower fails to issue shares of Common Stock
to the Holder (or announces or threatens in writing that it will not honor its obligation to do so) upon exercise by the Holder
of the conversion rights of the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Note, fails to transfer or cause its transfer
agent to transfer (issue) (electronically or in certificated form) any certificate for shares of Common Stock issued to the Holder
upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note as and when required by this Note, the Borrower directs its transfer agent
not to transfer or delays, impairs, and/or hinders its transfer agent in transferring (or issuing) (electronically or in certificated
form) any certificate for shares of Common Stock to be issued to the Holder upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note
as and when required by this Note, or fails to remove (or directs its transfer agent not to remove or impairs, delays, and/or hinders

any certificate for any shares of Common Stock issued to the Holder upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to this Note as and
when required by this Note (or makes any written announcement, statement or threat that it does not intend to honor the obligations

of this Note to the date of payment (the  Mandatory Prepayment Date )  plus  (y) Default Interest, if

Sections 1.3 and 1.4(g) hereof (the then outstanding principal amount of this Note to the date of payment  plus  the
amounts referred to in clauses (x), (y) and (z) shall collectively be known as the  Default Sum ) or (ii) the  parity
value  of the Default Sum to be prepaid, where parity value means (a) the highest number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon conversion of or otherwise pursuant to such Default Sum in accordance with Article I, treating the Trading Day immediately
preceding the Mandatory Prepayment Date as the  Conversion Date  for purposes of determining the lowest applicable
Conversion Price, unless the Default Event arises as a result of a breach in respect of a specific Conversion Date in which case
such Conversion Date shall be the Conversion Date),  multiplied by  (b) the highest Closing Price for the Common
Stock during the period beginning on the date of first occurrence of the Event of Default and ending one day prior to the Mandatory

Default Amount within five (5) business days of written notice that such amount is due and payable, then the Holder shall have
the right at any time, so long as the Borrower remains in default (and so long and to the extent that there are sufficient authorized
shares), to require the Borrower, upon written notice, to immediately issue, in lieu of the Default Amount, the number of shares
of Common Stock of the Borrower equal to the Default Amount divided by the Conversion Price which shall be so that the Variable
Conversion Price equals 40% (discount of 60%)

  4.1.                
   Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver . No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in
the exercise of any power, right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of any such power, right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privileges. All
rights and remedies existing hereunder are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available.

the date of mailing by express courier service, fully prepaid, addressed to such address, or upon actual receipt of such mailing,
whichever shall first occur.  The addresses for such communications shall be: If to the Borrower, to: [ENTER NAME ADDRESS] With
a copy by fax only to (which copy shall not constitute notice): If to the Holder: With a copy by fax only to (which copy shall
not constitute notice):   

  4.3.                
   Amendments . This Note and any provision hereof may only be amended by an instrument
in writing signed by the Borrower and the Holder. The term  Note  and all reference thereto, as used throughout this
instrument, shall mean this instrument (and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) as originally executed,
or if later amended or supplemented, then as so amended or supplemented.  

  4.4.                
   Assignability . This Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and
assigns, and shall inure to be the benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns. Each transferee of this Note must be an
 accredited investor  (as defined in Rule 501(a) of the 1933 Act). Notwithstanding anything in this Note to the contrary,
this Note may be pledged as collateral in connection with a  bona   fide  margin account or other lending
arrangement.  

  4.5.                
   Cost of Collection . If default is made in the payment of this Note, the Borrower shall
pay the Holder hereof costs of collection, including reasonable attorneys  fees.  

  4.6.                
   Governing Law .  This Note shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without regard to conflicts of laws principles that would
result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction.  Any action brought by either party against
the other concerning the transactions contemplated by this Agreement must be brought only in the civil or state courts of
California or in the federal courts located in Los Angeles County.  Both parties and the individual signing this Agreement
on behalf of the Borrower agree to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts.  The prevailing party shall be entitled
to recover from the other party its reasonable attorney s fees and costs.  In the event that any provision of this
Note is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to
the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision
which may prove invalid or unenforceable under any law shall not affect the validity or unenforceability of any other provision
of this Note. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed   

18   

or
operate to preclude the Holder from bringing suit or taking other legal action against the Borrower in any other jurisdiction to
collect on the Borrower s obligations to Holder, to realize on any collateral or any other security for such obligations,
or to enforce a judgment or other decision in favor of the Holder.   This Note shall be deemed an unconditional obligation
of Borrower for the payment of money and, without limitation to any other remedies of Holder, may be enforced against Borrower
by summary proceeding pursuant to any rule or statute in the jurisdiction where enforcement is sought.  For purposes
of such rule or statute, any other document or agreement to which Holder and Borrower are parties or which Borrower delivered to
Holder, which may be convenient or necessary to determine Holder s rights hereunder or Borrower s obligations to Holder
are deemed a part of this Note, whether or not such other document or agreement was delivered together herewith or was executed
apart from this Note.   

  4.7.                
   Certain Amounts . Whenever pursuant to this Note the Borrower is required to pay an
amount in excess of the outstanding principal amount (or the portion thereof required to be paid at that time) plus accrued and
unpaid interest plus Default Interest on such interest, the Borrower and the Holder agree that the actual damages to the Holder
from the receipt of cash payment on this Note may be difficult to determine and the amount to be so paid by the Borrower represents
stipulated damages and not a penalty and is intended to compensate the Holder in part for loss of the opportunity to convert this
Note and to earn a return from the sale of shares of Common Stock acquired upon conversion of this Note at a price in excess of
the price paid for such shares pursuant to this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree that such amount of stipulated damages
is not plainly disproportionate to the possible loss to the Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to
convert this Note into shares of Common Stock.  

  4.8.                
   Disclosure . Upon receipt or delivery by the Company of any
notice in accordance with the terms of this Note, unless the Company has in good faith determined that the matters relating to
such notice do not constitute material, non-public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company
shall within one (1) Trading Day after any such receipt or delivery, publicly disclose such material, non-public information on
a Current Report on Form 8-K or otherwise. In the event that the Company believes that a notice contains material, non-public information
relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the Company so shall indicate to such Holder contemporaneously with delivery
of such notice, and in the absence of any such indication, the Holder shall be allowed to presume that all matters relating to
such notice do not constitute material, non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries.  

  4.9.                
   Purchase Agreement . By its acceptance of this Note, each party agrees to be bound by
the applicable terms of the Purchase Agreement.  

  4.10.            
   Notice of Corporate Events . Except as otherwise provided below, the Holder of this
Note shall have no rights as a Holder of Common Stock unless and only to the extent that it converts this Note into Common Stock.
The Borrower shall provide the Holder with prior notification of any meeting of the Borrower s shareholders (and copies of
proxy materials and other information sent to shareholders). In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of its shareholders
for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to receive  

19   

payment of any dividend or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, reclassification
or recapitalization) any share of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or for the purpose
of determining shareholders who are entitled to vote in connection with any proposed sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Borrower or any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Borrower, the Borrower shall mail
a notice to the Holder, at least twenty (20) days prior to the record date specified therein (or thirty (30) days prior to the
consummation of the transaction or event, whichever is earlier), of the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose
of such dividend, distribution, right or other event, and a brief statement regarding the amount and character of such dividend,
distribution, right or other event to the extent known at such time. The Borrower shall make a public announcement of any event
requiring notification to the Holder hereunder substantially simultaneously with the notification to the Holder in accordance with
the terms of this Section 4.9. 

  4.11.            
   Remedies . The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder
will cause irreparable harm to the Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly,
the Borrower acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees,
in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder shall be entitled,
in addition to all other available remedies at law or in equity, and in addition to the penalties assessable herein, to an injunction
or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof,
without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.  

  4.12.            
  Unconditional Obligation; No Offset.   Borrower
acknowledges that this Note is an unconditional, valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Borrower not subject to offset, deduction
or counterclaim of any kind. Borrower hereby waives any rights of offset it now has or may have hereafter against Lender, its successors
and assigns, and agrees to make the payments or conversions called for herein in accordance with the terms of this Note.  

  4.13.            
   Severability . If any provision of this Note is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
balance of this Note shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless
remain applicable to all other persons and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest
due hereunder shall violate applicable laws governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically
be lowered to equal the maximum permitted rate of interest. The Borrower covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that
it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension
or usury law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Borrower from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest
on this Note as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants
or the performance of this indenture, and the Borrower (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefits
or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impeded the execution
of any power herein granted to the Holder, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such as though no such law has been
enacted

                                         that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s
                                         fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
                                         or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
                                         over financial reporting; and

   Rule
13a-14(a)/15d-14(a) Certification of Chief Financial Officer  

I,
William Bossung, certify that:  

1.    I
                                         have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of Grey Cloak Tech Inc.;    

  Based
on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary
to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect
to the period covered by this report;  

  Based
on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material
respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented
in this report;  

  The
registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exhibit Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:  

(a)    Designed
                                         such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures
                                         to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to
                                         the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
                                         within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;    

(b)    Designed
                                         such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over
                                         financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance
                                         regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements
                                         for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;    

(c)    Evaluated
                                         the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented
                                         in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and
                                         procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;
                                         and    

(d)    Disclosed
                                         in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting
                                         that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s
                                         fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected,
                                         or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control
                                         over financial reporting; and    

  The
registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over
financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or
persons performing the equivalent functions):  

(a)    All
                                         significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
                                         control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
                                         registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information;
                                         and    

(b)    Any
                                         fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
                                         a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting .
