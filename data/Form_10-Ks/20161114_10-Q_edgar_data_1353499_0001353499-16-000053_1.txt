Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Forward-looking statements discuss matters that are not historical
facts. Because they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking statements may include words such as  anticipate, 
 believe,   estimate,   intend,   could,   should,   would, 
 may,   seek,   plan,   might,   will,   expect,   predict, 
 project,   forecast,   potential,   continue  negatives thereof or similar expressions.
Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, are based on various underlying assumptions and current expectations
about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that
may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievement to be materially different from the results of operations
or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.  

We
cannot predict all of the risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that
the results or conditions described in such statements or that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume
any responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements
are found at various places throughout this Report and include information concerning possible or assumed future results of our
operations, including statements about potential acquisition or merger targets; business strategies; future cash flows; financing
plans; plans and objectives of management; any other statements regarding future acquisitions, future cash needs, future operations,
business plans and future financial results, and any other statements that are not historical facts.  

These
forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are
subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results
to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. In light of these risks, uncertainties
and assumptions, the events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or
at a different time than we have described. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements,
which speak only as of the date of this Report. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters
addressed in this Report and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by
the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this Report.  

Except
to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result
of new information, future events, a change in events, conditions, circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or
otherwise.

OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2016   

   (UNAUDITED)   

NOTE
1           SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ORGANIZATION   

(A)
Organization and Basis of Presentation    

Max
Sound Corporation (the  Company ) was incorporated in Delaware on December 9, 2005, under the name 43010, Inc. The Company
business operations are focused primarily on developing and launching audio technology software.  

Effective
March 1, 2011, the Company filed with the State of Delaware a Certificate of Amendment of Certificate of Incorporation changing
our name from So Act Network, Inc. to Max Sound Corporation.  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in The United States of America and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission applicable to interim
financial information and with instructions to Form 10Q and Articles of Regulations S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all
the information necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position and results of operations.  

It
is management's opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) have been made
which are necessary for a fair financial statements presentation. The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative
of the results to be expected for the year.  

These
unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and
related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 30,
2015.  

On
August 9, 2016 the Company has moved a level down from OTCQB to OTC Pink Current Information where it is within the continued
standards and pricing requirements as found in Section 2 of the OTCQB Eligibility Standards .  The company s services,
which remain active and are paid current with OTC Markets through the end of 2016, may re-apply at any time after a price increase
to meet all of the OTCQB Eligibility Standards to be moved back to the higher OTCQB marketplace.   

(B)
Use of Estimates    

In
preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  

(C)
Cash and Cash Equivalents    

For
purposes of the cash flow statements, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no cash
equivalents.  

(D)
Property and Equipment    

Property
and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense
as incurred. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of three to five years.  

(E)
Research and Development    

The
Company has adopted the provisions of FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 350,  Intangibles - Goodwill   Other  ( ASC
Topic 350 ) .  Costs incurred in the planning stage of a website are expensed as research and development while costs
incurred in the development stage are capitalized and amortized over the life of the asset, estimated to be three years. Expenses
subsequent to the launch have been expensed as website development expenses.  

(F)
Concentration of Credit Risk    

The
Company at times has cash in banks in excess of FDIC insurance limits. The Company had $0 in excess of FDIC insurance limits as
of September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

(G)
Revenue Recognition    

The
Company recognized revenue on arrangements in accordance with FASB Codification Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition  ( ASC
Topic 605 ). Under ASC Topic 605, revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed and determinable, persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, the service is performed and collectability of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. The Company
has not yet commenced revenue generating activities.  

(H)
Inventories    

Inventory
consists primarily of finished goods and is valued at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using the weighted average
method and average cost is recomputed after each inventory purchase or sale. Inventory is periodically reviewed in order to identify
obsolete or damaged inventory and impaired values. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the inventory was impaired and valued
at $0. The Company had no inventory as of September 30, 2016.  

(I)
Identifiable Intangible Assets    

ASC
350 prescribes a two-step process for impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives, which is performed
annually, as well as when an event triggering impairment may have occurred. ASC 350 also allows preparers to qualitatively assess
goodwill impairment through a screening process, which would permit companies to forgo Step 1 of their annual goodwill impairment
process. This qualitative screening process will hereinafter be referred to as  Step 0 . Goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have an indefinite life are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or earlier when events or changes in circumstances
suggest the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. The Company has elected to perform its annual assessment on $16,796,237
of intangible assets. For the year ended December 31, 2015, $15,703,616 impairment loss has been recorded due to a change in business
model, this being significantly impacted by the impairment of Liquid Spins assets, as digital music sales are no longer relevant
in today s market for the following assets:  

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $804,362 and $869,581, respectively, of costs related to registering a trademark
and acquiring technology rights [audio technology known as Max Audio Technology (MAXD)] have been capitalized. It has been determined
that the trademark and technology rights have an indefinite useful life and are not subject to amortization. However, the trademark
and technology rights will be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. As a result
of this review, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $6,630,419 that is recorded as impairment loss on intangible asset
for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

On
November 15, 2012, the Company acquired the rights to assets and audio technology known as Liquid Spins, Inc. through a
share exchange, whereby the Company issued 24,752,475 shares of common stock for their rights in Liquid Spins technology. As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $0 and $0, respectively, of costs related to this intangible remain capitalized.
The technology was placed in service on August 23, 2013 with a useful life of 10 years. During 2015, the Company reviewed the
intangible asset for impairment and determined that certain items had been impaired due to obsolescence. During 2015 fiscal
year, a $7,372,562 impairment loss was recorded against certain Distribution Rights acquired during 2012 fiscal
year.  

On
May 19, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with VSL Communications to acquire the rights to intellectual property
titled  Optimized Data Transmission System and Method  ( ODT ) through a cash payment of $500,000 in
addition to a share issuance, whereby the Company issued 10,000,000 shares of common stock, valued at $1,000,000
($0.10/share). In exchange, the Company received a perpetual, exclusive, worldwide license to the ODT technology for all
fields of use. In addition, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock, valued at $120,000 ($0.12/share), as
compensation for the introduction and identification of a seller based on the agreement dated April 10, 2014. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $173,742 and $187,830, respectively, of costs related to the  ODT  intangible
asset remains capitalized. The technology will be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment
indicators arise. As a result of this review, the Company recorded an impairment loss of $1,432,170 that is recorded as
impairment loss on intangible asset for the year ended December 31, 2015. In connection with this agreement, the Company is
obligated to make an additional five (5) payments totaling $1,000,000 to be made every 30 days, with the thirty (30) day
periods to be waived if fund raising occurs on an anticipated faster time line. The payments of additional cash are
contingent on the following funding criteria:  

The
    Company shall pay set increments of cash based on a percentage of gross funds received through funds raised.   

The
    Company shall pay 20% of such monies as soon as they are received.   

In
connection with the acquisition agreements entered on May 19, 2014 to acquire  Optimized Data Transmission System and Method 
( ODT ), we recorded a liability and expensed $1,096,501 royalty cost for funds raised through September 30, 2016

The
Company shall act as the exclusive agent to facilitate and negotiate any opportunities on behalf of ODT to Companies, Organizations
and other qualified entities. Upon any closing, ODT shall receive 50% of gross dollars and the Company shall receive the other
50% at the time of a completion of any transaction opportunity, including legal settlements after subtracting applicable contingent
legal fees. The term of the agreement is for the life of the acquired intellectual property. As a result of this review, the Company
recorded an impairment loss of $6,630,419 on intangible asset during the year ended December 31, 2015  

On
August 11, 2014, the Company and VSL simultaneously filed trade secret and patent infringement actions against Google, Inc. and
its subsidiaries, YouTube, LLC and On2 Technologies, Inc., relating to proprietary and patented technology owned by Vedanti Systems
Limited, a subsidiary of VSL.  The patent infringement complaint was brought in U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware
and the trade secret suit was filed in Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara.  The lawsuits contend that, in
2010, while Google was in discussions with Vedanti about the possibility of acquiring Vedanti's patented digital video streaming
techniques and other proprietary methods, Google gained access to and received technical guidance regarding Vedanti s proprietary
codec, a computer program capable of encoding and decoding a digital data stream or signal.  The complaints allege that soon
after the two companies initiated negotiations, Google began implementing Vedanti's technology into its own WebM/VP8 video codec
without informing Vedanti, and without compensating Vedanti for its use.  Plaintiffs are seeking a permanent injunction against
Google, compensatory damages, as well as treble damages. As exclusive agent to VSL to enforce all rights with respect to the subject
technology, the Company has hired Grant   Eisenhofer, PA to represent the Company and VSL in the suits. On November 24, 2015
the District Court entered an order granting the Google defendants  motion to dismiss. The Company timely filed its notice
of appeal with the appeals court on February 22, 2016. The two issues on appeal are, (i) whether the district court erred by granting
the Google defendants  motion to dismiss the Company s lawsuit on the ground that the Company lacked standing to sue
the Google defendants for infringement of the 339 patent, and (ii) whether the district court erred by denying the Company s
motion for leave to amend the complaint and add as a party VSL, a former licensee of the 339 patent to cure any defect in prudential
standing to the extent VSL is a necessary party. These cases will be vigorously prosecuted and the Company believes it has a good
likelihood of success.   

On
May 22, 2014, the Company entered into a five (5) year agreement to acquire the rights to intellectual property titled  Engineered
Architecture  ( EA Technology ) through a cash payment of $50,000 in addition to a share issuance, whereby the
Company issued 4,000,000 shares of common stock, valued at $394,000 ($0.0985/share). In exchange, the Company received for the
term of the agreement, the exclusive worldwide right to use the EA Technology. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
$29,901 and $35,178, respectively of costs related to this intangible remains capitalized. The technology will be reviewed for
impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. As a result of this review, the Company recorded an impairment
loss of $268,223 on intangible asset for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

In
connection with this agreement, the Company is obligated to make an additional five (5) payments totaling $500,000 to be made
every 30 days, with the thirty (30) day periods to be waived if fund raising occurs on an anticipated faster time line. The payments
of additional cash are contingent on the following funding criteria:  

The
    Company shall pay set increments of cash based on a percentage of gross funds received through funds raised.   

The
    Company shall pay 10% of such monies as soon as they are received.   

In
connection with funds raised through September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a liability and expensed $548,255 as royalty cost,
related to the 10% fee, as of September 30, 2016, $40,000 has been paid. The remaining liability as of September 30, 2016, is
$528,423 and is included in accounts payable.  

The
Company shall act as the exclusive agent to facilitate and negotiate any opportunities on behalf of EA Technology to Companies,
Organizations and other qualified entities. Upon any closing, EA shall receive 50% of gross dollars and the Company shall receive
the other 50% at the time of a completion of any transaction opportunity, including legal settlements after subtracting applicable
contingent legal fees. In the event the Company sublicenses EA to other entities, profits shall be split evenly 50%/50%.  

(J)
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangible Assets with Definite Life    

The
Company accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets.  ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets, such as technology rights, be reviewed for impairment
annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an asset may no longer
be appropriate. The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating the future net cash flows
expected to result from the asset, including eventual disposition. If the future net cash flows are less than the carrying value
of the asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset s carrying value and fair value or
disposable value. The Company recorded $0, $0 and $15,703,617 in impairment of the intangible asset for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively (See Note 1J).  

(K)
Loss Per Share    

In
accordance with accounting guidance now codified as FASB ASC Topic 260,   Earnings per Share,   Basic earnings
(loss) per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted EPS
gives effect to all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock options or warrants,
using the treasury stock method (by using the average stock price for the period to determine the number of shares assumed to
be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants), and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted
method. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential of shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive. Because of the
Company s net losses, the effects of stock warrants and stock options would be anti-dilutive and accordingly, is excluded
from the computation of earnings per share.  

The
computation of basic and diluted loss per share for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 excludes the common stock equivalents
of the following potentially dilutive securities because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive:  

(L)
Income Taxes    

The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic 740-10-25 ( ASC 740-10-25 ) Income Taxes. Under ASC
740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between
the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of
a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.  

The
Company's federal income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by the IRS for the years prior to 2011, and the related
state income tax returns are no longer subject to examination by state authorities for the years prior to 2010.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ( ASU 2015-03 ), which changes the presentation
of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a
direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported
as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.
The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating
the impact of adoption of ASU 2015-03 on its balance sheets.  

All
other newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.  

(O)
Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

The
carrying amounts on the Company s financial instruments including accounts payable, derivative liability, convertible note
payable, and note payable, approximate fair value due to the relatively short period to maturity for these instruments.  

We
adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities (ASC 820). The adoption did not have a material
impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for
measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather
applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to
measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable
market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the
service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:  

Level
1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

  Level
2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar
assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not
active.  

  Level
3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed
by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.  

The
following are the major categories of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis: as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, using quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities (Level 1); significant other observable inputs (Level
2); and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):  

(P)
Stock-Based Compensation    

In
December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. Under FASB Accounting
Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements
based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees
are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based
awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans. As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant
at their fair value. Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option grant.
The Company applies this statement prospectively.  

Equity
instruments ( instruments ) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments,
as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718. FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505, Equity Based Payments
to Non-Employees defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments. In general, the measurement date is
when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete
or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts
and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  

(Q)
Reclassification    

Certain
amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no
impact on the Company's net loss or cash flows.  

(R)
Derivative Financial Instruments    

Fair
value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity
instruments, and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the Company
uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines if the convertible
debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature requiring measurement.
If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue its evaluation process of these instruments
as derivative financial instruments.  

Once
determined, derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease
in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives. In addition, the fair
value of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants, are also valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.   

(S)
Original Issue Discount    

For
certain convertible debt issued, the Company provides the debt holder with an original issue discount. The original issue discount
is recorded to debt discount, reducing the face amount of the note and is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt.  

(T)
Debt Issue Costs and Debt Discount    

The
Company may pay debt issue costs, and record debt discounts in connection with raising funds through the issuance of convertible
debt. These costs are amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt. If a conversion of the underlying debt occurs,
a proportionate share of the unamortized amounts is immediately expensed.

Licensing   Distribution    

On
June 20, 2015, the Company entered into a license agreement with Santok LTD of United Kingdom ( Santok). The term of
the agreement is three years. Santok will pay the Company a royalty fee of $1.50 for each licensed product. Santok guarantees
to the Company a minimum total of 150,000 cumulative licensed product installation with a minimum total guaranteed value of $225,000
over the three years of the agreement. If the total royalty paid is less than the guaranteed value, Santok will pay the difference.  

On
July 13, 2015, the Company entered into a license agreement with Luna Mobile, Inc. of United States ( Luna). The term of
the agreement is three years. Luna will pay the Company a royalty fee of $1.50 for each licensed product manufactured and
sold. As of September 30, 2016 Luna Mobile continues to seek to distribute its products.  

NOTE 2           GOING
CONCERN    

As
reflected in the accompanying condensed unaudited financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $9,441,874 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, has an accumulated deficit of $72,736,906 as of September 30, 2016, and has negative cash flow
from operations of $1,488,470 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

As
the Company continues to incur losses, transition to profitability is dependent upon the successful commercialization of its products
and achieving a level of revenues adequate to support the Company s cost structure.  

The
Company may never achieve profitability, and unless and until it does, the Company will continue to need to raise additional cash.
Management intends to fund future operations through additional private or public debt or equity offerings. Based on the Company s
operating plan, existing working capital at December 31, 2015 was not sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund planned
operations through December 31, 2016 without additional sources of cash. The Company continues to explore various financing alternatives,
including debt and equity financings and strategic partnerships, as well as trying to generate revenue. However, at this time,
the Company has no commitments to obtain any additional funds, and there can be no assurance such funds will be available on acceptable
terms or at all. If the Company is unable to obtain additional funding and improve its operations, the Company s financial
condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected and the Company may not be able to continue operations.
This raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The accompanying financial
statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern and do not include adjustments that might
result fromthe outcome of this uncertainty.

features in these notes and warrants as a derivative liability due to management s assessment that the Company may not have
sufficient authorized number of shares of common stock required to net-share settle or due to the existence of a ratchet due to
an anti-dilution provision. See Note 4 regarding accounting for derivative liabilities.

LIABILITIES   

The
Company identified conversion features embedded within convertible debt issued in 2016 and 2015 and warrants issued in 2016 and

NOTE 8       LITIGATION   

From
time to time, the Company has become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of
business. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise
from time to time that may harm its business.  

On
January 21, 2015, the Company filed a patent infringement action against Netflix Inc., Netflix Luxembourg S.a.r.l. and Netflix
International B.V. with the District Court of Mannheim, Germany. The asserted patent is the same patent as in the German proceedings
against Google Inc. and its subsidiaries. The Complaint alleges that Netflix Inc. and its subsidiaries are offering and transmitting
video streams to German customers as part of their video-on-demand business model; the videos being encoded and transmitted in
a manner claimed and protected by the patent. The Company primarily seeks a permanent injunction against the Defendants, plus
damages and information regarding past infringements. The Company, on or around December 2015 upon advice of counsel, decided
withdraw the litigation prior to oral argument, which withdrawal is without prejudice to re-file the lawsuit in the future.  

The
Company intends to vigorously prosecute these various patent infringement litigations. The Company believes it has a good likelihood
of success associated with these patent infringement lawsuits. However, no assurance can be given by the Company as to the ultimate
outcome of these actions or its effect on the Company. The law firm is prosecuting this action on a pure contingency fee basis.  

On
January 26, 2015, the Company was named as a defendant in an action filed in the Superior Court for the State of California and
the County of Los Angeles captioned Bibicoff Family Trust v. Max Sound Corporation (Case No. SC123679). In the complaint the plaintiff
alleges a cause of action for breach of contract associated with the non-payment by the Company for certain services plaintiff
agreed to provide to the Company. The Company interposed a cross-complaint against plaintiffs averring causes of action for breach
of contract, fraud, and negligent misrepresentation by defendants with respect to defendants  fraudulent and intentional
undisclosed inability to perform the services that plaintiffs  agreed to perform that are the subject of this dispute. The
parties recently participated in mediation and have arrived successfully at a settlement and resolution of the matter. The Company
agreed in connection with the settlement to pay Bibicoff Trust $100,000 over a 13 month installment period commencing March 10,
2016, with the caveat that such settlement amount will be reduced to $93,000 in the event the Company pays $20,000 on or before
March 10, 2016, which the Company successfully achieved thus reducing the settlement amount to $93,000.

August 11, 2014, the Company and VSL simultaneously filed trade secret and patent infringement actions against Google, Inc., and
its subsidiaries YouTube, LLC, and On2 Technologies, Inc., relating to proprietary and patented technology owned by Vedanti Systems
Limited ( Vedanti ), a subsidiary of VSL.  The patent infringement complaint was originally filed in the U.S.
District Court for the District of Delaware; the trade secret suit was filed in Superior Court of California, County of Santa
Clara.  On September 30, 2014, the Company filed notices of voluntary dismissal without prejudice as to both lawsuits. On
October 1, 2014, the Company amended the patent complaint and filed it in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
California. In this patent lawsuit, the Company contends that, in 2010, while Google was in discussions with Vedanti about the
possibility of acquiring Vedanti's patented digital video streaming techniques and other proprietary methods, Google gained access
to and received technical guidance regarding Vedanti s proprietary codec, a computer program capable of encoding and decoding
a digital data stream or signal.  The lawsuit further alleges that soon after Google and Vedanti initiated negotiations,
Google willfully infringed Vedanti's patent by incorporating Vedanti's patented technology into Google's own VP8, VP9, WebM, YouTube,
Google Adsense, Google Play, Google TV, Chromebook, Google Drive, Google Chromecast, Google Play-per-view, Google Glasses, Google+,
Google s Simplify, Google Maps, and Google Earth, without compensating Vedanti for such use.  On May 13, 2015
Google's  motion to dismiss  was denied by the Northern District of California court in a seven page order, stating
that Max Sound had sufficiently alleged the existence and validity of the '339 Patent.  However, on November 24, 2015, the
court granted a second motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on the defendants  argument that
the agreements between the Company and VSL/Vedanti did not clearly give the Company standing to enforce the patent rights. 
The Company appealed that decision on February 22, 2016, and the appeal is currently pending before the Federal Circuit Court
of Appeals.  The two issues on appeal are, (i) whether the district court erred by granting the Google defendants 
motion to dismiss the Company s lawsuit on the ground that the Company lacked standing to sue the Google defendants for
infringement of the 339 patent, and (ii) whether the district court erred by denying the Company s motion for leave to amend
the complaint and add as a party VSL, a former licensee of the 339 patent to cure any defect in prudential standing to the extent
VSL is a necessary party.  

In
connection with the dismissal of the aforementioned litigation, the Company initiated an arbitration against VSL Communications,
Ltd., Vedanti Systems, Ltd., Constance Nash, Robert Newell and eTech Investments as respondents before the American
Arbitration Association for breach of contract, fraud, and other causes of action. Subsequently, the Company is pursuing in arbitration
claims against VSL to enforce the agreement and to compel VSL to comply with the agreement s terms and conditions that inter
alia VSL must fully cooperate with the Company to cure any issues the Court raised with standing to pursue the claims. This arbitration
is still ongoing.  

On
April 22, 2016, Vedanti filed a lawsuit against the Company in the Northern District of California seeking to avoid participation
in the aforementioned arbitration.  This lawsuit is ongoing.  

On
December 5, 2014, the Company, along with renowned architect Eli Attia, filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of California, County
of Santa Clara, against Google, its co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page, Google s spinoff company Flux Factory, and senior
executives of Flux. Plaintiffs  allege misappropriation of trade secrets, breach of contract and other contract-related
claims, breach of confidence, slander of title, violation of California s Unfair Competition Law (California Business and
Professionals Code    17200 et seq.), and fraud, and also a claim for declaratory relief. The lawsuit contends that
Google and the other Defendants stole Mr. Attia s trade secrets, proprietary information, and know-how regarding a revolutionary
architecture design and building process that he alone had invented, known as Engineered Architecture. Defendants are alleged
to have engaged Mr. Attia in 2010 and 2011 to translate his architectural technology into software for a proof of concept, with
the goal of determining at that point whether to continue with full-scale development with Mr. Attia. Instead, the lawsuit claims
that once Mr. Attia had disclosed the trade secrets and proprietary information Defendants needed to bring the technology to market,
they severed ties with Mr. Attia, and continued to use his technology without a license and without compensation, in order to
bring the technology to market themselves. Plaintiffs seek a permanent injunction against Google, damages (including punitive
damages), and restitution. As exclusive agent to Eli Attia to enforce all rights with respect to the subject technology, the Company
has retained Buether Joe   Carpenter LLC to represent the Company in the suit, on a contingency fee basis. The case will be
vigorously prosecuted, and the Company believes it has a good likelihood of success.  Defendants have filed multiple demurrers to
the complaint, and the Court has issued orders allowing the case to proceed.  Defendants filed another demurrer on March
17, 2016, which was denied by the Court on August 12, 2016.  The parties are expected to begin the discovery phase of the
litigation this winter.  

On
June 1, 2016, the Company was named as a defendant in an action filed in the Superior Court of the State of California, County
of Los Angeles   Central District, captioned Adli Law Group, PC v. Max Sound Corporation (Case No. BC621886). Plaintiff
alleges two causes of action for Breach of Contract and a cause of action for Common Counts, all arising out of the Company s
alleged failure to pay for Plaintiff s legal services. Despite the fact that the Company was never served with the Complaint,
default was entered against the Company. The Company has filed a Motion to Set Aside the Default. If the default is set aside,
the Company will respond to the Complaint with an Answer and Cross-Complaint for Breach of Contract, Professional Negligence,
Breach of Fiduciary Duty, Conversion, and Fraud.  

On
September 22, 2016, the Company filed an action in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Diego  
North County Regional Center, captioned Max Sound Corporation v. Globex Transfer, LLC (Case No. 37-2016-0003037-CU-MC-NC). The
Company requests injunctive relief and declaratory relief regarding the release of 13 million restricted shares of Company stock.
On September 26, 2016, the Court granted the Company a preliminary injunction, enjoining Defendant from releasing any restriction
of the subject shares without first obtaining the Company s consent, pending the outcome of the litigation.  

No
assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of these actions or their effect on the Company.

Overview   

Max
Sound Corporation ( we,   us,   our,  or the  Company ) was incorporated in the
State of Delaware on December 9, 2005 as 43010, Inc. to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited
to, locating and negotiating with a business entity for combination in the form of a merger, stock-for-stock exchange or stock-for-assets
exchange. On October 7, 2008, pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement, Mr. Greg Halpern purchased a total of 100,000
shares of our common stock from Michael Raleigh for an aggregate of $30,000 in cash. The total of 100,000 shares represents 100%
of our issued and outstanding common stock at the time of the transfer. As a result, Mr. Halpern became our sole shareholder.
As part of the acquisition, and pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, Michael Raleigh, our then President, CEO, CFO, and Chairman
resigned from all the positions he held in the company, and Mr. Halpern was appointed as our President, CEO CFO and Chairman.
The original business model was developed by Mr. Halpern in September of 2008 and began when he joined the Company on October
7, 2008. In October 2008, we became a development stage company focused on creating an Internet search engine and networking web
site.   

From
October 2008 until January 17, 2011, Mr. Halpern was our CEO, and during that time the Company was focused on developing their
Internet search engine and networking web site. In January of 2010, the Company launched their Internet search engine and
networking website.  In 2011, the Company decided to abandon its social networking website.  On May 11, 2010,
the Company acquired the worldwide rights, title, and interest to all fields of use for MAX-D.  

On
January 17, 2011, Mr. Halpern resigned as the Company s CEO and John Blaisure was appointed as CEO.  In February
of 2011, the Company elected to change its business operations and focus primarily on developing and launching the MAX-D technology.  Our
current website (www.maxsound.com) is used to showcase the MAX-D technology.  On March 8, 2011, the Company changed
its name to Max Sound Corporation, and its trading symbol on the OTC Bulletin Board to MAXD.  

MAX
Sound Corporation owns the worldwide rights to all fields of use to MAX-D HD Audio, which was invented by Lloyd Trammell, a top
sound designer and audio engineer who helped develop and sell the first working Surround Sound System to Hughes Aircraft.  Mr.
Trammell, also developed MIDI for Korg and owns five patents in dimensional sound processing.  We believe that MAX-D
is to Audio what High Definition is to Video.  MAX-D works by converting all audio files to their highest possible acoustically
perfect equivalent without increasing files size or bandwidth usage.  

On
May 22, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with architect Eli Attia giving MAXD the exclusive rights to sue violators
of Eli Attia s intellectual property rights. MAXD has since filed suit against Google, Inc., Flux Factory, and various executives
of these companies for misappropriation of trade secrets.  

No
later than June 20, 2014, MAXD entered into a representation agreement with VSL Communications, Inc., making MAXD the exclusive
agent to VSL to enforce all rights with respect to patented technology owned and controlled by VSL. In particular, the Company
announced that it had acquired a worldwide license and representation rights to a patented video and data technology  Optimized
Data Transmission System and Method  which enables end-user licensees to transport 100% of data bandwidth content in only
3% of the bandwidth with the identical lossless quality. Significantly, this represents thirty three times reduction associated
with transport cost and the time it takes for the video or digital content to be viewed by an end-user. As described more fully
in the Legal Proceedings Section, The Company has since filed suit against Google, Inc., YouTube, LLC, and On2 Technologies, Inc.,
alleging willful infringement of the patent.  

On
June 20, 2015, the Company entered into a license agreement with Santok LTD of United Kingdom ( Santok). The term of
the agreement is three years. Santok will pay the Company a royalty fee of $1.50 for each licensed product. Santok guarantees
to the Company a minimum total of 150,000 cumulative licensed product installation with a minimum total guaranteed value of $225,000
over the three years of the agreement. If the total royalty paid is less than the guaranteed value, Santok will pay the difference.  

On
July 13, 2015, the Company entered into a license agreement with Luna Mobile, Inc. of United States ( Luna). The term of
the agreement is three years. Luna will pay the Company a royalty fee of $1.50 for each licensed product manufactured and
sold.  

Plan of Operation   

The
Company believes that Max Sound HD Audio Technology is a game changer for several vertical markets whose demand will create revenue
opportunities in 2016.  

We
expect our financial requirements to increase with the additional expenses needed to market and promote the MAX-D HD Audio Technology.  We
plan to fund these additional expenses through financings and through loans from our stockholders and/or officers based on existing
lines of credit and we are also considering various private funding opportunities until such time that our revenue stream is adequate
enough to provide the necessary funds.   

Results of Operations   

The
following tables set forth key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, in dollars, and key components
of our revenue for the period indicated, in dollars.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

General
and Administrative Expenses: Our general and administrative expenses were $157,362 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and $611,463 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $454,101, or approximately 74%, as a result
of decrease in the general operation of the Company included decreasing personnel, product development and marketing of our Max
Sound Technology.  

Consulting
Fees:  Our consulting fees were $20,750 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $117,889 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $97,139, or approximately 82%. The Company has decreased the use of consultants
to assist the Company.  

Professional
Fees: Our professional fees were $57,909 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $653,340 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $595,431 or approximately 91%, as a result of ongoing litigation.  

Compensation:
Our compensation expenses were $198,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and $238,046 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $40,046, or approximately 17%, as a result of our expensing of monthly compensation
to our management and employees.  

Net
Loss: Our net loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,113,821. While the operational expenses in marketing
our Max Sound technology decreased from the same period of last year, the overall amount of our net loss substantially decreased
as a result of an decrease in the change in the fair value of embedded derivative liability associated with the convertible debt
and the impairment of the intangible asset.  

For
the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015  

General
and Administrative Expenses: Our general and administrative expenses were $899,267 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and $2,228,127 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $1,328,860, or approximately 60%, as a
result of decrease in the general operation of the Company included added personnel, product development and marketing of our
Max Sound Technology.  

Consulting
Fees:  Our consulting fees were $160,582 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $362,438 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $201,856, or approximately 56%. The Company has decreased the use of consultants
to assist the Company.  

Professional
Fees: Our professional fees were $287,662 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $990,617 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, representing a decrease of $702,955 or approximately 71%, as a result of ongoing litigation.  

Compensation:
Our compensation expenses were $608,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $707,346 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, representing a decrease of $99,346, or approximately 14%, as a result of our expensing of monthly compensation
to our management and employees.  

Net
Loss: Our net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $9,441,874. While the operational expenses in marketing
our Max Sound technology decreased from the same period of last year, the overall amount of our net loss substantially increased
as a result of an increase in the change in the fair value of embedded derivative liability associated with the convertible debt.  

Liquidity and Capital
Resources   

Revenues
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, were $0 and $0, respectively. We have an accumulated deficit of $72,736,906
for the period from December 9, 2005 (inception) to September 30, 2016, and have negative cash flow from operations of $1,488,470
or the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    

Our
financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of revenues
from our subscriber base and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have incurred losses from inception.
These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  

From
our inception through September 30, 2016, our primary source of funds has been the proceeds of private offerings of our common
stock, private financing, and loans from stockholders.  Our need to obtain capital from outside investors is expected
to continue until we are able to achieve profitable operations, if ever. There is no assurance that management will be successful
in fulfilling all or any elements of its plans.    

Below
is a summary of our capital-raising activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company issued convertible notes totaling $2,195,547 and $5,390,789,
respectively.  

Loans and Advances   

We
have entered into three Credit Line Agreements with Greg Halpern.  The first two were for $100,000 each and matured
and expired in 2011.  The third Credit Line Agreement issued by Mr. Halpern in March 2010 is for an additional $500,000
and matured and expired in 2012.  All three agreements accrue interest at the prime rate as of the date of issuance.  The
prime rate of interest is the rate of interest that major banks charge their most creditworthy customers.  For the purposes
of these agreements, we shall determine the prime rate by using the prime rate reported by the Wall Street Journal on the date
funds are extended to the Company.  Based on the prime rate as of the date of issuance, the prime rate shall be 3.25%.
On September 26, 2013, we entered into a Credit Line Agreement with Mr. Halpern for $1,000,000 that will mature and expire on
or before the second anniversary of September 26, 2015.  Interest will accrue on each advance at an annual rate of 4%.
As of December 31, 2013, the Company owed $0 in principal and $0 in accrued interest related to these loans and lines of credit.  We
believe that the $1,000,000 line of credit issued will not be sufficient to cover the additional expense arising from maintenance
of our regulatory filings with the SEC, and the marketing of our technology over the next twelve months, thus the Company will
continue to pursue additional financing and/or additional funding in 2016 to continue marketing the Max Sound HD Audio Technology
aggressively to Multi-Media Industry Users of Audio and Audio with Video products.   

In
2015, the Company has received from Mr. Halpern additional net advances on the established lines of credit in the amount of $264,000
of which it has repaid $536,000.  As of September 30, 2016, the balance including accrued interest on the line of credit
is $473.  This further demonstrates our Chairman s ongoing commitment to continue financing the Company s
needs.  While the Company expects to have ongoing needs for additional financing, the amount of those needs are not
clearly established as the Company moves forward.  

During
the year ended December 31, 2015, the principal stockholder was repaid $536,000.  As of December 31, 2015, the line
of credit balance including accrued interest totaled $473.  

On
September 17, 2015, the Company received $170,000 from a related party. Pursuant to the terms of the note, the note is bearing
an original issuance discount in the amount of $10,000 and is due on or before October 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, the
balance of the note is $0, and was fully repaid.  

In
the event that we are unable to obtain additional financing and/or funding or Mr. Halpern either fails to extend us more financing,
declines to loan additional cash, declines to fund the line of credit, or declines to defer his salary payments, we will no longer
be able to continue to operate and will have to cease operations unless we begin to generate sufficient revenue to cover our costs.  

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements   

In
April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2015-03, Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) ( ASU 2015-03 ), which changes the presentation
of debt issuance costs in financial statements. ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present such costs in the balance sheet as a
direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs will continue to be reported
as interest expense. It is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted.
The new guidance will be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating
the impact of adoption of ASU 2015-03 on its balance sheets.  

All
other newly issued accounting pronouncements but not yet effective have been deemed either immaterial or not applicable.   

Critical Accounting
Policies and Estimates   

Our
financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments and subjective
interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts reported.
These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information regarding
contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere to GAAP
and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our financial statements.  

Use of Estimates:

In
preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reported period.  Actual results could
differ from those estimates.  

Revenue Recognition:     

  Revenue
is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability
is assured. We had $0 and $0 in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  

Stock-Based Compensation:   

  In
December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation .  Under
FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation
arrangements based on the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which
employees are required to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans,
performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans.  As such, compensation cost is
measured on the date of grant at their fair value.  Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective
vesting periods of the option grant.  The Company applies this statement prospectively.  

Equity
instruments ( instruments ) issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments,
as required by FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 718.  FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505,  Equity
Based Payments to Non-Employees  defines the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments.  In general,
the measurement date is when either a (a) performance commitment, as defined, is reached or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee
performance is complete or (ii) the instruments are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a
period based on the facts and circumstances of each particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  

Derivative Financial
Instruments   

  Fair
value accounting requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments such as conversion features in convertible debt or equity
instruments, and measurement of their fair value for accounting purposes. In determining the appropriate fair value, the
Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  In assessing the convertible debt instruments, management determines
if the convertible debt host instrument is conventional convertible debt and further if there is a beneficial conversion feature
requiring measurement.  If the instrument is not considered conventional convertible debt, the Company will continue
its evaluation process of these instruments as derivative financial instruments.  

Once
determined, derivative liabilities are adjusted to reflect fair value at each reporting period end, with any increase or decrease
in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as an adjustment to fair value of derivatives.  In addition,
the fair value of freestanding derivative instruments such as warrants, are also valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model.    

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets   

  The
Company accounts for its long-lived assets in accordance with ASC Topic 360-10-05, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets.   ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires that long-lived assets, such as technology rights, be reviewed
for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying value of an
asset may no longer be appropriate.  The Company assesses recoverability of the carrying value of an asset by estimating
the future net cash flows expected to result from the asset, including the eventual disposition.  If the future net
cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference between the asset's
carrying value and fair value or disposable value.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company completed an impairment
analysis on its' long-lived assets, their technology rights, and determined that no impairment was necessary.  

The
Company believes that the accounting estimate related to asset impairment is a  critical accounting estimate  because
the impairment methodology is highly susceptible to change from period to period, because it requires management to make assumptions
about future cash flows, and because the impact of recognizing impairment could have a significant effect on operations. Management's
assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because actual business operations of marketing the technology
rights is in its infancy stages and managements expects that their future operating levels to fluctuate. The analysis included
assumptions that are based on annual business plans and other forecasted results which are used to reflect market-based estimates
of the risks associated with the projected cash flows, based on the best information available as of the date of the impairment
test. There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment tests will prove to be accurate
predictions of the future.  If the future adversely differs from management's best estimate of key economic assumptions,
and if associated future cash flows materially decrease, the Company may be required to record impairment charges related to its
indefinite life intangible asset.   

Prior
to February 2011, the Company's business operations were related to the development and launching of a social networking website.  However,
since February 2011, our business focus has been on the marketing of our Max Sound HD Audio Technology.  Since 2011,
was our initial year of marketing our technology, management considers past operational levels to be inconsistent with future
operations mainly due to the shift in business focus.  In our impairment testing, the Company made assumptions towards
the income and expenses expected in the future including, but not limited to, determining the actual expenses incurred in the
current year that were attributable to the new business focus in order to develop an annual cost benchmark, trends in the marketplace,
feedback from current and past marketing activities, and assessments upon the useful life of the technology rights.  

The
Company's primary focus over the next three to five years will be centered on the marketing and implementation of their technology
in order to take advantage of the current trends in the marketplace for users of their technology.  In particular, the
Company expects that expenses will increase significantly from year to year over the next five years, at which time in year nine
and beyond the year-to-year change will be a minimal increase.  In addition, the Company expects minimal revenue over
the next two years, while in year three to nine the Company expects to realize significant year to year increases in revenue,
at which time in year seven and beyond the year to year change will be a minimal increase.  

As
part of the impairment test, the Company reviewed its' initial useful life analysis, in reference to their technology, and updated
this analysis with factors that existed at the time of the impairment testing and determined that nothing had occurred in the
marketplace that would change their initial determination of the useful life of their technology. The analysis included researching
known technological advances in the marketplace and determining if those advances, which are similar to the Company s products,
would limit the useful life of the asset. The Company believes that the technological advances in the marketplace are geared
to developing different playback devices and the implementation of technology that is similar to the Company's technology. Thus,
the Company concluded that their technology rights continue to have an indefinite useful life. However, it is understood
that technological advancements could happen in the future that would limit the useful life of their technology.  If
a technology was created in the future that would limit the useful life of the technology, the Company would be required to update
their impairment testing to include a useful life determination of the technology and may be required to record impairment charges
at some time in the future.

amount under  this Note  shall  be $40,000.00,  consisting 
of the  First Tranche  plus the  prorated 
portion of the OID  (as defined herein).  The  Holder 
may  pay,  in their sole discretion,  such additional
amounts  of the  Consideration and at such dates as  the Holder may choose in
its  sole discretion.   THE  PRINCIPAL 
SUM DUE TO  THE HOLDER  SHALL  BE PRORATED 
BASED ON  THE CONSIDERATION ACTUALLY PAID  BY THE HOLDER, THE  APPLICABLE
PORTION  OF THE OID, AS WELL AS  THE APPLICABLE  INTEREST,  SUCH

   REPAY   
ANY UNFUNDED  PORTION   OF  THIS NOTE.  
The maturity date for  each tranche funded shall   be 
 eighteen  (18) months  from  the  effective 
date of  each payment (each  a  Maturity 

Date ),
and  is the date upon  which  the  principal

 any   accrued and unpaid interest and  other
 fees  relating to that  respective tranche, shall 
be due  and payable.  This Note may not be  prepaid 
in whole or in  part except as  otherwise explicitly set  forth
herein.   Any  amount of  principal 
or  interest  on this Note,  which  is not

shall  bear  interest at  the  rate 
of twenty two  percent  (22%) per annum  from 
the due  date thereof  until the  same  is
 paid ( Default Interest ). Interest shall commence accruing  on the date
that the Note is fully paid  and shall  be  computed 
on the  basis  of a 365-day  year and  the
 actual  number of  days  elapsed. All  payments 
due  hereunder  (to the extent not  converted 
into the  Borrower s common stock  (the   Common
Stock )  in  accordance  with the  terms
hereof) shall  be made in  lawful  money  of 
the United  States  of  America.  All  payments
shall  be made  at such address as  the  Holder 
shall  hereafter give  to the  Borrower

in full, the  extension  of the due  date thereof
shall  not be  taken  into  account 
for  purposes  of  determining  the  amount 
of  interest  due on  such date.  As  used

shall  mean   any day  other than a  Saturday, 
Sunday or a  day  on  which commercial banks 
in the city of New York,  New  York are authorized or  required

not be subject to  preemptive  rights or other  similar

The following  additional
terms shall  apply to this  Note:  

ARTICLE 
 I.   CONVERSION RIGHTS  

Conversion
Right .  The  Holder shall  have the right  at 
 any  time to  convert all  or  any 
 part  of the outstanding  and  unpaid  principal
amount  and  accrued and unpaid interest  of this Note into fully paid  and 
non-assessable  shares  of Common Stock,  as such 
Common  Stock exists  on the Issue  Date, 
or  any   shares  of  capital 
stock or other  securities  of the  Borrower 
into  which  such Common Stock shall  hereafter 
be  changed  or  reclassified at  the  conversion
price  (the  Conversion  Price ) determined as provided herein  (a
  Conversion   provided ,  however ,  that in no  event
shall  the  Holder  be  entitled  to
 convert  any portion of this Note in  excess 
of that portion of this Note upon  conversion  of  which 
the sum of (1) the number 

of  shares 
of Common Stock beneficially owned  by  the Holder  and 
its  affiliates  (other than  shares  of
Common Stock  which  may be deemed beneficially owned  through 
the  ownership   of  the  unconverted 
portion of the  Notes  or the unexercised or  unconverted 
portion of  any  other security of the  Borrower 
subject to a limitation on  conversion  or exercise  analogous 
to the limitations  contained herein) and  (2) the number  of 
 shares   of  Common Stock  issuable 
upon the conversion of the portion  of  this Note with  respect 
to  which  the  determination  of this proviso
is being  made,  would  result  in  beneficial
ownership   by  the Holder  and   its 
 affiliates  of more than 4.99% of the  outstanding
shares  of Common Stock.  For  purposes of the proviso to the immediately preceding
 sentence, beneficial  ownership  shall 
be  determined  in  accordance  with  Section 
13(d) of the  Securities Exchange Act  of 1934,  as
amended  (the  Exchange Act ), and  Regulations  13D-G  thereunder,
except as otherwise provided  in clause (1) of  such  proviso,   provided ,
 further ,  however ,  that the limitations on  conversion   may
be   waived   by  the Holder upon,  at 
the  election  of the  Holder,  not less
than 61  days   prior notice to the  Borrower,
and  the provisions of the  conversion  limitation  shall
continue  to apply until  such  61st day (or  such
later date, as determined   by  the Holder,  as 
 may be   specified  in  such 
notice of waiver). The number  of   shares 
of Common Stock to be  issued  upon  each 
conversion of this Note  shall  be  determined 
 by  dividing the  Conversion  Amount  (as
defined  below)  by  the  applicable Conversion
Price  then in  effect  on the  date specified 
in the  notice  of  conversion,  in the form
 attached hereto as  Exhibit A (the  Notice of Conversion ),  delivered 
to the  Borrower   by  the Holder in  accordance 
with  Section  1.4  below;  provided that
the Notice of  Conversion  is submitted  by 
 facsimile  or  e-mail  (or  by 
other  means  resulting in, or reasonably  expected 
to  result  in,  notice)  to the  Borrower 
before 6:00 p.m.,  New York,  New York time on  such 
conversion  date  (the  Conversion  Date ). 
The  term  Conversion  Amount   means, 
with  respect  to  any  conversion of this
 Note,  the sum of (1) the  principal amount 
of this Note to be  converted  in  such conversion 
 plus  (2)  at  the Holder s option,  accrued
and unpaid interest,  if  any,   on 
 such principal  amount  at  the  interest
rates provided  in this Note to  the Conversion Date,   plus  (3)  at 
the  Holder s  option,  Default Interest, 
if  any,  on the  amounts referred  to in
the immediately  preceding clauses  (1) and/or  (2) 
 plus  (4)  at  the  Holder s 
option,  any  amounts  owed  to the  Holder
pursuant  to  Sections  1.3  and 1.4(g) hereof.  

Conversion
Price .  

(a)    
   Calculation    of  Conversion 
Price . The  Conversion Price shall  be the  Variable
Conversion  Price (as  defined herein) (subject  to  equitable 
adjustments for stock splits, stock  dividends  or  rights
offerings   by  the  Borrower  relating
to the  Borrower s  securities or the  securities 
of any subsidiary of the  Borrower,  combinations,  recapitalization,
reclassifications,  extraordinary distributions  and similar events)  (also  subject 
to  adjustment as further described herein).  The   Variable
Conversion Price  shall mean  65%  multiplied  by the  Market
Price (as defined herein)(representing  a discount  rate  of  35%).
 Market Price   means the  lowest  one (1) Trading  Prices
(as  defined  below)  for the Common Stock during the ten (10) Trading Day  period
ending  on the last complete Trading Day prior to the  Conversion Date.  Trading 
Prices  means, for any security  as  of any  date, 
the  lowest traded  price on the  Over-the-Counter 
Pink  Marketplace, OTCQB,  or  applicable 
trading market (the  OTCQB )  as reported   by 
a  reliable  

reporting  service 
( Reporting  Service )  designated  by 
the  Holder (i.e.  www.Nasdaq.com) or, if the  OTCQB 
is not the  principal trading market  for  such
security,  on the  principal securities exchange  or trading  market 
where  such  security is listed or  traded 
or, if the  lowest  intraday  trading  price
of  such  security is not  available  in
any of the foregoing manners, the  lowest  intraday price of  any 
 market makers  for  such  security that
are quoted on the  OTC Markets.  If the Trading Prices cannot be  calculated 
for such security on  such  date in the manner  provided
above,  the Trading Prices  shall  be the  fair
market value as  mutually  determined   by 
the  Borrower and  the  holders  of a majority
in  interest  of the Notes  being converted 
for which the  calculation  of the  Trading 
Prices  are required  in  order  to determine
the  Conversion Price  of  such Notes.  Trading
Day  shall  mean any  day  on  which 
the Common Stock is  tradable  for  any  period
on the  OTCQB,  or on the  principal securities
exchange  or other securities  market  on  which 
the Common Stock is then  being traded.  If  at 
 any  time while this Note is  outstanding, 
the  lowest  Trading  Prices  on the  OTCQB 
 or  other  applicable principal  trading
 market  for the Common Stock is  equal 
to or  lower  than $0.005, then  an additional 
ten  percent  (5%) discount  shall  be  factored 
into the  Variable Conversion  Price until this Note is no longer outstanding  (resulting 
in a discount  rate  of 40%  assuming  no
other  adjustments are triggered  hereunder). In the  event 
that  shares  of the  Borrower s  Common
Stock  are  not deliverable via DWAC following the  conversion 
of  any  amount  hereunder, an additional 
ten  percent (5%)  discount  shall  be  factored 
into the  Variable Conversion Price  until this Note is no  longer
outstanding (resulting  in a discount  rate  of  40% 
assuming no other adjustments  are triggered  hereunder). 

Each 
time, while this Note is  outstanding,  the  Borrower 
enters into a  Section 3(a)(9) transaction  (including but not  limited 
to the  issuance  of  new  promissory notes
or of a  replacement  promissory  note), 
or Section 3(a)(10)  transaction,  in  which 
 any  3 rd  party has the  right 
to convert  monies owed  to that 3 rd 
party (or  receive shares  pursuant to a  settlement 
or  otherwise) at  a discount to  market greater 
than the  Variable Conversion Price  in  effect
at  that time  (prior  to all other  applicable
adjustments  in the  Note),  then the Variable  Conversion 
Price  shall  be automatically  adjusted 
to  such greater  discount  percentage  (prior
to  all applicable adjustments  in this  Note) 
until  this  Note is no  longer outstanding. Each 
time,  while  this Note is  outstanding, 
the  Borrower  enters into a  Section 3(a)(9) transaction 
(including but not limited to the  issuance   of 
new promissory notes  or  of a  replacement 
promissory note), or Section  3(a)(10) transaction,  in  which
any  3 rd  party  has  a look
 back period greater  than the look  back period 
in  effect  under the Note  at  that time
(currently a ten (10)  Trading   Day  look
back  period as described  in this  Section 1.2(a)
applies),  then the  Holder s  look  back
period shall automatically  be  adjusted  to  such
greater  number  of   days  until this
Note is no  longer outstanding.  The  Borrower
shall give written notice  to the Holder, with the  adjusted Variable  Conversion
 Price and/or adjusted  look  back period 
(each adjustment that is  applicable  due to the  triggering 
event), within one (1)  business   day of 
an event that  requires   any  adjustment
 described  in the two immediately  preceding 
sentences. 

Holder
shall  be  entitled  to  deduct  $300.00
 from  the  conversion amount  in  each 
Notice  of   Conversion  to  cover
Holder s  deposit  fees  associated  with
each  Notice of  Conversion.  

Authorized
Shares .  The  Borrower covenants  that during the  period 
the conversion  right  exists, the  Borrower 
will  reserve from  its authorized  and unissued 
Common Stock a  sufficient  number of  shares,
free  from  preemptive  rights, to provide for  the
issuance  of Common  Stock  upon the full  conversion 
of this  Note.  The  Borrower  is  required
at all  times to  have authorized and reserved  four times the number of  shares 
that is actually  issuable  upon full  conversion 
of the Note  (based  on the  Conversion Price 
of the Notes in  effect from  time to  time)(the
 Reserved  Amount ). The  Reserved  Amount  shall 
be  increased from  time to time in  accordance 
with the  Borrower s obligations  hereunder. The  Borrower
represents  that upon  issuance, such shares  will be duly  and 
validly issued, fully  paid and  non-assessable. In  addition, 
if the  Borrower shall  issue any securities or make any  change 
to its  capital structure which  would  change 
the number of  shares  of Common Stock  into which 
the  Notes shall  be  convertible at  the
then  current Conversion Price,  the  Borrower
shall at  the  same  time make  proper 
provision so that  thereafter  there  shall 
be a  sufficient  number of  shares  of Common
Stock  authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights,  for  conversion 
of the  outstanding  Notes. The  Borrower 
(i)  acknowledges  that it has irrevocably instructed its  transfer
agent  to issue  certificates  for the Common Stock  issuable 
upon  conversion  of this  Note, and  (ii)
 agrees  that its  issuance  of this Note
 shall constitute  full authority to its officers  and
agents  who are  charged  with the duty of  executing 
stock  certificates  to  execute and  issue
the necessary  certificates  for  shares 
of Common Stock in  accordance  with the  terms
and conditions  of this Note. 

If,
at   any  time the  Borrower does  not
maintain the  Reserved  Amount it will be  considered
an Event  of  Default under  Section 3.2 of the  Note.  

Method   
of  Conversion   .  

(a)    
   Mechanics    of Conversion .  Subject 
to  Section 1.1,  this Note may be  converted 
 by  the  Holder  in whole or in  part
at   any  time  from  time to time  after 
the  Issue Date,   by  

 (A)  
 submitting to the  Borrower  a Notice of  Conversion 
(by facsimile,  e-mail  or other  reasonable means 
of  communication dispatched  on the Conversion  Date 
prior to 6:00 p.m.,  New York, New York  time)  and
(B)  subject to  Section 1.4(b), surrendering  this Note  at 
the  principal office  of the  Borrower.  

(b)   
   Surrender     of  Note Upon
Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  set forth herein,  upon  conversion 
of this Note in  accordance  with the  terms hereof, 
the  Holder shall  not be  required  to physically
surrender this Note to the  Borrower  unless the  entire
unpaid principal amount  of this Note is so  converted.  The Holder and the  Borrower
shall  maintain  records  showing the principal  amount 
so  converted and  the  dates  of  such 
conversions or  shall  use  such  other method,
reasonably satisfactory to the  Holder and  the  Borrower, 
so  as  not to  require physical  surrender
of this Note upon  each such  conversion. In the  event 
of  any  dispute or  discrepancy, such  records
of the  Borrower  shall,  prima  facie,  
be  controlling and determinative  in the  absence 
of  manifest error.  Notwithstanding the  foregoing, 
if  any  portion of this Note is  converted as aforesaid, 
the  Holder   may  not  transfer 
this Note unless the  Holder first  physically 

surrenders 
this Note to  the Borrower, whereupon  the  Borrower 
will  forthwith  issue  and deliver  upon
the  order  of the  Holder  a  new 
Note of like  tenor, registered as  the  Holder 
(upon  payment   by  the  Holder 
 of any   applicable  transfer taxes) may
 request, representing  in the  aggregate 
the  remaining unpaid principal amount  of this  Note. 
The Holder  and   any   assignee, 
 by   acceptance  of this  Note,
acknowledge and agree  that,  by  reason of the provisions of this  paragraph, 
following  conversion   of  a portion of this
 Note,  the unpaid  and unconverted  principal
 amount  of this Note  represented   by 
this Note may  be  less than the amount  stated 
on the  face hereof.  

(c)    
   Payment     of  Taxes .
The  Borrower shall  not be  required  to
 pay any  tax  which   may 
be  payable   in   respect 
 of any  transfer  involved  in the issue
and  delivery  of  shares   of 
Common Stock or other  securities  or property on  conversion 
of this Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in  street  name),  and 
the  Borrower shall  not be  required  to
issue or  deliver  any  such shares   or 
other  securities  or property unless  and 
until the person or  persons (other  than the  Holder 
or the  custodian  in whose  street name such shares 
are to be  held  for the  Holder s account)
requesting  the issuance  thereof shall have paid  to the  Borrower 
the  amount  of any such tax or  shall have established 
to the  satisfaction  of the  Borrower  that
such tax  has been paid.  

(d)   
  Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion . Upon  receipt   by 
the  Borrower from  the Holder of a  facsimile 
transmission or  e-mail  (or other  reasonable 
means  of   communication)  of a Notice of
 Conversion  meeting the  requirements  for
conversion  as provided  in this  Section 
1.4, the  Borrower shall  issue  and  deliver
or  cause  to  be  issued  and
delivered  to or upon the  order   of 
the Holder  certificates  for the Common Stock  issuable 
upon  such   conversion  within  three
(3)  business  days after such  receipt (the   Deadline )
(and,  solely in the  case  of  conversion 
of the  entire unpaid principal amount hereof,  surrender of this  Note) 
in accordance with the  terms hereof.  

(e)    
   Obligation    of  Borrower 
to Deliver Common  Stock   .  Upon  receipt 
 by  the  Borrower  of a Notice of  Conversion, 
the  Holder shall  be  deemed  to be the
holder of  record  of the Common Stock  issuable 
upon  such  conversion, the outstanding principal  amount
and  the  amount  of  accrued and 
unpaid  interest  on this  Note shall  be
 reduced  to  reflect such conversion, and, 
unless the  Borrower defaults  on its  obligations
under  this  Article  I,  all rights 
with  respect  to the portion of this Note  being 
so  converted  shall  forthwith terminate 
except the  right  to receive the Common Stock or other  securities,
cash  or other  assets, as herein provided,  on  such
conversion.  If the Holder  shall  have  given 
a Notice of Conversion as  provided herein,  the  Borrower s
obligation  to issue  and  deliver the  certificates 
for Common Stock  shall  be  absolute and unconditional,
irrespective  of the  absence  of any action  by 
the  Holder  to  enforce  the same, any  waiver 
or  consent  with  respect  to  any 
provision  thereof,  the recovery of  any 
 judgment against   any  person  or 
any action to  enforce   the  same,  any 
 failure  or delay in the  enforcement  of
any other  obligation  of the  Borrower 
to the holder of  record,  or  any   setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment,  limitation or  termination,  or any  breach 
or  alleged breach   by  the  Holder 
of  any   obligation  to the Borrower,  and
irrespective  of  any  other  circumstance 
which  might otherwise  limit  such obligation 
of the  Borrower  to the Holder in  connection 
with such conversion. The 

Conversion
Date specified  in the Notice of  Conversion shall  be the  Conversion
Date  so long  as  the Notice of Conversion is  received 
 by  the  Borrower before  6:00 p.m.,  New
York,  New  York  time, on  such date.  

(f)    
  Delivery  of  Common Stock  by  Electronic
Transfer .  In   lieu  of  delivering
physical certificates representing  the Common  Stock issuable  upon conversion,
 provided  the  Borrower  is  participating 
in the Depository Trust Company ( DTC )  Fast Automated Securities Transfer 
( FAST )  program,  upon  request 
of the  Holder and  its  compliance  with
the provisions  contained  in Section 1.1  and 
in this Section 1.4, the  Borrower shall  use its  best
efforts  to  cause  its  transfer 
agent to  electronically  transmit the  Common
Stock issuable  upon conversion to the  Holder   by 
 crediting  the  account  of  Holder s 
Prime  Broker  with  DTC through  its  Deposit
Withdrawal Agent  Commission  ( DWAC ) system.  

(g)   
   Failure    to  Deliver  Common
Stock Prior to Deadline . Without in any  way  limiting the  Holder s
right  to pursue other  remedies,  including actual  damages 
and/or  equitable relief,  the parties  agree 
that if delivery of the Common Stock issuable upon  conversion  of this Note is not
 delivered  by the  Deadline  (other than
a  failure  due to the  circumstances described 
in  Section  1.3  above,  which failure shall
be  governed  by  such Section)  the  Borrower
shall  pay to the Holder $2,000  per   day 
in cash, for  each   day   beyond 
the  Deadline  that the  Borrower  fails
to  deliver such  Common  Stock. Such cash amount
shall  be  paid  to  Holder   by 
the  fifth   day of  the month following the
month in  which  it  has accrued  or,  at 
the option of the  Holder  (by  written notice 
to the  Borrower  by the  first  day of the
month following the month in  which  it  has accrued), 
shall be added to the  principal  amount of this  Note, 
in which  event interest  shall  accrue thereon 
in  accordance  with the  terms  of this
Note  and such additional principal amount shall  be  convertible 
into Common Stock in  accordance  with the  terms 
of this  Note.  The  Borrower agrees  that
the  right  to convert is a valuable  right 
to the  Holder.  The  damages resulting from 
a  failure, attempt  to  frustrate, interference 
with  such conversion right are  difficult if not impossible to  qualify.
Accordingly  the parties  acknowledge  that the  liquidated
damages  provision  contained  in this  Section
1.4(g) are  justified. 

Concerning   
the Shares . The  shares  of Common Stock  issuable 
upon conversion of this Note may not  be  sold or  transferred 
unless (i)  such shares  are sold  pursuant 
to  an effective registration  statement  under 
the Act or (ii) the  Borrower  or its  transfer
agent shall have  been  furnished  with  an 
opinion of  counsel (which  opinion  shall 
be in  form, substance and  scope customary for opinions of  counsel 
in  comparable transactions)  to the  effect 
that the  shares   to  be sold or  transferred 
may be sold or  transferred pursuant  to  an 
exemption  from such registration  or (iii)  such
shares are  sold or  transferred pursuant  to Rule  144
under  the  Act  (or a  successor rule) 
( Rule 144 ) or (iv)  such shares are transferred  to  an
 affiliate   (as  defined  in Rule 144) of the  Borrower 
who  agrees  to sell or otherwise transfer the  shares 
 only  in accordance with this Section 1.5 and who is  an
Accredited Investor. Except as otherwise provided (and subject  to the  removal 
provisions  set forth below),  until  such 
time  as  the  shares  of Common Stock  issuable 
upon conversion of this Note  have  been  registered 
under the 

Act 
or otherwise  may  be sold  pursuant  to Rule
144 without any restriction  as  to the number of  securities
as   of  a particular  date  that  can 
then be immediately sold,  each certificate  for  shares 
 of  Common Stock  issuable  upon conversion
of this Note that  has  not been so  included 
in an  effective registration statement  or that  has 
not  been  sold  pursuant  to an  effective
registration statement  or  an  exemption that  permits
removal  of the  legend,  shall  bear 
a legend substantially in the  following  form,  as
appropriate:  

NEITHER
THE     ISSUANCE AND  SALE  OF THE 
 SECURITIES   REPRESENTED  BY  THIS
CERTIFICATE   NOR   THE SECURITIES INTO WHICH
THESE   SECURITIES ARE   EXERCISABLE HAVE
BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES   ACT  OF  1933,
AS AMENDED,  OR  APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES  MAY  NOT 
BE  OFFERED  FOR  SALE, SOLD,   TRANSFERRED 
OR  ASSIGNED (I) IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES 
 UNDER  THE  SECURITIES   ACT 
 OF  1933,  AS   AMENDED, 
OR  (B) AN OPINION OF   COUNSEL   (WHICH 
 COUNSEL   SHALL  BE  SELECTED
BY THE HOLDER),  IN A  GENERALLY   ACCEPTABLE 
FORM,  THAT REGISTRATION  IS  NOT REQUIRED UNDER
SAID   ACT  OR (II)  UNLESS  SOLD  PURSUANT 
 TO   RULE  144 OR  RULE 
144A  UNDER   SAID   ACT. 
 NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING,   THE   SECURITIES 
MAY BE  PLEDGED  IN  CONNECTION WITH  A  BONA 
FIDE  MARGIN   ACCOUNT   OR
OTHER LOAN  OR  FINANCING ARRANGEMENT   SECURED 
BY  THE SECURITIES.    

The  legend
set  forth above  shall  be  removed and 
the  Borrower  shall issue to the  Holder 
a new  certificate therefore free  of  any 
transfer  legend   if  (i) the  Borrower 
or its  transfer agent shall  have  received an 
opinion of counsel, in  form, substance and scope  customary for opinions of  counsel 
in  comparable  transactions, to the  effect 
that a public sale or  transfer   of   such 
Common Stock may be made without  registration under  the Act,  which 
opinion  shall  be  accepted   by 
the  Borrower  so that the  sale  or  transfer 
is  effected  or (ii) in the  case  of the
Common  Stock issuable  upon conversion of this  Note, 
such security is registered for  sale   by 
the Holder under  an effective registration statement filed under  the Act or  otherwise 
 may be  sold  pursuant  to Rule 144 without
 any  restriction  as  to the number of securities
 as  of a particular  date  that can then
be immediately sold. In the  event  that the  Borrower
does  not  accept  the opinion of  counsel
provided  by the Holder with  respect  to the  transfer 
of Securities pursuant to  an  exemption  from
registration, such as  Rule 144 or  Regulation  S,  at 
the  Deadline,  it will be  considered an Event 
 of   Default  pursuant to  Section 
3.2 of the Note. 

Trading  Market
Limitations   . Unless permitted   by 
the  applicable rules and  regulations of the  principal 
securities  market  on  which  the Common
Stock is then listed or  traded,  in no  event
shall  the  Borrower  issue upon conversion of or  otherwise
pursuant  to this Note  more  than the maximum number of  shares 
of Common Stock that the  Borrower  can issue  pursuant 
to any rule of the  principal  United  States securities
market  on  which  

the Common Stock is then
 traded  (the  Maximum  Share Amount ), 
which  shall  be 4.99%  of  the  total
shares  currently  outstanding, subject  to equitable  adjustment
from  time to time for stock splits, stock  dividends, combinations, capital reorganizations
and similar events relating  to the Common Stock  occurring after  the date hereof.
 Once  the Maximum  Share  Amount  has 
been  issued,  if the  Borrower  fails to
 eliminate   any  prohibitions  under
applicable  law or the  rules  or  regulations 
of  any  stock  exchange, interdealer  quotation
 system  or other self-regulatory  organization 
with  jurisdiction over  the  Borrower  or
 any of  its securities on the  Borrower s 
ability to issue  shares  of Common Stock in  excess 
of the Maximum  Share  Amount, in  lieu 
of  any   further right  to  convert 
this  Note,  this  will  be  considered
an  Event of  Default under Section  3.3 of the  Note.  

Status  as
Shareholder   .  Upon  submission 
of a Notice of  Conversion   by  a Holder,
(i) the  shares covered  thereby  (other 
than the  shares,  if  any, which cannot 
be  issued  because their issuance would  exceed
such Holder s allocated  portion of the  Reserved  Amount or Maximum  Share 
Amount)  shall  be  deemed converted  into
 shares  of Common  Stock and  (ii) the  Holder s
rights as  a  Holder  of  such  converted
portion of this Note  shall cease and  terminate,  excepting 
 only  the right to receive  certificates 
for such  shares  of Common Stock  and  to
any  remedies provided herein  or  otherwise 
available  at  law or in equity to  such Holder
because  of a  failure  by the Borrower to comply with the  terms 
of this  Note.  Notwithstanding the  foregoing, 
if a Holder has not  received certificates  for  all
shares   of  Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th)  business 
day  after  the  expiration  of the  Deadline 
with  respect  to a  conversion  of  any 
portion of this Note for any reason, then  (unless  the  Holder 
otherwise  elects  to  retain  its status
 as  a  holder  of Common  Stock 
by so notifying the  Borrower)  the  Holder shall
regain  the  rights  of a Holder of this Note with  respect 
to  such unconverted  portions of this Note  and 
the  Borrower shall,  as soon  as practicable, 
return  such unconverted  Note to the  Holder 
or, if the Note has not been  surrendered, adjust  its  records
 to  reflect  that  such  portion of
this Note has not  been converted.  In all  cases, 
the  Holder shall retain all   of  its  rights
and remedies (including,  without  limitation,  (i)  the
right  to  receive  Conversion  Default Payments 
pursuant to  Section 1.3  to the extent  required 
thereby for such Conversion  Default and   any 
subsequent  Conversion Default and  (ii) the  right 
to  have  the Conversion  Price  with  respect 
to subsequent conversions  determined  in accordance with  Section 
1.3) for the  Borrower s  failure to convert this  Note.  

ARTICLE 
 II.   CERTAIN  COVENANTS 

Distributions
on  Capital  Stock . So long  as  the
 Borrower shall have   any   obligation 
under this  Note,  the  Borrower shall  not
without the  Holder s written consent  

 (a)    
 pay, declare or  set  apart for  such 
payment, any  dividend  or other distribution  (whether 
in  cash,  property or other  securities) 
on  shares  of  capital  stock other than

in the  form  of  additional shares  of Common
Stock or (b) directly or indirectly or through any subsidiary make any other  payment

disinterested directors.  

Restriction   
on Stock  Repurchases   .  So long  as 
the  Borrower shall have  any  obligation under 
this  Note,  the  Borrower shall  not  without 
the  Holder s written consent redeem, repurchase  or  otherwise
acquire (whether  for cash or in  exchange  for property or other  securities 
or  otherwise)  in  any  one  transaction 
or  series  of  related transactions   any 
 shares  of  capital  stock of the  Borrower 
or  any   warrants, rights  or options to
 purchase   or  acquire  any 
 such shares.  

ARTICLE 
 III.   EVENTS  OF  DEFAULT  

If   any 
of the following events of  default  (each,  an 
 Event of Default ) shall  occur:  

Failure   
to  Pay  Principal or  Interest   . 
The  Borrower  fails to  pay  the  principal
hereof   or   interest thereon  when
due on this  Note,  whether  at maturity, 
upon  acceleration  or otherwise,  and such breach
continues  for a period of five  (5) days.  

Conversion
and    the Shares . The  Borrower fails  to  reserve 
a  sufficient amount  of  shares  of  common 
stock  as required  under the terms of this Note (including  Section

on the  rights  of the  Holder with respect 
to this Note.

of Default  specified  in  Section  3.1 (solely
with  respect  to  failure  to pay the  principal
hereof  or  interest thereon when  due

OF  ANY EVENT  OF  DEFAULT SPECIFIED  IN
 SECTION  3.2,  THE NOTE  SHALL BECOME  IMMEDIATELY 
DUE  AND PAYABLE  AND  THE BORROWER SHALL 
PAY TO THE  HOLDER,  IN  FULL SATISFACTION 
OF ITS  OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER,  AN AMOUNT EQUAL  TO:
(Y)  THE  DEFAULT  SUM  (AS DEFINED

specified  in  Sections  3.1 (solely with  respect 
to failure to  pay  the principal  hereof 
 or   interest thereon when  due on this Note
 or  upon  acceleration),  3.3, 3.4, 3.5,

 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14,

specified  the remaining  sections  of  Articles

due  and payable and  the  Borrower shall 
pay to the  Holder,  in full  satisfaction 
of its  obligations hereunder, an  amount  equal 
to 200%   multiplied    by  the then  outstanding 
entire balance of the Note (including  principal and accrued  and  unpaid
interest)   plus   Default Interest,  if  any, 
 plus  any  amounts owed  to the  Holder pursuant 
to  Sections 1.4(g) hereof (collectively,  in the  aggregate 
of  all  of the  above,  the   Default
Sum ), and all  other  amounts payable  hereunder  shall 
immediately become due  and payable, all  without  demand,
presentment  or  notice, all  of  which 
hereby are expressly waived,  together  with  all 
costs,  including,  without limitation,  legal
fees and expenses,  of  collection, and  the  Holder 
shall be  entitled  to  exercise all  other
 rights  and  remedies available at law 
or in  equity.

Amount within ten  (10) business days   of 
 written notice  that  such amount  is due

the  right at   any  time, so long  as 
the  Borrower  remains in  default (and 
so long  and  to the extent that  there are sufficient
authorized shares),  to require the  Borrower,  upon  written 
notice, to immediately  issue,  in  lieu 
of the  Default  Amount, the number of  shares 
 of  Common Stock of the  Borrower equal 
to the  Default  Amount  divided   by 
the  Conversion Price  then in  effect, subject 
to  issuance  in  tranches  due to the  beneficial 
ownership limitations  contained  in this  Note.

or  Indulgence  Not Waiver . No  failure 
or delay on the  part  of the  Holder  in

or  privilege  hereunder  shall operate as 
a  waiver  thereof, nor shall any  single 
or  partial  exercise of  any   such 
power,  right   or   privilege
preclude  other or  further exercise thereof  or of  any 
other  right,  power or  privileges.  All

Assignability . 
This Note  shall  be binding upon the  Borrower
and  its  successors and assigns, and shall  inure to be the benefit of the  Holder
and  its  successors and assigns. Each transferee  of this Note must  be 
 an  accredited  investor   (as defined 
in Rule  501(a)  of the 1933  Act).  Notwithstanding
 anything  in this Note to the  contrary, 
this Note may be  pledged as collateral  in  connection 
with a  bona fide   margin  account or other lending  arrangement.  

Cost of  Collection   . 
 If   default  is made in the  payment 
of this  Note,  the  Borrower shall  pay
the  Holder hereof costs  of  collection, 
including  reasonable attorneys  fees.  

Governing
Law .  This Note  shall  be  governed 
 by   and construed  in  accordance 
with the  laws   of  the State of  New
York  without  regard  to  principles 
 of   conflicts  of  laws. 
Any action  brought   by  either party against
the other concerning the  transactions  contemplated  by 
this Note  shall  be  brought  only in the
state  and/or federal  courts of  New  York,
NY. The parties to this Note hereby irrevocably waive  any  objection to  jurisdiction
and venue  of  any  action instituted  hereunder
and shall  not  assert  any  defense based 
on  lack   of   jurisdiction 
or  venue   or  based upon  forum non  conveniens   . 
The  Borrower  and  Holder  waive  trial 
 by   jury.  The  prevailing 
party  shall  be  entitled  to  recover
from  the other party its  reasonable attorney's fees and costs.  In the  event 
that  any  provision of this Note  or any 
other  agreement delivered  in  connection herewith 
is invalid or  unenforceable  under  any 
 applicable  statute or rule of  law,  then
 such provision shall  be  deemed inoperative 
to the extent that it may  conflict therewith and shall  be  deemed
modified  to  conform  with  such 
statute or  rule  of  law.  Any  such
provision which   may  prove invalid or  unenforceable
under   any  law  shall  not  affect 
the validity or  enforceability  of  any 
other provision  of any  agreement.  Each 
 party  hereby irrevocably waives  personal service 
of process and  consents  to process being  served 
in  any  suit,  action   or 
 proceeding  in  connection  with this  Agreement 
 or any  other  Transaction  Document by mailing
a copy  thereof  via  registered  or  certified 
mail or  overnight  delivery (with  evidence 
of  delivery)  to  such  party  at 
the  address  in  effect  for notices to
it  under  this  Agreement and agrees  that
 such service shall constitute good and  sufficient  service 
 of   process and notice  thereof. Nothing
 contained herein shall  be  deemed  to limit
in any  way any   right  to  serve
process  in any other  manner permitted   by 
 law.  

Certain   
Amounts .  Whenever  pursuant to  this 
Note the  Borrower  is  required  to pay
 an amount  in  excess  of the  outstanding
principal amount  (or the portion  thereof required  to be paid  at 
that time) plus  accrued and  unpaid  interest 
plus  Default Interest  on  such interest, 
the  Borrower and  the  Holder agree  that
the actual  damages  to the  Holder from 
the  receipt  of  cash payment  on this Note
may be difficult to  determine and  the  amount 
to be so  paid  by the  Borrower represents stipulated
damages and  not a penalty  and  is 

intended 
to  compensate  the  Holder  in  part 
for loss of the opportunity to convert this Note  and  to  earn 
a return  from  the sale of  shares  of Common
Stock  acquired  upon conversion of this Note  at 
a  price  in  excess  of the  price 
paid for  such  shares  pursuant  to this
 Note.  The  Borrower and  the  Holder 
hereby  agree  that  such amount  of stipulated
 damages  is not plainly  disproportionate 
to the possible loss to the  Holder from  the  receipt 
of a cash  payment  without the opportunity to convert this Note into  shares 
of Common Stock. 

Remedies . 
The  Borrower acknowledges  that a  breach 
 by  it of its  obligations hereunder  will
 cause irreparable  harm to the  Holder, 
 by  vitiating the  intent and purpose  of
the transaction  contemplated hereby. Accordingly,  the  Borrower
acknowledges  that the remedy  at  law for a  breach 
of its  obligations under  this Note will be  inadequate
and agrees,  in the  event   of  a breach
or  threatened breach   by  the  Borrower 
of the provisions of this Note,  that  the  Holder
shall  be  entitled,  in  addition 
to  all  other  available remedies at  law
or in  equity, and  in  addition  to the
 penalties assessable herein,  to  an injunction 
or  injunctions restraining, preventing  or curing  any 
 breach  of this Note  and  to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions  thereof,  without the  necessity 
 of  showing economic loss  and  without any
bond or other security being  required.  

Prepayment . 
Notwithstanding  anything  to the contrary  contained 
in this  Note,  the  Borrower   may 
prepay  any   amount  outstanding under this
Note, during the  initial  90 day period  after 
the issuance of this  Note,   by  making a
 payment  to the  Holder  of  an
amount  in  cash equal  to 130%  multiplied 
the  amount  that the  Borrower   is 
 prepaying, subject  to the  Holder s 
prior  written acceptance  in  Holder s 
sole  discretion. Further,  the  Borrower 
 may  prepay  any   amount 
outstanding under this  Note,  from the  91 st 
day   through  the 180 th 
day  after  the issuance of this Note, by making a payment to the Holder of an amount
in cash equal to 145% multiplied the amount that the Borrower is prepaying. The Borrower may not prepay any amount outstanding
under this Note after the  180 th  
day after the issuance of this Note. 

Section
3(a)(10)    Transactions .  If   at 
 any  time while this Note is  outstanding, 
the  Borrower enters  into a  transaction structured 
in  accordance  with,  based  upon, or  related 
or pursuant to, in whole or in  part, Section 3(a)(10)  of the  Securities
Act  (a   3(a)(10) Transaction ),  then a  liquidated
damages charge  of 25% of the  outstanding principal balance   of 
this Note  at  that time, will be  assessed and 
will  become  immediately due  and payable 
to the  Holder,  either in the  form  of
 cash  payment or  as an addition  to the
 balance  of the  Note, as determined  by
 mutual agreement  of the  Borrower and Holder.  

Reverse   
Split  Penalty   .   If 
 at   any  time while this Note is  outstanding, 
the  Borrower effectuates  a reverse split with  respect 
to the Common Stock, then a  liquidated damages charge  of 15%  of 
the outstanding  principal balance  of this Note  at 
that time, will be  assessed and  will  become 
immediately due  and payable  to the Holder,  either 
in the  form  

of  cash payment 
or  as an addition  to the balance  of  the
Note,  as determined   by   mutual
agreement  of the  Borrower and  Holder. 

Right   
of  First  Refusal .  If   at 
 any  time while this Note is outstanding, the Borrower has a bona fide offer of capital
or financing from any  3 rd   party, pursuant to which
a convertible promissory note in the principal amount of $50,000.00 or less is to be issued, that the Borrower intends to act upon,
then the Borrower must first offer such opportunity to the Holder to provide  such capital 
or  financing  to the  Borrower  on the  same 
terms  as each respective 3 rd  party s terms. 
Should the  Holder  be unwilling or  unable 
to provide  such capital  or financing to the  Borrower 
within 2 trading  days from  Holder s  receipt 
of  written notice  of the  offer  (the   Offer
Notice ) from  the  Borrower,  then the Borrower may obtain such  capital 
or  financing from  that respective 3 rd  party upon
the  exact same  terms  and conditions offered 
by the  Borrower  to the  Holder, which transaction 
must be  completed  within  30   days
after  the  date  of the  Offer Notice. 
 If  the  Borrower  does not  receive 
the  capital  or financing from the  respective
3 rd   party within 30  days after  the  date 
of the  respective Offer Notice,  then the  Borrower 
must  again offer  the  capital  or  financing 
opportunity to the  Holder as described  above,  and 
the  process detailed above shall  be  repeated. 
The  Offer  Notice must be  sent  via  electronic 
mail to   Info@CrownBridgeCapital.com   .

CONVERTIBLE  PROMISSORY 
NOTE  

FOR
VALUE RECEIVED, M AX  S OUND 
C ORPORATION , a Delaware corporation (the   Borrower  ),
hereby promises to pay to the order of I LIAD   R ESEARCH
AND   T RADING , L.P., a Utah limited partnership, or registered assigns
(the   Holder  ), the sum of $171,665.00 (the   Original Principal Amount  ) together with any
additional charges provided for herein, on the date that is 12 months after the Issue Date (the   Maturity Date  ),
and to pay interest on the Outstanding Balance (as defined below) at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum from the date hereof
(the   Issue Date  ) until the same is paid in full;  provided that  upon the occurrence of an Event of Default
(as defined below), interest shall thereafter accrue on the Outstanding Balance both before and after judgment at the rate of fourteen
percent (14%) per annum (  Default Interest  ). All interest calculations hereunder shall be computed on the basis
of a 360-day year comprised of twelve (12) thirty (30) day months, shall compound daily and shall be payable in accordance with
the terms of this Note. The Borrower acknowledges that the Original Principal Amount exceeds the purchase price of this Note and
that such excess consists of the OID (as defined in the Purchase Agreement (defined below)) in the amount of 

 $16,665.00,
the Carried Transaction Expense Amount (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) in the amount of $5,000.00 to cover the Holder s
legal and other expenses incurred in the preparation of this Note, the Purchase Agreement, the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions,
and all other certificates, documents, agreements, resolutions and instruments delivered to any party under or in connection with
this Note, as the same may be amended from time to time (collectively, the   Transaction Documents  ), which sum
shall be fully earned and charged to the Borrower upon the execution of this Note and paid to the Holder as part of the outstanding
principal balance as set forth in this Note. This Note may not be prepaid in whole or in part except as otherwise provided in Section
1.8. All payments due hereunder (to the extent not converted into common stock, $0.00001 par value per share, of the Borrower (the
  Common Stock  ) in accordance with the terms hereof) shall be made in lawful money of the United States of America.
All payments shall be made at such address as the Holder shall designate from time to time by written notice made in accordance
with the provisions of this Note. Each capitalized term used herein, and not otherwise defined, shall have the meaning ascribed
thereto in that certain Securities Purchase Agreement dated the date hereof between the Borrower and the Holder, pursuant to which
this Note was originally issued (the   Purchase Agreement  ). For purposes hereof, the term   Outstanding
Balance   means the Original Principal Amount, as reduced or increased, as the case may be, pursuant to the terms hereof
for conversion, breach hereof or otherwise, plus any accrued but unpaid interest (including with limitation Default Interest),
collection and enforcements costs, and any other fees or charges incurred under this Note or under the Purchase Agreement. 

This
Note is free from all taxes, liens, claims and encumbrances with respect to the issue thereof and shall not be subject to preemptive
rights or other similar rights of stockholders of the Borrower and will not impose personal liability upon the holder thereof. 

The following additional terms shall
apply to this Note: 

1.   CONVERSION RIGHTS.   

1.1.             
   Conversion Right . Subject to Section 1.7, during the period beginning on the Issue Date and ending when the
Outstanding Balance is paid or converted in full, the Holder shall, at its option, have the right from time to time, to convert
all or any part of the Outstanding Balance of this Note into fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common
Stock exists on the Issue Date, or any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock
shall hereafter be changed or reclassified at the Conversion Price (as defined below) determined as provided herein (a   Conversion  ).
The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon each conversion of this Note (the   Conversion Shares  )
shall be determined by dividing the Conversion Amount (as defined below) by the applicable Conversion Price then in effect on the
date specified in the notice of conversion, in the form attached hereto as   Exhibit A   (the   Notice of Conversion  ),
delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section 1.4(a) below; provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted
by facsimile or e-mail (or by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the Borrower before 6:00
p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the   Conversion Date  ). The term   Conversion
Amount   means, with respect to any conversion of this Note, the portion of the Outstanding Balance to be converted. 

(a)                
   Calculation of Conversion Price . The conversion price (as the same may be adjusted from time to time pursuant
to the terms hereof, the   Conversion Price  ) shall mean 65% (the   Conversion Factor  ) multiplied
by the Market Price (as defined herein).   Market Price   means the average of the two (2) lowest Trading Prices
(as defined below) for the  Common  Stock during the ten 

 (10)
Trading Day (as defined below) period ending on the latest complete Trading Day prior to the Conversion Date. If an Event of Default
(as defined below) other than an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.1(i) occurs, then the Conversion Factor will be reduced
to 55%. If an Event of Default pursuant to Section 3.1(i) occurs, then the Conversion Factor will be reduced to 40%.   Trading
Price   means, for the Common Stock as of any date, the closing bid price on the Principal Market as reported by a reliable
reporting service designated by the Holder (e.g. Bloomberg) or, if the Principal Market is not the principal trading market for
such security, the closing bid price of such security on the principal securities exchange or trading market where such security
is listed or traded or, if no closing bid price of such security is available in any of the foregoing manners, the average of the
closing bid prices of any market makers for such security that are quoted in  OTC Pink  by Pink OTC Markets Inc. (formerly
Pink Sheets LLC), or any successor entity or other publisher thereof. If the Trading Price cannot be calculated for such security
on such date in the manner provided above, the Trading Price shall be the fair market value as mutually determined by the Borrower
and the Holder.   Trading Day   shall mean any day on which the Common Stock is traded or tradable for any period
on the Principal Market, or on the principal securities exchange or other securities market on which the Common Stock is then being
traded. 

(b)                
   Conversion Price During Major Announcements . Notwithstanding anything contained in Section 1.2(a) to the contrary,
in the event the Borrower (i) makes a public announcement that it intends to consolidate or merge with any other corporation (other
than a merger in which the Borrower is the surviving or continuing corporation and its capital stock is unchanged) or sell or transfer
all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or (ii) any person, group or entity 

(including
the Borrower) publicly announces a tender offer to purchase 50% or more of the Borrower s  Common 
Stock (or any other takeover scheme) (the date of the announcement referred to in clause (i)  or  

 (ii)
is hereinafter referred to as the   Announcement Date  ), then the Conversion Price shall, effective upon the
Announcement Date and continuing through the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date (as defined below), be equal to the lower
of (1) the Conversion Price which would have been applicable for a Conversion occurring on the Announcement Date, and (2) the Conversion
Price that would otherwise be in effect. From and after the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date, the Conversion Price shall
be determined as set forth in this Section 1.2(b). For purposes hereof,   Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date  
shall mean, with respect to any proposed transaction or tender offer (or takeover scheme) for which a public announcement as contemplated
by this Section 1.2(b) has been made, the date upon which the Borrower (in the case of clause (i) above) or the person, group or
entity (in the case of clause (ii) above) consummates or publicly announces the termination or abandonment of the proposed transaction
or tender offer (or takeover scheme) which caused this Section 1.2(b) to become operative. 

1.3.             
   Authorized Shares . The Borrower covenants that during the period the conversion right exists, the Borrower
will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares, free from preemptive rights, to provide
for the issuance of  Common  Stock upon the full conversion of this Note. The Borrower
is required at all times to have authorized and reserved three times the number of shares that is actually issuable upon full conversion
of this Note (based on the Conversion Price in effect from time to time) (the   Reserved Amount  ). The Reserved
Amount shall be increased from time to time as required to insure compliance with this Section 1.3. The Borrower represents that
upon issuance, such shares will be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non- assessable. In addition, if the Borrower shall
issue any securities or make any change to its capital structure which would change the number of shares of  Common 
Stock into which this Note shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at the same time make
proper provision so that thereafter there shall be a sufficient number of shares of  Common 
Stock authorized and reserved, free from preemptive rights, for conversion of this Note. The Borrower (i) acknowledges that it
has irrevocably instructed its transfer agent to issue shares of the  Common  Stock issuable
 upon  conversion of this Note, and (ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall
constitute full authority to its officers and agents who are charged with the duty of issuing the necessary shares of  Common 
Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note. If, at any time the Borrower does not maintain the Reserved Amount
it will be considered an Event of Default under Section 3.1(c). 

1.4.    Method of Conversion .   

(a)                
   Mechanics of Conversion . Subject to Section 1.7 hereof, beginning  on 
the date specified in Section 1.1, this Note may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time after
the Issue Date, by submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion (by facsimile, e-mail or other reasonable means of communication
dispatched on the Conversion Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time), otherwise the Conversion Date will be the next
Trading Day. 

(b)                
   Surrender of Note Upon Conversion . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, upon conversion
of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender this Note to the Borrower
unless the entire Outstanding Balance of this Note is so converted. The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing
the amount of the Outstanding Balance so converted and the dates of such conversions or shall use such other method, reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In
the event of any dispute or discrepancy, such records of the Holder shall,  prima facie,  be controlling and determinative
in the absence of manifest error. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as aforesaid, the Holder
may not 

transfer
this Note unless the Holder first physically surrenders this Note to the Borrower, whereupon the Borrower will forthwith issue
and deliver upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor, registered as the Holder may request, representing in the aggregate
the remaining Outstanding Balance of this Note. The Holder and any assignee, by acceptance of this Note, acknowledge and agree
that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted
Outstanding Balance of this Note represented by this Note may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof. 

(c)                
   Payment of Taxes . Borrower is responsible for the payment of all charges, fees, and taxes required to deliver
Conversion Shares to Holder;  provider, however , that Borrower shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable
in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and delivery of Conversion Shares or other securities or property on conversion
of this Note in a name other than that of the Holder (or in street name), and the Borrower shall not be required to issue  or 
deliver any such shares or other securities or property unless and until the person or persons (other than the Holder or the custodian
in whose street name such shares are to be held for the Holder s account) requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid
to the Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been
paid. 

(d)                
   Delivery of  Common  Stock Upon Conversion . On or before the close
of business on the third (3 rd ) Trading Day following the date of receipt
of a Notice of Conversion from the Holder via facsimile transmission or e-mail (or other reasonable means of communication) (the
  Delivery Date  ), the Borrower shall, provided that all  DWAC  Eligible
Conditions (as defined below) are then 

 satisfied,
credit the aggregate number of Conversion Shares to which the Holder shall be entitled to the account specified on the Conversion
Notice via the DWAC (as defined below) system. If all DWAC Eligible Conditions are not then satisfied, the Borrower shall instead
issue and deliver or cause to be issued and delivered (via reputable overnight courier) to the address as specified in the Notice
of Conversion, a certificate, registered in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Conversion Shares to which
the Holder shall be entitled;  provided, however , that, in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Holder may have
under this Note, then the Non-DWAC Eligible Adjustment Amount (as defined below) shall be added to the Outstanding Balance of this
Note as set forth in Section 1.6(f) below. For the avoidance of doubt, the Borrower has not met its obligation to deliver Conversion
Shares by the Delivery Date unless the Holder or its broker, as applicable, has actually received the shares electronically into
the applicable account, or if the DWAC Eligible Conditions are not then satisfied, has actually received the certificate representing
the applicable Conversion Shares no later than the close of business on the relevant Delivery Date pursuant to the terms set forth
above. For purposes hereof, the term   DWAC Eligible Conditions   means that (i) the Common Stock is eligible
at DTC (as defined below) for full services pursuant to DTC s operational arrangements, including without limitation transfer
through DTC s DWAC system, (ii) the Borrower has been approved (without revocation) by the DTC s underwriting department,
(iii) the Borrower s transfer agent is approved as an agent in the DTC/FAST Program (as defined below), (iv) the Conversion
Shares are otherwise eligible for delivery via DWAC, and (v) the Borrower s transfer agent does not have a policy prohibiting
or limiting delivery of the Conversion Shares via DWAC. For purposes of this Note, the term   DWAC   means Deposit
Withdrawal at Custodian as defined by the DTC; the term   DTC   means the Depository Trust Company; and the term
  DTC/FAST Program   means the DTC s Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program. 

(e)                
   Obligation of Borrower to Deliver  Common  Stock . If the Holder
shall have given a Notice of Conversion as provided herein, the Borrower s obligation to issue and deliver the shares of
 Common  Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of the absence of any
action by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision thereof, the recovery of any judgment
against any person or any action to enforce the same, any failure or delay in the enforcement of any other obligation of the Borrower
to the holder of record, or any setoff, counterclaim, 

recoupment,
limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower, and irrespective of
any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation  of  the Borrower
to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The Conversion Date specified in the Notice of Conversion shall be the Conversion
Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is delivered to the Borrower before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time, on such date;
otherwise, the Conversion Date shall be the next Trading Day. Once the Holder may freely trade the  Common 
Stock issuable upon a conversion of this Note pursuant to and in accordance with the terms hereof (and in the case of any certificates
delivered to Holder because not all of the DWAC Eligible Conditions are then satisfied, once such certificates have been deposited
into Holder s brokerage account, all legends have been removed therefrom, and the Common Stock represented by such certificates
is freely tradeable), all rights with respect to the portion of the Outstanding Balance being so converted shall forthwith terminate;
 provided, however , that the Holder shall be deemed to be the holder of record of the  Common 
Stock issuable  upon  such conversion as of the date Borrower receives the corresponding
Notice of Conversion. 

(f)                 
   Delivery of  Common  Stock via the  DWAC 
System . Notwithstanding any other provision contained herein, failure to deliver via the DWAC system any Common Stock to be
delivered to the Holder under this Section 1.4 shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and an Event of Default under Section
3 hereof, including without limitation under Sections 3.1(c) and 3.1(p). 

(g)                
   Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Delivery Date . Without in any way limiting the Holder s right
to pursue other remedies, including actual damages and/or equitable relief, the parties agree that if delivery of the Common Stock
issuable upon conversion of this Note is not delivered as required by Section 1.4(d) by the Delivery Date (a   Conversion
Default  ), the Borrower shall pay in cash to the Holder for each calendar day beyond the Delivery Date that the Borrower
fails to deliver such  Common  Stock an amount equal to $500 per day (the   Conversion
Default Payment  ). Such cash amount shall be paid to the Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in
which it has accrued (the   Conversion Default Payment Due Date  ). In the event such cash amount is not received
by the Holder by the Conversion Default Payment Due Date, at the option of the Holder (without notice to the Borrower), the Conversion
Default Payment shall be added to the Outstanding Balance of this Note, in which event interest shall accrue thereon in accordance
with the terms of this Note and such additional principal amount shall be convertible into Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Note. The Borrower agrees that the right to convert is a valuable right to the Holder. The damages resulting from
a failure, attempt to frustrate, or interference with such conversion right are difficult if not impossible to quantify. Accordingly
the parties acknowledge that the liquidated damages provisions contained in this Section 1.4(g) are justified. 

1.5.             
   Concerning the Shares . Transfer of the shares of  Common  Stock
issuable upon conversion of this Note is restricted and certificates representing such shares may bear a legend as set forth in
Sections 4.14 of the Purchase Agreement. 

1.6.    Effect of Certain Events .   

(a)                
   Fundamental Transaction Consent Right . The Borrower shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction
(as defined below), unless the Borrower obtains the prior written consent of the Holder to enter into such Fundamental Transaction.
For purposes of this Note,   Fundamental Transaction   means that (i) any  person  or  group 
(as these terms are used for purposes of Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder)
is or shall become the  beneficial owner  (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the 1934 Act), directly or indirectly, of
50% of the aggregate ordinary voting power represented by issued and outstanding voting stock of the Borrower, or (ii) (1) the
Borrower or any of its subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions, consolidate or merge with
or into (whether or not the 

Borrower
or any of its subsidiaries is the surviving corporation) any other individual, corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
association, trust or other entity or organization (collectively,   Person  ), or (2) the Borrower or any of its
subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions, sell, lease, license, assign, transfer, convey
or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all  of  its respective properties or assets
to any other Person, or (3) the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions,
allow any other Person to make a purchase, tender or exchange offer that is accepted by the holders of more than 50% of the outstanding
shares of voting stock of the Borrower (not including any shares of voting stock of the Borrower held by the Person or Persons
making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the Persons making or party to, such purchase, tender or exchange offer),
or (4) the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions, consummate a
stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization,
spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with any other Person whereby such other Person acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares
of voting stock of the Borrower (not including any shares of voting stock of the Borrower held by the other Person or other Persons
making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement
or other business combination), or (5) the Borrower or any of its subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly, in one or more related
transactions, reorganize, recapitalize or reclassify the Common Stock, other than an increase in the number of authorized shares
of the Borrower s  Common  Stock. The provisions of this Section 1.6(a) shall apply
similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion
of this Note. As a condition to pre-approving any Fundamental Transaction in writing, which approval may be withheld in the Holder s
sole discretion, Holder may require the resulting successor or acquiring entity (if not the Borrower) to assume by written instrument
all of the obligations of the Borrower under this Note and all the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such
successor or acquirer had been named as the Borrower hereto and thereto. 

(b)                
   Adjustment Due to Fundamental Transactions . If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding and prior
to conversion of all of this Note, there shall be any Fundamental Transaction that is pre-approved in writing by the Holder pursuant
to Section 1.6(a) above, as a result of which shares of  Common  Stock of the Borrower
shall be changed into the same or a different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of the Borrower
or another entity, or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower other than in
connection with a plan of complete liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall thereafter have the right to
receive upon conversion of this Note, upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of the shares
of  Common  Stock immediately theretofore issuable upon conversion, such stock, securities
or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive in such transaction had this Note been converted in full immediately
prior to such transaction (without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth herein), and in any such case appropriate
provisions shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the Holder of this Note to the end that the provisions hereof
(including, without limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion
of this Note) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be practicable in relation to any securities or assets thereafter
deliverable upon the conversion hereof. The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive Fundamental Transactions. 

(c)                
   Adjustment Due to Distribution . If the Borrower shall declare or make any distribution of its assets (or rights
to acquire its assets) to holders of Common Stock as a dividend, stock repurchase, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including
any dividend or distribution to the Borrower s stockholders in cash or shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock
of a subsidiary (i.e., a spin-off)) (a   Distribution  ), then the Holder of this Note shall be entitled, upon
any conversion of this Note after the date of record for determining stockholders entitled to such Distribution, to receive the
amount of such assets which would have been payable to the Holder with respect to the shares of 

Common 
Stock issuable upon such conversion had such Holder been the holder of such shares of  Common 
Stock on the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to such Distribution. 

(d)                
   Adjustment Due to Dilutive Issuance . If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding, the Borrower
issues or sells, or in accordance with this Section 1.6(d) hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of  Common 
Stock for no consideration or for a consideration per share (before deduction of reasonable expenses or commissions underwriting
discounts or allowances in connection therewith) less than the Conversion Price in effect on the date of such issuance (or deemed
issuance) of such shares of Common Stock (a   Dilutive Issuance  ), then immediately upon the Dilutive Issuance,
the Conversion Price will be reduced to the amount of the consideration per share received  by 
the Borrower in such Dilutive Issuance. 

The
Borrower shall be deemed to have issued or sold shares of  Common  Stock if the Borrower
in any manner issues or grants any warrants, rights or options (not including employee stock option plans), whether or not immediately
exercisable, to subscribe for or to purchase  Common  Stock  or 
other securities convertible into or exchangeable for  Common  Stock (  Convertible
Securities  ) (such warrants, rights and options to purchase  Common  Stock
or Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred to as   Options  ) and the price per share for which Common
Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then the Conversion Price
shall be equal to such price per share. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share for which  Common 
Stock is issuable upon the exercise of such Options  is determined by dividing (i) the total amount, if any, received or
receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or granting of all such Options, plus the minimum aggregate amount
of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Borrower upon the exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of Convertible
Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options, the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration payable upon the
conversion or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (ii) the maximum
total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all such Options (assuming full conversion of Convertible
Securities, if applicable). No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made upon the actual issuance of such  Common 
Stock upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of
such Options. 

Additionally,
the Borrower shall be deemed to have issued or sold shares  of Common  Stock if the Borrower
in any manner issues or sells any Convertible Securities, whether or not immediately convertible, and the price per share for which
Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then the Conversion
Price shall be equal to such price per share. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the  price per share for which
 Common  Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange  is determined by dividing
(1) the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or sale of all such Convertible
Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration, if any, payable to the Borrower upon the conversion
or exchange thereof at the time such Convertible Securities first become convertible or exchangeable, by (2) the maximum total
number of shares of  Common  Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such
Convertible Securities. No further adjustment to  the  Conversion Price will be made
upon the actual issuance of such  Common  Stock upon conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities. 

(e)                
   Purchase Rights . If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues any convertible
securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property (the   Purchase Rights  ) pro rata
to the record holders of any class of Common Stock, then the Holder of this Note will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable
to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if such Holder had held the number
of 

shares
of  Common  Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to
any limitations on conversion contained herein) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance
or sale of such Purchase Rights or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of  Common 
Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights. 

(f)                 
   Adjustment Due to Non-DWAC Eligibility . If, at any time when this Note is issued and outstanding, the Holder
delivers a Notice of Conversion and at such time all  DWAC  Eligible Conditions are not
then satisfied, the Borrower shall deliver certificated Conversion Shares to the Holder pursuant to Section 1.4(d) and the Non-DWAC
Eligible Adjustment Amount shall be added to the Outstanding Balance of this Note, without limiting any other rights of the Holder
under this Note or the other Transaction Documents. The   Non-DWAC Eligible Adjustment Amount   is the amount
equal to the number of applicable Conversion Shares multiplied by the excess, if any, of (i) the Trading Price of the Common Stock
on the Conversion Date, over (ii) the Trading Price of the Common Stock on the date the certificated Conversion Shares are freely
tradable, clear of any restrictive legend and deposited in the Holder s brokerage account. In any such case, Holder will
use reasonable efforts to timely deposit such certificates in its brokerage account after it receives them and cause such restrictive
legends to be removed, and, without limiting any other provision hereof, Borrower agrees to fully cooperate with Holder in accomplishing
the same. 

(g)                
   Adjustment Due to Late Clearing of  DWAC  Eligible Shares . If, at
any time when this Note is issued and outstanding, the Holder delivers a Notice of Conversion and at such time the Common Stock
is DWAC Eligible and the applicable DWAC Eligible Conversion Shares are delivered to Holder or its broker, but it takes longer
than five (5) business days after such delivery for such Conversion Shares to be electronically cleared for trading in Holder s
brokerage account, then the Late Clearing Adjustment Amount (as defined below) shall be added to the Outstanding Balance of this
Note, without limiting any other rights of the Holder under this Note or the other Transaction Documents. The   Late Clearing
Adjustment Amount   is the amount equal to the number of applicable Conversion Shares multiplied by the excess, if any,
of (1) the Trading Price of the  Common  Stock on the Conversion Date, over (2) the Trading
Price of the  Common  Stock on the date the certificated DWAC Eligible Conversion Shares
are electronically cleared for trading in the Holder s brokerage account. In any such case, and without limiting any other
provision hereof, each of Holder and the Borrower agrees to take all action reasonably necessary on its part to help ensure that
the applicable Conversion Shares are electronically cleared for trading in the Holder s brokerage account within the five-day
period described above. 

(h)                
   Notice of Adjustments . Upon the occurrence of each adjustment or readjustment of the Conversion Price or the
addition of the Non-DWAC Eligible Adjustment Amount or Late Clearing Adjustment Amount to the Outstanding Balance as a result of
the events described in this Section 1.6, the Borrower, at its expense, shall promptly compute such adjustment or readjustment
and prepare and furnish to the Holder a certificate setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Borrower shall, upon the written request at any time of the Holder, furnish
to such Holder a like certificate setting forth (i) such adjustment or readjustment, (ii) the Conversion Price at the time in effect
and (iii) the number of shares  of Common  Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities
or property which at the time would be received upon conversion of this Note. 

(i)                 
   Adjustments for Stock Split . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any references to share numbers
or share prices shall be appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock combination or other similar transaction. 

1.7.             
   Ownership Limitation . Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Note or the other Transaction
Documents, if at any time the Holder shall or would be issued shares of  Common  Stock
under any of the Transaction Documents, but such issuance would cause the Holder (together with its Affiliates) to beneficially
own a number of shares exceeding 4.99% of the number of shares of  Common  Stock outstanding
on such date (including for such purpose the shares of  Common  Stock issuable upon such
issuance) (the   Maximum Percentage  ), then the Company must not issue to the Holder shares of the Common Stock
which would exceed the Maximum Percentage. For purposes of this Section, beneficial ownership of Common Stock will be determined
under the 1934 Act. The shares of  Common  Stock issuable to the Holder that would cause
the Maximum Percentage to be exceeded are referred to herein as the   Ownership Limitation Shares  . The Company
will reserve the Ownership Limitation Shares for the exclusive benefit of the Holder. From time to time, the Holder may notify
the Company in writing of the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares that may be issued to the Holder without causing the Holder
to exceed the Maximum Percentage. Upon receipt of such notice, the Company shall be unconditionally obligated to immediately issue
such designated shares to the Holder, with a corresponding reduction in the number of the Ownership Limitation Shares. Notwithstanding
the forgoing, the term  4.99%  above shall be replaced with  9.99%  at such time as the Market Capitalization
of the  Common  Stock is less than $5,000,000.00. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained herein, if the term  4.99%  is replaced with  9.99%  pursuant to the preceding sentence, such
increase to  9.99%  shall remain at 9.99% until increased, decreased or waived by the Holder as set forth below. For
purposes of this Note, the term   Market Capitalization of the  Common  Stock  
shall mean the product equal to (A) the average  VWAP  of the Common Stock for the immediately
preceding fifteen 

 (15)
Trading Days, multiplied by (B) the aggregate number of outstanding shares of  Common 
Stock as reported on the Company s most recently filed Form 10-Q or Form 10-K. By written notice to the Company, the Holder
may increase, decrease or waive the Maximum Percentage as to itself but any such waiver will not be effective until the 61st day
after delivery thereof. The foregoing 61-day notice requirement is enforceable, unconditional and non-waivable and shall apply
to all Affiliates and assigns of the Holder. 

1.8.             
   Prepayment . So long as the Borrower has not received a Notice of Conversion from the Holder, then at any time
during the period beginning on the Issue Date and ending on the date which is one hundred eighty (180) calendar days following
the Issue Date, the Borrower shall have the right, exercisable on not less than thirty (30) Trading Days prior written notice to
the Holder to prepay the Outstanding Balance of this Note, in full, in accordance with this Section 1.8. Any notice of prepayment
hereunder (an   Optional Prepayment Notice  ) shall be delivered to the Holder at its registered addresses and
shall state: (a) that the Borrower is exercising its right to prepay this Note, and (b) the date of prepayment, which shall be
not more than three (3) Trading Days from the date of the Optional Prepayment Notice. On the date fixed for prepayment (the   Optional
Prepayment Date  ), the Borrower shall make payment of the Optional Prepayment Amount (as defined below) to or upon the
order of the Holder as specified by the Holder in writing to the Borrower at least one (1) Trading Day prior to the Optional Prepayment
Date. If the Borrower exercises its right to prepay this Note, the Borrower shall make payment to the Holder of an amount in cash
(the   Optional Prepayment Amount  ) equal to 120%, multiplied by the then Outstanding Balance of this Note. If
the Borrower delivers an Optional Prepayment Notice and fails to pay the Optional Prepayment Amount due to the Holder within two
(2) Trading Days following the Optional Prepayment Date, the Borrower shall forever forfeit its right to prepay this Note pursuant
to this Section 1.8. 

2.    CERTAIN COVENANTS .   

2.1.             
   Distributions on Capital Stock . So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation under this Note, the Borrower
shall not without the Holder s written consent (a) pay, declare or set apart for such payment, any dividend or other distribution
(whether in cash, property or other securities) on shares of capital stock other than dividends on shares of  Common 
Stock solely in the form of additional shares of  Common  Stock, or (b) directly or indirectly

loans, credits or advances (a) in existence or committed on the date hereof and which the Borrower has informed Holder in writing

4.    MISCELLANEOUS .   

4.1.             
   Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver . No failure or delay on the part of the Holder in the exercise of any power,
right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right

hereunder are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies otherwise available. 

4.2.             
   Notices . Whenever notice is required to be given under this Note, unless otherwise provided herein, such notice
shall be given in accordance with the subsection of the Purchase Agreement titled  Notices.  

4.3.             
   Amendments . This Note and any provision hereof may only be amended by an instrument in writing signed by the
Borrower and the Holder. The term   Note   and all reference thereto, as used throughout this instrument, shall
mean this instrument (and the other Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement) as originally executed, or if later amended
or supplemented, then as so amended or supplemented. 

4.4.             
   Assignability . This Note shall be binding upon the Borrower and its successors and assigns, and shall inure
to be the benefit of the Holder and its successors and assigns;  provided, however,  that this Note may not be transferred,
assigned or conveyed by the Borrower without the prior written consent of the Holder. Each transferee of this Note must be an  accredited
investor  (as defined in Rule 501(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the   1933 Act  )). Notwithstanding
anything in this Note to the contrary, this Note may be pledged as collateral in connection with a  bona fide  margin account
or other lending arrangement. 

4.5.             
   Cost of Collection; Attorneys  Fees . Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, the Borrower shall
pay to the Holder hereof all costs and reasonable attorneys  fees incurred by the Holder in connection with such Event of
Default. In the event of any action at law or in equity to enforce or interpret the terms of this Note or any of the other Transaction
Documents, the parties agree that the party who is awarded the most money shall be deemed the prevailing party for all purposes
and shall therefore be entitled to an additional award of the full amount of the attorneys  fees and expenses paid by such
prevailing party in connection with the litigation and/or dispute without reduction or apportionment based upon the individual
claims or defenses giving rise to the fees and expenses. Nothing herein shall restrict or impair a court s power to award
fees and expenses for frivolous or bad faith pleading. 

4.6.             
   Governing Law . This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Utah
without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. Any action brought by either party against the other concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Note shall be brought only in the state courts of Utah or in the federal courts located in Salt Lake County,
Utah. The parties to this Note hereby irrevocably waive any objection to jurisdiction and venue of any action instituted hereunder
and shall not assert any defense based on lack of jurisdiction or venue or based upon  forum non conveniens . In the event
that any provision of this Note or any other agreement delivered in connection herewith is invalid or unenforceable under any applicable
statute or rule of law, then such provision shall be deemed inoperative to the extent that it may conflict therewith and shall
be deemed modified to conform with such statute or rule of law. Any such provision which may prove invalid or unenforceable under
any law shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision of any agreement. Each party hereby irrevocably
waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any suit, action or proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or any other related or companion documents by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery
(with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement and agrees that such
service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
limit in any way any right to serve process in any other manner permitted  by  law. THE
BORROWER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO, AND AGREES NOT TO REQUEST, A JURY TRIAL FOR THE ADJUDICATION OF ANY
DISPUTE HEREUNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH OR ARISING OUT OF THIS NOTE OR  ANY  TRANSACTION
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 

4.7.             
   Fees and Charges . The parties acknowledge and agree that upon the Borrower s failure to comply with
the provisions of this Note, the Holder s damages would be uncertain and difficult (if not impossible) to accurately estimate
because of the parties  inability to predict future interest rates, the Holder s increased risk, and the uncertainty
of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for the Holder, among other reasons. Accordingly, any fees,
charges, and interest due under this Note are intended by the parties to be, and shall be deemed, a reasonable estimate of the
Holder s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not a penalty, and shall not be deemed in any way to limit any other
right or remedy Holder may have hereunder, at law or in equity. 

4.8.             
   Remedies . The Borrower acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable
harm to the Holder, by vitiating the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly, the Borrower acknowledges
that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this Note will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of a breach
or threatened breach  by  the Borrower of the provisions of this Note, that the Holder
shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies at law or in equity, and in addition to the charges assessable herein,
to an injunction or injunctions restraining, preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions thereof, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. 

4.9.             
   Purchase Agreement . By its acceptance of this Note, each party agrees to be bound by the applicable terms
of the Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. 

4.10.          
   Notice of Corporate Events . Except as otherwise provided herein, the Holder of this Note shall have no rights
as a Holder of Common Stock unless and only to the extent that it converts this Note into Common Stock. The Borrower shall provide
the Holder with prior notification of any meeting of the Borrower s stockholders (and copies of proxy materials and other
information sent to stockholders). In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of its stockholders for the purpose of
determining stockholders who are entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution, any right to subscribe for,
purchase or otherwise acquire (including by way of merger, consolidation, reclassification or recapitalization) any share of any
class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other right, or for the purpose of determining stockholders who are
entitled to vote in connection with any proposed sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower
or any proposed liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Borrower, the Borrower shall mail a notice to the Holder, at least
twenty (20) calendar days prior to the record date specified therein (or thirty (30) calendar days prior to the consummation of
the transaction or event, whichever is earlier), of the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution, right or other event, and a brief statement regarding the amount and character of such dividend, distribution, right
or other event to the extent known at such time. The Borrower shall make a public announcement of any event requiring notification
to the Holder hereunder substantially simultaneously with the notification to the Holder in accordance with the terms of this Section
4.10. 

4.11.          
   Pronouns . All pronouns and any variations thereof refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter, singular or
plural, as the context may permit or require. 

4.12.          
   Time of the Essence . Time is expressly made of the essence of each and every provision of this Note.

if such issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of
a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share except in the event that rounding up would violate the conversion limitation
set forth in section 2(b) above.   

d.   Conversion Amount. The Conversion Amount shall be converted pursuant to
Rule 144(b)(1)(ii) and Rule 144(d)(1)(ii) as promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended, into unrestricted shares at the Conversion Price.   

e.   Mechanics of Conversion. The conversion of this Note shall be conducted in the following manner:   

i.  Holder s Conversion Requirements. To convert this Note into shares
of Common Stock on any date set forth in the Conversion Notice by the Holder (the  Conversion Date ), the Holder shall
transmit by email, facsimile or otherwise deliver, for receipt on or  pr  i  or 
 to   11:  59 
 p.m.,   Easte  rn 
 Ti  m  e  , 
 on   such date   or
on   the next bus  in  ess
day  ,  a  copy of  a  full  y
executed not  i  ce   of 
 co  nversi  o  n 
 in the  form attached hereto as Exhibit 1 to the Company.   

ii.  Company s Response. Upon receipt by the Company of a copy of a Conversion
Notice, the Company shall as soon as practicable, but in no   

event
later than one (1) Business Day after receipt of such Conversion Notice, send, via email, facsimile or overnight courier, a confirmation
of receipt of such Conversion Notice to such Holder indicating that the Company will process such Conversion Notice in accordance
with the terms herein. Within two (2) Business Days after the date the Conversion Notice is delivered, the Company shall have issued
and electronically transferred the shares to the Broker indicated in the Conversion Notice; should the Company be unable to transfer
the shares electronically, it shall, within two (2) Business Days after the date the Conversion Notice was delivered, have surrendered
to an overnight courier for delivery the next day to the address as specified in the Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered
in the name of the Holder, for the number of shares of Common Stock to which the Holder shall be entitled.  

iii.  Record Holder. The person or persons entitled to receive the shares of  Co  mm  o  n 
 Stoc  k   is  s  ua  b  le 
 upo  n  a  co  nversi  o  n 
 of   thi  s 
 Note   sh  all 
 be   tre  a  ted 
 fo  r all pu  r  poses 
 as the   re  cord 
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date.   

iv.  Timely Response by Company. Upon receipt by Company of a Conversion Notice,
Company shall respond within one business day to Holder confirming the details of the Conversion, and provide within two business
days the Shares requested in the Conversion Notice.   

v.  Liquidated Damages for Delinquent Response. If the Company fails to deliver
for whatever reason (including any neglect or failure by,   e.g.,  
the Company, its counsel or the transfer agent) to Holder the Shares as requested in a Conversion Notice within three (3) business
days of the Conversion Date, the Company shall be deemed in  Default of Conversion.  Beginning on the fourth (4 th )
business day after the date of the Conversion Notice, after the Company is deemed in Default of Conversion, there shall accrue
liquidated damages (the  Conversion Damages ) of $2,000 per day for each day after the third business day until delivery
of the Shares is made, and such penalty will be added to the Note being converted (under the Company s and Holder s
expectation and understanding that any penalty amounts will tack back to the Issuance Date of the Note). The Parties agree that,
at the time of drafting of this Note, the Holder s damages as to the delinquent response are incapable or difficult to estimate
and that the liquidated damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.   

vi.  Liquidated Damages for Inability to Issue Shares. If the Company fails to
deliver Shares requested by a Conversion Notice due to an exhaustion of authorized and issuable common stock such that the Company
must increase the number of shares of authorized Common Stock before the Shares requested may be issued to the Holder, the discount
set forth in the Conversion Price will be increased by 5 percentage points (i.e. from 40% to 45%) for the Conversion Notice in
question and all future Conversion Notices until the outstanding principal and interest of the Note is converted or paid in full.
These liquidated damages shall not render the penalties prescribed by Paragraph 2(e)(v) void, and shall be applied in conjunction
with Paragraph 2(e)(v) unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Holder. The Parties agree that, at the time of drafting of
this Note, the Holder s damages as to the inability to issue shares are incapable or difficult to estimate and that the liquidated
damages called for is a reasonable forecast of just compensation.   

vii.  Rescindment of Conversion Notice. If: (i) the Company fails to respond to
Holder within one business day from the date of delivery of a Conversion Notice confirming the details of the Conversion, (ii)
the Company fails to provide the Shares requested in the Conversion Notice within three business days from the date of the delivery
of the Conversion Notice, (iii) the Holder is unable to procure a legal opinion required to have the Shares issued unrestricted
and/or deposited to sell for any reason related to the Company's standing with the SEC or FINRA, or any action or inaction by the
Company, (iv) the Holder is unable to deposit the Shares requested in the Conversion Notice for any reason related to the Company's
standing with the SEC or FINRA, or any action or inaction by the Company, (v) if the Holder is informed that the Company does not
have the authorized and issuable Shares available to satisfy the Conversion, or (vi) if OTC Markets changes the Company's designation
to 'Limited Information' (Yield), 'No Information' (Stop Sign), 'Caveat Emptor' (Skull and Crossbones), or 'OTC', 'Other OTC' or
'Grey Market' (Exclamation Mark Sign) on the day of or any day after the date of the Conversion Notice, the Holder maintains the
option and sole discretion to rescind the Conversion Notice ( Rescindment ) by delivering a notice of rescindment to
the Company in the same manner that a Conversion Notice is required to be delivered to the Company pursuant to the terms of this
Note.   

viii.  Transfer Agent Fees and Legal Fees. The issuance of the certificates shall
be without charge  or  expense to the Holder. The Company shall pay any and all Transfer
Agent fees, legal fees, and advisory fees required for execution of this Note and processing of any Notice of Conversion, including
but not limited to the cost of obtaining a legal opinion with regard to the Conversion. The Holder will deduct $1,000 from the
principal payment of the Note solely to cover the cost  of  obtaining any and all legal
opinions required to obtain the Shares requested in any given Conversion Notice. These fees do not make provision for or suffice
to defray any legal fees incurred in collection or enforcement of the Note as described in Paragraph 13.   

ix.  Conversion Right Unconditional. If the Holder shall provide a Notice of Conversion
as provided herein, the Company s obligations to deliver Common Stock shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of
any claim of setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, or alleged breach by the   

Holder 
 of   any obligation to the Company.  

3.  Other Rights of Holder: Reorganization, Reclassification, Consolidation,
Merger or Sale.  An  y  recapitalization,
reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets to another
Person or other transaction which is effected in such a way that holders of Common Stock are entitled to receive (either directly
or upon subsequent liquidation) stock, securities, cash or other assets with respect to or in exchange for Common Stock is referred
to herein as  Organic Change.  Prior to the consummation of any (i) Organic Change or (ii) other Organic Change following
which the Company is not a surviving entity, the Company will secure from the Person purchasing such assets or the successor resulting
from such Organic Change (in each case, the  Acquiring Entity ) a written agreement (in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Holder) to deliver to Holder in exchange for this Note, a security of the Acquiring Entity evidenced by a written
instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Note, and reasonably satisfactory to the Holder. Prior to the consummation
of   

any other Organic Change, the
Company shall make appropriate provision (in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder) to ensure  th  a  t
the Ho  l  de  r
will   there  af  te  r
have   the   ri  g  h  t 
 to   acq  uir  e
and rece  iv  e in   lieu 
 of or   in   add  i  t  i  o  n 
 to   (a  s 
 the  case may be) the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore acquirable and
receivable upon the conversion of the Note, such shares of stock, securities, cash or other assets that would have been issued
or payable in such Organic Change with respect to or in exchange for the number of shares of Common Stock which would have been
acquirable and receivable upon the conversion of the Note as of the date of such Organic Change (without taking into account any
limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Note set forth in Section 2(b) or otherwise). All provisions of this Note
must be included to the satisfaction of Holder in any new Note created pursuant to this section.

closing price). If the shares have not been delivered with- in 3 business days, the Notice of Conversion may be rescinded. Such
conversion shall be effec- tuated by the Company delivering the shares of Common Stock to the Holder within 3 business days of
receipt by the Company of the Notice of Conversion. Accrued but unpaid interest shall be subject to conversion. No fractional shares
or scrip representing fractions of shares will be is- sued on conversion, but the number of shares issuable shall be rounded to
the nearest whole share .  The Company agrees to honor all conversions submitted pending this increase.  In the event the
Company experiences a DTC  Chill  on its shares, the conversion price shall be de- creased to 50% instead of 60% while
that  Chill  is in effect.  In no event shall the Holder be al- lowed to effect a conversion if such conversion,
along with all other shares of Company Com- mon Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates would exceed 9.9% of
the out- standing shares of the Common Stock of the Company. The conversion discount and look back period will be adjusted on a
ratchet basis if the Company offers a more favorable conversion dis- count (whether through a straight discount or in combination
with an original issue discount) or look back period to another party while this note is in effect. 

(b)               
 Interest on any unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be paid at the rate of 10% per annum. Interest shall be paid
by the Company in Common Stock ( Interest Shares ). Holder may, at any time, send in a Notice of Conversion to the Company
for Interest Shares based on the formula provided in Section 4(a) above. The dollar amount converted into Interest Shares shall
be all or a portion of the accrued interest calculated on the unpaid principal balance of this Note to the date of such notice. 

(c)                
 During the first six months this Note is in effect, the Company may re- deem this Note by paying to the Holder an amount
as follows: (i) if the redemption occurs within the first 30 days then an amount equal to 130% of the unpaid principal amount of
this Note along with any prepaid and earned interest, (ii) if the redemption occurs after the 31 st 
day but before the 60 th  day following the issuance of this Note, then an
amount equal to 135% of the unpaid principal amount of this Note along with any prepaid and earned interest, (iii) if the redemption
occurs after the 61 st  day but before the 90 th 
day following the issuance of this Note, then an amount equal to 140% of the unpaid principal amount of this Note along with any
prepaid and earned interest, (iv) if the redemption occurs after the 91 st 
day but before the 120 th  day follow- ing the issuance of this Note, then
an amount equal to 145% of the unpaid principal amount of this Note along with any prepaid and earned interest, (v) if the redemption
occurs after the 121 st  day but before the 180 th 
day following the issuance of this Note, then an amount equal to 150% of the unpaid principal amount of this Note along with any
prepaid and earned interest. This Note may not be redeemed after 180 days. The redemption must be closed and paid for within 3
business days of the Company sending the redemption demand or the redemption will be invalid and the Company may not redeem this
Note. 

(d)               
 Upon (i) a transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to any person in a single transaction or series
of related transactions, (ii) a reclassification, capital reorganization or other change or exchange of outstanding shares of the
Common Stock, other than a forward or reverse stock split or stock dividend, or (iii) any consolidation or merger of the Company
with or into another person or entity in which the Company is not the surviving entity (other than a merger which is effected solely
to change the jurisdiction of incorporation of the Company and results in a reclassification, conversion or exchange of outstanding
shares of Common Stock solely into shares of Common Stock) (each of items (i), (ii) and (iii) being re- ferred to as a  Sale
Event ), then, in each case, the Company shall, upon request of the Holder, redeem this Note in cash for 150% of the principal
amount, plus accrued but unpaid interest through the date of redemption, or at the election of the Holder, such Holder may convert
the un- paid principal amount of this Note (together with the amount of accrued but unpaid interest) into shares of Common Stock
immediately prior to such Sale Event at the Conversion Price. 

(e)                
 In case of any Sale Event (not to include a sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets) in connection
with which this Note is not redeemed or converted, the Company shall cause effective provision to be made so that the Holder of
this Note shall have the right thereafter, by converting this Note, to purchase or convert this Note into the kind and number of
shares of stock or other securities or property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, capital reorganization
or other change, consolidation or merger by a holder of 

the number of shares
of Common Stock that could have been purchased upon exercise of the Note and at the same Conversion Price, as defined in this Note,
immediately prior to such Sale Event. The foregoing provisions shall similarly apply to successive Sale Events. If the considera-
tion received by the holders of Common Stock is other than cash, the value shall be as deter- mined by the Board of Directors of
the Company or successor person or entity acting in good faith. 

5.                  
 No provision of this Note shall alter or impair the obligation of the Com- pany, which is absolute and unconditional, to
pay the principal of, and interest on, this Note at the time, place, and rate, and in the form, herein prescribed. 

6.                  
 The Company hereby expressly waives demand and presentment for pay- ment, notice of non-payment, protest, notice of protest,
notice of dishonor, notice of acceleration or intent to accelerate, and diligence in taking any action to collect amounts called
for hereunder and shall be directly and primarily liable for the payment of all sums owing and to be owing hereto. 

7.                  
 The Company agrees to pay all costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, which may be incurred
by the Holder in collecting any amount due under this Note. 

8.  If one or more of the following described  Events of Default  shall occur:

(c)                  
 The Company shall fail to perform or observe, in any respect, any cove- nant, term, provision, condition, agreement or obligation
of the Company under this Note or any other note issued to the Holder; or 

(d)                 
 The Company shall (1) become insolvent (which does not include a  go- ing concern opinion); (2) admit in writing its
inability to pay its debts generally as they mature; 

 (3)   
 make an assignment for the benefit of creditors or commence proceedings for its dissolution; 

 (4)   
 apply for or consent to the appointment of a trustee, liquidator or receiver for its or for a sub- stantial part of its

it an involuntary petition for bankruptcy relief, all under federal or state laws as applicable; or 

(e)  A trustee, liquidator or receiver shall be appointed for the Company or for   

a substantial part
of its property or business without its consent and shall not be discharged with- in sixty (60) days after such appointment; or 

(f)                  
 Any governmental agency or any court of competent jurisdiction at the in- stance of any governmental agency shall assume
custody or control of the whole or any substan- tial portion of the properties or assets of the Company; or 

(g)                 
 One or more money judgments, writs or warrants of attachment, or similar process, in excess of fifty thousand dollars ($52,632)
in the aggregate, shall be entered or filed against the Company or any of its properties or other assets and shall remain unpaid,
unvacated, unbonded or unstayed for a period of fifteen (15) days or in any event later than five (5) days prior to the date of
any proposed sale thereunder; or

failed to cure such default within the appro- priate grace period; or 

(i)                   
 The Company shall have its Common Stock delisted from an exchange (including the OTC Markets exchange) or, if the Common

file its 1934 act reports with the SEC; 

(j)

(k)

Then, or at any time thereafter,
unless cured within 5 days, and in each and every such case, un- less such Event of Default shall have been waived in writing by
the Holder (which waiver shall not be deemed to be a waiver of any subsequent default) at the option of the Holder and in the Holder's
sole discretion, the Holder may consider this Note immediately due and payable, with- out presentment, demand, protest or (further)
notice of any kind (other than notice of accelera- tion), all of which are hereby expressly waived, anything herein or in any note
or other instru- 

ments contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, and the Holder may immediately, and without expiration of any period of grace, enforce any and all of the Holder's
rights and remedies provid- ed herein or any other rights or remedies afforded by law. Upon an Event of Default, interest shall
accrue at a default interest rate of 24% per annum or, if such rate is usurious or not permit- ted by current law, then at the
highest rate of interest permitted by law. In the event of a breach 

 of Section 8(k) the penalty
shall be $250 per day the shares are not issued beginning on the 4 th  

 day after the conversion
notice was delivered to the Company. This penalty shall increase to 

 $500 per day beginning on
the 10 th  day. The penalty for a breach of Section 8(n) shall be an in- 

 crease of the outstanding
principal amounts by 20%. In case of a breach of Section 8(i), the out- standing principal due under this Note shall increase by
50%. If this Note is not paid at maturity, the outstanding principal due under this Note shall increase by 10%. Further, if a breach
of Sec- tion 8(m) occurs or is continuing after the 6 month anniversary of the Note, then the Holder shall be entitled to use the
lowest closing bid price during the delinquency period as a base price for the conversion. For example, if the lowest closing bid
price during the delinquency period is 

 $0.01 per share
and the conversion discount is 50% the Holder may elect to convert future con- versions at $0.005 per share. 

If the Holder shall commence
an action or proceeding to enforce any provisions of this Note, in- cluding, without limitation, engaging an attorney, then if
the Holder prevails in such action, the Holder shall be reimbursed by the Company for its attorneys  fees and other costs
and expenses incurred in the investigation, preparation and prosecution of such action or proceeding. 

Make-Whole
for Failure to Deliver Loss. At the Holder s election, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the conversion
shares by the by the 3rd business day following the delivery of a Notice of Conversion to the Company and if the Holder incurs
a Failure to Deliver Loss, then at any time the Holder may provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to
the Holder in respect of the Failure to Deliver Loss and the Company must make the Holder whole as follows: 

 Failure to Deliver Loss
= [(High trade price at any time on or after the day of exercise) x (Num- ber of conversion shares)] 

The Company must pay the Failure
to Deliver Loss by cash payment, and any such cash payment must be made by the third business day from the time of the Holder s
written notice to the Com- pany. 

9.                  
 In case any provision of this Note is held by a court of competent jurisdic- tion to be excessive in scope or otherwise
invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be ad- justed rather than voided, if possible, so that it is enforceable to the
maximum extent possible, and the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Note will not in any way be affected
or impaired thereby. 

10.              
 Neither this Note nor any term hereof may be amended, waived, dis- charged or terminated other than by a written instrument
signed by the Company and the Holder. 

11.              
 The Company represents that it is not a  shell  issuer and has never been a  shell  issuer or that
if it previously has been a  shell  issuer that at least 12 months have passed since the Company has reported form
10 type information indicating it is no longer a  shell issu- er. The Company will instruct its counsel to either (i) write
a Rule 144 or similar opinion to al- low for salability of the conversion shares or (ii) accept such opinion from Holder s
counsel, provided such legal opinion is, in the reasonable determination of Company counsel, factually and legally correct. 

12.            
 The Company shall issue irrevocable transfer agent instructions reserving 65,000,000 shares of its Common Stock for conversions
under this Note (the  Share Reserve ). Upon full conversion of this Note, any shares remaining in the Share Reserve
shall be cancelled. The Company shall pay all costs associated with issuing and delivering the shares. If such amounts are to be
paid by the Holder, it may deduct such amounts from the Conversion Price. Conversion Notices may be sent to the Company or its
transfer agent via electric mail. The com- pany should at all times reserve a minimum of three times the amount of shares required
if the note would be fully converted. The Holder may reasonably request increases from time to time to reserve such amounts. The
Company will instruct its transfer agent to provide the outstanding share information to the Holder in connection with its conversions. 

13.              
 The Company will give the Holder direct notice of any corporate actions, including but not limited to name changes, stock
splits, recapitalizations etc. This notice shall be given to the Holder as soon as possible under law. 

14.              
 This Note shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of New York applicable to contracts made and wholly
to be performed within the State of New York and shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of each party hereto. The Holder
and the Company hereby mutually waive trial by jury and consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the courts of the State
of New York or in the Federal courts sitting in the county or city of New York. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts,
and the facsimile transmission of an executed counterpart to this Agreement shall be effective as an original. 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the
Company has caused this Note to be duly execut- ed by an officer thereunto duly authorized.
