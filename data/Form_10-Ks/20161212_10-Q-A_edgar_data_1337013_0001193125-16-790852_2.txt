    EXPLANATORY NOTE    
 On November 1, 2016, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. (the  Company ) concluded, after
review and discussion with management, that the Company s audited financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and the Company s unaudited financial statements for each of the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2015
through June 30, 2016 (collectively, the  Financial Statements ) should no longer be relied upon. This Amendment No. 1 to the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this  Form 10-Q/A ) for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2016, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on August 10, 2016 (the  Original Form 10-Q ), restates the Company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2016, and amends the related Notes and disclosures thereto, including the Company s controls and procedures. The impact on the Company s financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015,
is to increase the provision for contractual allowance (thereby reducing accounts receivable as shown on the balance sheet) and other items as follows:      
   The impact of these amounts are included in the following items on the Company s condensed consolidated
financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:

to the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on December 12, 2016 for additional details.    The items amended
in the Original Form 10-Q are listed under  Items Amended by this Filing  below. Other than the  Items Amended by this Filing , disclosures in the Original Form 10-Q remain unchanged. However, for the convenience of the
reader, this Form 10-Q/A restates in its entirety, as amended, the Company s Original Form 10-Q. The Company has not modified or updated disclosures presented in the Original Form 10-Q, except as required to reflect the effects of the
restatement. Accordingly, this Form 10-Q/A does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original Form 10-Q and no attempt has been made in this Form 10-Q/A to modify or update other disclosures as presented in the Original Form 10-Q,
except as specifically referenced herein. Accordingly, this Form 10-Q/A should be read in conjunction with the Company s filings with the SEC subsequent to the filing of the Original Form 10-Q.  
   Background of Restatement    
 The calculation error affects only the Company s rentals of infusion pumps to patients, which are paid for by third-party insurance
payors. Revenue resulting from sales, service and rentals directly billed to health care providers is not impacted by this calculation error.  
 A summary of the restatement and its effects to the Company s financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively, included within this Form 10-Q/A, is presented in Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.  
   Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
 Under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management
conducted a reassessment of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016. As a result of that reassessment, management concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not
effective due to a material weakness.    For a description of the material weakness, see Part I   Item IV   Controls and
Procedures.

    NOTES TO THE UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

1.  
  Basis of Presentation, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     
 The terms  InfuSystem ,  the Company ,  we ,  our  and  us  are used herein to refer to
InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. is a leading provider of infusion pumps and related services. The Company services hospitals, oncology practices and other alternative site healthcare
providers. Headquartered in Madison Heights, Michigan, the Company delivers local, field-based customer support, and also operates pump repair Centers of Excellence in Michigan, Kansas, California, Texas, Georgia and Ontario, Canada.  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information. Accordingly, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, composed of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary by
management to fairly state the Company s results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or
for the full year. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and Notes thereto included in the Company s Amendment No. 2 to its  Annual
Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC.    The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements are prepared in conformity with GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities at the reporting date and the amounts of revenue and expenses in the periods
presented. The Company believes that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original
estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods.      

2.  
  Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements       Subsequent to the
filing of the Company s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 with the SEC on August 10, 2016, management identified historical accounting errors principally related to a calculation error resulting in
an overstatement of estimated accounts receivable collections. Due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which the Company operates, certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at
their net realizable value. Accounts receivable are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients, third-party payors and other direct pay customers for goods provided and services rendered. The Company performs periodic analyses to
assess the accounts receivable balances. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowance (to reduce gross billed charges to a contractual or estimated net realizable value from third-party payors) based on
management s assessment of historical and expected estimated collectability of the accounts such that the recorded amounts reflect estimated net realizable value. Upon determination that an account is uncollectible, the account is written-off
and charged to the allowance for doubtful accounts for patients or the contractual allowance for third-party payors. The Company s allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowance are a reduction to accounts receivable on the
Company s consolidated financial position. Additions to the contractual allowance each period offset gross billed charges, which are not publicly reported in the Company s filings, to arrive at net revenue, which is publicly reported in
the Company s consolidated results of operations. Additions to the allowance for doubtful accounts, however, impact the bad debt expense line item of the Company s consolidated results of operations. The Company discovered that it has been
applying an incorrect cash collection percentage due to a calculation error when calculating the historical collection percentage from certain billings to third-parties. This calculation error resulted in an overstatement of historical cash
collection percentages from this revenue, which was then used to estimate future cash collections relative to an outstanding accounts receivable balance.  
 The calculation error affects only the Company s rentals of infusion pumps to patients, which are paid for by third-party insurance
payors. Revenue resulting from sales, service and rentals directly billed to health care providers is not impacted by this calculation error.  
 The impact on the Company s financial statements for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 is to increase the provision
for contractual allowance (thereby reducing accounts receivable as shown on the balance sheet):

3.  
  Business Combination       On April 20, 2015 (the  Closing Date ), the Company
acquired substantially all of the assets of Ciscura Holding Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( Ciscura ) for $6.2 million in cash, based on the final number of pumps acquired and the associated treatments, which were generated during the
90-day period post-closing from the approximately 100 medical facility relationships Ciscura had prior to the acquisition. The Company acquired approximately 1,800 infusion pumps, its four-person field sales team, as well as its facilities
management personnel, which have become the foundation of the Company s new Southeast facility. Ciscura, based in Alpharetta, GA, was a privately-held Southeastern regional provider of ambulatory infusion pumps and services to medical
facilities and provides the Company with a new regional warehouse and service facility that are in close proximity to a number of our largest existing customers, in addition to new customers previously serviced by Ciscura, enabling same day service
for equipment and supplies to much of the Southeast region. The Company used available borrowings under its Credit Facility to finance the acquisition and associated expenses.  
  Final Purchase Price Allocation   
 Pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 805, Business Combinations ,  the final purchase price was allocated to
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values as of the Closing Date. The final purchase price allocation was primarily based upon a valuation using income and cost approaches and management s estimates and
assumptions. The allocation of the final purchase price to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the Closing Date is presented below (in thousands):  
   
   Acquired property and equipment are being depreciated on a straight-line basis with estimated remaining lives
ranging from 1 year to 7 years.

   Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information   
 The unaudited pro forma financial information in the table below summarizes the combined results of operations of the Company and Ciscura as
though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2015. The pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of
operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the period presented nor is it indicative of future results. The Company did not disclose the revenue and income of Ciscura separately as it is not
practical due to the fact that the operations are substantially integrated. The following pro forma financial information presented also includes the pro forma depreciation and amortization charges from acquired tangible and intangible assets, and
related tax effects for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 (in thousands):

  Medical Equipment and Property       Medical equipment consisted of the following as of June
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):      
   Depreciation expense for medical equipment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.6 million
and $3.1 million, respectively, compared to $1.1 million and $2.1 million for the same prior year periods, which was recorded in cost of revenues   pump depreciation and disposals, for each period.  
 Depreciation expense for property and equipment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.1 million and $0.3 million,
respectively, compared to $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the same prior year periods. This expense was recorded in general and administrative expenses.

  Intangible Assets       The carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets
as of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are as follows (in thousands):      
   Amortization expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 was $0.9 million and $1.8 million,
respectively, compared to $0.7 million and $1.3 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. Expected annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded as of June 30, 2016, is as follows (in thousands):  

On March 23, 2015, the Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (the
 Borrowers ) entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as lender (the  Lender ). The Credit Agreement consists of a $27.0 million Term Loan A, up to an $8.0 million
Term Loan B and a $10.0 million revolving credit facility (the  Revolver ), all of which mature on March 23, 2020 (collectively, the  Credit Facility ).  
 On March 23, 2015, the Borrowers drew $27.0 million under the Term Loan A to repay and terminate the previously existing credit facility under
the credit agreement dated November 30, 2012, as amended, by and among the Company, its direct and indirect subsidiaries, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and certain lenders party thereto (the  WF
Facility ). As of June 30, 2016, Term Loan B had a balance of $5.9 million. As of June 30, 2016, interest on the Credit Facility is payable at the

Borrower s choice as a (i) Eurodollar Loan, which bears interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 2.00% to 2.50% or (ii) CBFR Loan, which bears interest at a per
annum rate equal to (a) the Lender s prime rate or (b) LIBOR for a 30-day interest period plus 2.50%, in each case, plus a margin ranging from -0.75% to -0.25%. The actual rate at June 30, 2016 was 2.95% (LIBOR of 0.45% plus 2.50%) on both
Term Loan A and B and 3.25% (JPM Chase Prime Rate of 3.5% less 0.25%) on the Revolver.    The availability under the Revolver is based upon
the Borrowers  eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory and is comprised as follows (in thousands):      
   To secure repayment of the obligations of the Borrowers, each Borrower has granted to the Lender, for the
benefit of various secured parties, a first priority security interest in substantially all of the personal property assets of each of the Borrowers. In addition, the Company has pledged the shares of InfuSystem Holdings USA, Inc.
( Holdings USA ) and Holdings USA has pledged the shares of each of InfuSystem, Inc. and First Biomedical, Inc. and the equity interests of IFC, LLC to the Lender, for the benefit of the secured parties, to further secure the obligations
under the Credit Agreement.    In addition, the Credit Agreement requires the Borrowers to maintain the following financial covenant
obligations:      

(iii) 
 a minimum net worth of $37.5 million.      The restatement error and the Company s decision
to prepay debt, would have resulted in the Company being non-compliant with its fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of March 31, 2016, however, as of June 30, 2016, the Company would have been in compliance. As a result of the Company s
restatement of prior consolidated financial statements described herein, the following Events of Default occurred:      

(i) 
 an Event of Default that results from breach of the Fixed Charge Coverage covenant as of March 31, 2016 as required under Section 6.12(b); and    

(ii) 
 an Event of Default that results from the unintentional misrepresentations made prior to the date of the First Amendment in connection with the certification as to the accuracy of the financial statements and compliance
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 as they relate solely to the source of the error that has necessitated the restatement discussed herein.    
 In order to cure these violations, the Company entered into the First Amendment to Credit Agreement and Waiver on December 5, 2016. This
First Amendment amends the Credit Agreement in the following material respects:      

(i) 
 a waiver of the Event of Default that results from the failure to timely deliver the unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 as required under Section 5.01(b) and (c);

(ii) 
 a waiver of the Event of Default that results from breach of the Fixed Charge Coverage covenant as of March 31, 2016 as required under Section 6.12(b);    

(iii) 
 a waiver of the Event of Default that results from the unintentional misrepresentations made prior to the date of the First Amendment in connection with the certification as to the accuracy of the financial statements
and compliance certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 as they relate solely to the source of the error that has necessitated the restatement discussed herein;    

(iv) 
 a restructuring of the credit facility that will effectively consolidate Term Loan A and Term Loan B into a single Term Loan resulting in a new total drawn amount of $32 million under the Term Loan with the

  Income Taxes       During the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company recorded
income tax benefit of $0.1 million and tax expense of $0.1 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0.1 million and an income tax benefit of $0.3 million,
respectively. During the quarter, the Company recognized a benefit from research and development credits ( R D Credits ) of $0.3 million pertaining to its development of software that enables third parties to interact, initiate
functions or review data on the Company s system. In computing its income tax provision, the Company estimates its effective tax rate for the full year and applies that rate to income earned through the reporting period. The Company s
effective income tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was 21.5%.

  Commitments, Contingencies and Litigation       From time to time in the ordinary course of
its business, the Company may be involved in legal proceedings, the outcomes of which may not be determinable. The Company has insurance policies covering potential losses where such coverage is cost effective. The Company is not, at this
time, involved in any legal proceedings that the Company believes could have a material effect on the Company s financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

  Earnings Per Share       Basic income per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted income per share assumes the issuance of potentially dilutive shares of common stock during the period. The following table reconciles the numerators and
denominators of the basic and diluted income per share computations:      
   For the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, less than 0.1 million of stock options were not included in
the calculation because they would have an anti-dilutive effect, compared to 0.1 million for the same prior year periods.      
   The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the date of
issuance for the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of June 30, 2016.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements and Developments       In April 2015, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-03, Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs ( ASU 2015-03 ),
and, in August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest   Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs
Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting ( ASU 2015-15 ). ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-15 then clarified that debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement can be presented as an asset on the balance sheet, regardless of whether there are
any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. These ASUs are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and for interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this guidance as of January
1, 2016, and as a result, has recast the December 31, 2015 consolidated balance sheet to conform to the current period presentation. The adoption of this standard reduced previously presented other assets and long-term debt by $0.1 million,
based upon the balance of unamortized debt issuance costs relating to its Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015.

  On May 28, 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
( ASU 2014-09 ), which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will supersede the existing revenue recognition
guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, deferring the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year, from
January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018. The Company plans to adopt ASU 2014-09 on January 1, 2018. The Company is evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and/or disclosures
and has not yet selected a transition method.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU
2016-02 ). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance
for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the financial statements to assess the amount, timing
and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For public companies, ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period, and requires a modified
retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact, if any, that the adoption of this guidance will have on its financial position, results of operations, cash flows and/or disclosures.

other risk factors as discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in other filings made by the Company from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission
( SEC ). Our Amendment No. 2 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A is available on the SEC s EDGAR website at  www.sec.gov , and a copy may also be obtained by contacting the Company. All forward-looking statements made
in this Form 10-Q/A speak only as of the date of this report. We do not intend, and do not undertake any obligation, to update any forward-looking statements to reflect future events or circumstances after the date of such statements, except as
required by law.     All of the financial information presented in this Item 2 has been revised to reflect the restatement of our
consolidated financial statements, as more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-Q/A   
  Overview     We are a leading provider of
infusion pumps and related services. We service hospitals, oncology practices and other alternative site healthcare providers. Headquartered in Madison Heights, Michigan, we deliver local, field-based customer support, and also operate
Centers of Excellence in Michigan, Kansas, California, Texas, Georgia and Ontario, Canada.    We supply electronic ambulatory infusion pumps
and associated disposable supply kits to oncology practices, infusion clinics and hospital outpatient chemotherapy clinics. These pumps and supplies are utilized mostly by colorectal cancer patients who receive a standard of care treatment that
utilizes continuous chemotherapy infusions delivered via electronic ambulatory infusion pumps. Our products and services are also utilized by patients in other disease states such as pancreatic, esophageal, stomach, and other head and neck and
gastro intestinal tract cancers, as well as in the management of post-operative pain. We obtain an assignment of insurance benefits from the patient, bill the insurance company or patient accordingly, and collect payment. We provide pump
management services for the pumps and associated disposable supply kits to over 1,700 cancer therapy sites in the United States, and except in rare circumstances where the patient has met a payment cap, retain title to the pumps during this process.
   We sell or rent new and pre-owned pole mounted and ambulatory infusion pumps to, and provide biomedical recertification, maintenance and
repair services for, oncology practices as well as other alternative site settings including home care and home infusion providers, skilled nursing facilities, pain centers and others.  
 Additionally, we sell, rent, service and repair new and pre-owned infusion pumps and other medical equipment. We also sell a variety of
primary and secondary tubing, cassettes, catheters and other disposable items that are utilized with infusion pumps. Our rental and sales revenues come from three different revenue streams: provider to patient, supplier to supplier, and
supplier to provider.    Since 2013, we have made significant investments in our Information Technology ( IT ). These efforts
have primarily been focused on increasing electronic connectivity with our customers via electronic medical integration, pump portal, and asset tracking. Since 2014, we have invested in supporting uses of our ambulatory pumps in pain management
for outpatient orthopedic surgeries utilizing continuous peripheral nerve block and collecting patient pain scores.

   Recent Developments   
  CMS     On April 25, 2016,
CMS released the Medical Learning Network ( MLN ) Matters Number SE1609  Medicare Policy Clarified for Prolonged Drug and Biological Infusions Started Incident to a Physician s Service Using an External Pump  clarification
article ( SE1609 ). This clarification article is intended for all physicians and hospital outpatient departments submitting claims to Medicare Administrative Contractors ( MACs ) for prolonged drug and biological infusions
started incident to a physician s service using an external pump. It should be noted that this article does not apply to suppliers  claims submitted to Durable Medical Equipment ( DME ) MACs. 
 We interpret SE1609 as no longer permitting DME suppliers to submit billings to the DME MACs for the infusion pumps and supplies provided to
Medicare patients in the circumstances described in SE1609. More particularly, SE1609 provides that when a drug is provided  incident to  physicians  services rendered to patients while in the physician s office or hospital
outpatient department, the external pump is not separately billable as DME. This applies to any DME supplier, home infusion company, hospital outpatient clinic or physician office that provides ambulatory infusion pumps in a setting where
treatment is initiated in the infusion setting prior to the patient being sent home for long term infusion. SE1609 states that an ambulatory infusion pump and supplies are not separately reimbursable as DME when a Medicare patient leaves an
infusion setting and goes home with a pump. SE1609 indicates that the administration of the drug billed to the local Medicare Contractor should also include payment for the DME used in furnishing the service. Under existing laws, in order
for Medicare to cover the cost of the drug and external pump, a physician, hospital, clinic, home infusion therapy company or DME supplier must incur a cost for the drug and pump.  
 We have historically submitted billings directly to DME MACs for our infusion pumps and portfolio of related services in the circumstances
described above. In this regard, Medicare accounted for 18% and 19% of our total revenues for the six-month period ended June 30, 2016 and fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, and 21% and 23% of our consolidated accounts
receivable, net as of June 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015, respectively. As a result of SE1609, we will now submit these billings, effective July 1, 2016, directly to physicians or hospitals who, in turn, will seek reimbursement from
Medicare. In these cases, the providing physicians or hospitals, rather than Medicare, will be the primary obligor to us for payments for our infusion pumps and portfolio of related services.  
 It is important to note that SE1609 applies only to Medicare patients and, therefore, we currently expect that SE1609 will have no direct
material impact on the majority of patients of our customers who are insured by private commercial carriers. In these cases, which currently represent a substantial majority of our revenues, we already submit billings directly to these private
commercial carriers.    We estimate that the transition to the alternative direct billing arrangement and other recent announcements
regarding commercial billing will in aggregate have a gross reduction to our net revenue due exclusively to the pricing impact of approximately $1.3 million per quarter. However, our response to this change as well as the expected changes in the
competitive dynamics in the marketplace stemming from this change could mitigate this decline in revenue. These include:      

In the near term, we are aligning processes with the new billing model, which we expect to reduce costs;        

In the near term, we expect our asset utilization to normalize;        

In the intermediate term, we are pursuing additional strategies to further improve financial performance, including (i) conducting new analyses to identify facilities which may have unreported treatments, and (ii)
implementing cost savings initiatives;        

In the long term, SE1609 will not only impact us, but will reshape the entire market, which we expect to create additional opportunities; and    

Our on-going third-party payor contracting effort has resulted in several contracts which we expect to materially improve collections on billings to these payors.    
 The ultimate impact of SE1609 will vary as we make internal changes in the short-term and as the market is reshaped in the long term. We
believe that the reduction in revenue resulting from the pricing decrease could ultimately be mitigated by 2018 through our response as well as potential benefits gained from the competitive changes in the marketplace.  
 In addition to restoring profitability, we are committed to achieving the accelerated reduction of debt outstanding through dramatically
reduced capital investment in both IT systems and pump fleet.    Finally, however, there can be no assurance that SE1609 and the associated
competitive dynamics in the marketplace will not further impact future revenues and net income or implicate other risks referred to in the Risk Factors section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for 2015. The estimates provided above are our best
estimates of future events that may or may not be obtainable and there can be no assurance that we will achieve such results.  
  InfuSystem Holdings, Inc. Results of Operations for the Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Compared to the Three and Six Months Ended
June 30, 2015      Net Revenues   
 Our net revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were $18.1 million, an increase of $1.2 million, or 7%, compared to $16.9 million for the
quarter ended June 30, 2015. During the period, net revenues from rentals increased $0.9 million, or 6%, compared to the same prior year period. Our restatement resulted in a decrease in net revenues and rentals of $0.7 million compared to
the prior year period. Net revenues from product sales were $1.9 million, an increase of $0.3 million compared to the same prior year period. 
 Our net revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2016 were $36.4 million, an increase of $3.0 million, or 9%, over the same prior year
period. During the period, net revenues from rentals increased $2.4 million, or 8%, compared to the same prior year period. Our restatement impacted net revenues and rentals with a decrease of $1.3 million compared to the same prior year
period. The remaining increase in net revenues for both 2016 periods can be attributed to greater rental volume with new and existing sites of therapy, partially offset by a higher mix of Medicaid and patient payors in our rental business, which
generally have lower net revenue rates than commercial payors.

   Gross Profit   
 Gross profit for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was $11.1 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, or 4%, compared to $11.6 million for the
quarter ended June 30, 2015. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenues, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was 61%, down from 69% for the same prior year period partially due to our restatement that resulted in a decrease in gross profit
of $0.7 million compared to the prior year period. The remaining decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the period was largely attributed to an increase of $1.7 million in supply costs and depreciation.  
 Gross profit for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $23.7 million, an increase of $0.2 million, or 1%, compared to the six months ended
June 30, 2015. Gross profit, as a percentage of net revenues, for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was 65%, down from 70% for the same prior year period partially due to our restatement of revenue that directly impacted gross profit with no
associated costs, resulting in a decrease of $1.3 million compared to the same prior year period. The remaining decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for the period was largely due to the increase of $2.8 million in supply costs
and depreciation associated with the increase in rental revenues and the deployment of pumps to new therapy sites.     Provision for
Doubtful Accounts     Provision for doubtful accounts for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was $1.1 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or
7%, compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The provision for doubtful accounts was 6% of net revenues at June 30, 2016, compared to 7% for the same prior year period. This change is the result of the Company s increased number
of third-party payor contracts that are now being billed at in-network rates with lower rates of bad debt whereby previous insurance billings were billed at higher out-of-network rates with higher rates of bad debt. Bad debt is primarily associated
with rental revenues.    Provision for doubtful accounts for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $2.8 million, an increase of $0.5
million, or 20%, compared to $2.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The provision for doubtful accounts was 7% of net revenues at June 30, 2016, which was consistent with the same prior year period. This increase is due (i)
mainly to a change in a payor that was billing the Company as in-network without a contract to out-of-network, thereby resulting in an increase in bad debt and the Company has recently signed a contract with this payor whereby the billing will
resort back to in-network; and (ii) a higher mix of Medicaid and patient payors in our rental business, which generally have higher uncollectible rates than commercial payors.  
  Amortization of Intangible Assets   
 Amortization of intangible assets for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 was $0.9 million, an increase of $0.2 million compared to the same prior
year period. Amortization of intangible assets for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.8 million, an increase of $0.5 million compared to the same prior year period. These increases were largely attributable to the intangible assets
acquired from our Ciscura acquisition and the completion of several IT projects that were placed into service and the resulting amortization.  
  Selling and Marketing Expenses   
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, selling and marketing expenses were $2.3 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 14%, compared to $2.7
million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, selling and marketing expenses were $5.1 million, a decrease of $0.3 million, compared to $5.4 million for the same prior year period. These decreases
were largely attributable to reductions in sales and marketing personnel costs. Selling and marketing expenses during these periods consisted of sales personnel salaries, commissions and associated fringe benefit and payroll-related items,
marketing, share-based compensation, travel and entertainment and other miscellaneous expenses.     General and Administrative Expenses
    During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, General and Administrative ( G A ) expenses were $6.4 million, an increase of
$0.4 million, or 7%, from $6.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. The increase in G A expenses versus the same prior year period was mainly attributable to increases in spending on IT of $0.9 million and decreases in stock
compensation expense and professional fees of $0.5 million. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, G A expenses were $13.1 million, an increase of 9%, from $12.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The increase in G A
expense versus the same prior year period was mainly attributable to increases in spending on IT and Pain Management initiatives of $1.1 million.  
  Other Income and Expenses   
 During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we recorded interest expense of $0.3 million, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 16%, compared to $0.4
million for the same prior year period. During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded interest expense of  
      20  

Table of Contents  

$0.6 million, a decrease of $0.4 million, or 40%, compared to $1.0 million for the same prior year period. This is a direct result of the lower interest rates with our new Credit Facility,
which we entered into on March 23, 2015, consisting of a $27.0 million Term Loan A, up to an $8.0 million Term Loan B and a $10.0 million revolving credit facility (the  Revolver ), all of which mature on March 23, 2020, collectively (the
 Credit Facility ). In addition, during the six months ended June 30, 2015, we had other expenses of $1.6 million, primarily related to the write-off of deferred financing costs as a result of the early extinguishment of debt.  
  Income Taxes     During the
three and six months ended June 30, 2016, we recorded income tax benefit of $0.1 million and a tax expense of $0.1 million, respectively. During the period, our restatement resulted in an income tax benefit of $0.3 million. During the three and
six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $0.1 million and a tax benefit of $0.3 million, respectively. During the period, our restatement resulted in an income tax benefit of $0.5 million. Our effective income tax
rate for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was 21.5%.     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 As of June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.8 million and $3.3 million of net availability under the Revolver compared to $0.8
million of cash and cash equivalents and $9.9 million of net availability under our Revolver at December 31, 2015.   As of June 30,
2016, the Company has prepaid its Term Loan A principal payments due on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016. Each of these payments is approximately $1.0 million, representing a total prepayment of $1.9 million.  
 Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $1.9 million compared to cash provided by operating
activities of $3.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is mainly due to increases in accounts receivable and decreases in other current liabilities.  
 Cash used in investing activities was $5.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 compared to cash used of $11.4 million for the six
months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in cash used was due to $3.8 million of cash used during the six months ended June 30, 2015 related to our Ciscura asset acquisition. The Company has spent approximately $2.5 million on Information
Technology capital projects for the year. There was also a decrease in spending on non-pump assets of $0.1 million and a $0.9 million increase in cash used to purchase medical equipment.  
 Cash proceeds in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $3.5 million compared to cash proceeds of $7.9 million for
the six months ended June 30, 2015. This decrease is primarily attributable to the cash proceeds received as a result of our decision to refinance our debt in the first quarter of 2015.  
 The availability under the Revolver is based upon our eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory and is computed as follows (in
thousands):      
   Our Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and shares of our subsidiaries and
requires us to comply with covenants, including but not limited to, financial covenants relating to the satisfaction, on a quarterly and annual basis for the duration of the Credit Facility, of a total leverage ratio, a fixed charge coverage ratio
and a net worth level. As a result of the restatement described in Note 6, the following Events of Default occurred:      

(i) 
 an Event of Default that results from breach of the Fixed Charge Coverage covenant as of March 31, 2016 as required under Section 6.12(b); and    

(ii) 
 an Event of Default that results from the unintentional misrepresentations made prior to the date of the First Amendment in connection with the certification as to the accuracy of the financial statements and compliance
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 as they relate solely to the source of the error that has necessitated the restatement discussed herein.    
 In order to cure these violations, we entered into the First Amendment to Credit Agreement and Waiver on December 5, 2016. This First
Amendment amends the Credit Agreement in the following material respects:      

(i) 
 a waiver of the Event of Default that results from the failure to timely deliver the unaudited financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 as required under Section 5.01(b) and (c);

(ii) 
 a waiver of the Event of Default that results from breach of the Fixed Charge Coverage covenant as of March 31, 2016 as required under Section 6.12(b);    

(iii) 
 a waiver of the Event of Default that results from the unintentional misrepresentations made prior to the date of the First Amendment in connection with the certification as to the accuracy of the financial statements
and compliance certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 as they relate solely to the source of the error that has necessitated the restatement discussed herein;    

(iv) 
 a restructuring of the credit facility that will effectively consolidate Term Loan A and Term Loan B into a single Term Loan resulting in a new total drawn amount of $32 million under the Term Loan with the
approximately $5 million excess over the current aggregate drawn amounts under Term Loan A and Term Loan B to be available to reduce the Company s drawings under the revolving credit line;    

(v) 
 set the maturity of the new Term Loan described in item (iv) and the revolving credit line to five years from the effective date of the First Amendment;    

(vi) 
 set the quarterly mandatory principal payment due on the Term Loan to $1.3 million due on the last business day of each fiscal quarter with any remaining unpaid and outstanding amount due at maturity;    

(vii) 
 amend the deadline for delivery of consolidated financial statements to allow for the delivery of such statements for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 by December 16, 2016;    

(viii) 
 amend the deadline for delivery of the Company s annual financial plan and forecast to 30 days after the end of each fiscal year;    

(x) 
 amend the definition of EBITDA to provide for the exclusion of certain one-time expenses directly related to the financial restatement described herein;    

(xi) 
 amend Section 8.01(a) to replace references to  Jonathan Foster  with  Christopher Downs .    
 As a result of the waivers of Events of Default contained within the First Amendment to Credit and Waiver Agreement described in Note 6 to the
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as of June 30, 2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants and expect to remain in compliance for the next 12 months.  
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which require the use of estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods
presented. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to inherent uncertainties in making estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring
adjustments to these balances in  
      21

future periods. The critical accounting estimates that affect the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those
described in the MD A section in our annual report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures        Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements
    An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer
and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016. The evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures by our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer included a review of the restatement described in the filing of this Form 10-Q/A and the Amendment No. 2 to our Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, where we restated our consolidated balance sheet, consolidated
statements of operations consolidated statements of cash flows, and notes to our consolidated financial statements. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and
procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2016 at the reasonable assurance level, to enable us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules or forms due to the material weakness described below.     Material Weakness in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting     A material weakness is defined as a deficiency or combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with the restatement of our condensed consolidated
financial statements and revised management s assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting at December 31, 2015, and evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of June 30, 2016, we identified a material weakness in
our internal control over financial reporting associated with a calculation error in our statistical method of calculating collectible accounts receivable and corresponding revenue.  
 Specifically, the Company did not design and maintain effective internal control over the assessment of the accounting for significant
estimates associated with collections of accounts receivable and corresponding revenue. This material weakness resulted in the restatement described in Note 2 of our prior period financial statements including the years ended December 31, 2015 and
the interim periods therein and the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016, which is included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q/A, and September 30, 2016 (three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 only). Additionally, this
material weakness could result in a misstatement in the financial statements that would result in a material misstatement in the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
 Other than the material weakness as set forth above during the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there have been no changes in our internal controls
over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act, during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 identified in connection with our evaluation that has materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.     Management s Remediation Initiatives   
 We have taken, and continue to take, the actions described below to remediate the identified material weakness. As we continue to evaluate and
work to improve our internal controls over financial reporting, our senior management may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or modify the remediation efforts, or in appropriate circumstances not to complete,
certain of the remediation measures described in this section. While the Audit Committee and senior management are closely monitoring the implementation, until the remediation efforts discussed in this section, including any additional remediation
efforts that our senior management identifies as necessary, are completed, tested, and determined effective, the material weakness described above will continue to exist.  
 To address this material weakness, our management has implemented new procedures and internal controls surrounding the use of our statistical
method of calculating collections of accounts receivable and corresponding revenue. These include, but are not limited to, simplifying the calculation to reduce potential opportunities for error; establishing a more formalized process of review for
the calculation by members of the Company s senior management, including establishing key controls and control design, and implementing a quarterly review of the estimated receivables collection calculation against other possible
quantitative/qualitative methods to validate conclusions.

   PART II OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item 1. Legal Proceedings   
 We are, from time to time, a party to legal proceedings that may arise in the ordinary course of our business. Currently, there are no
legal proceedings that management believes would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.      
 Item 1A. Risk Factors     For information regarding factors that could affect our results of operations, financial condition and
liquidity, refer to the section entitled  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015.  
 Except as updated below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A
for the year ended December 31, 2015 as filed with the SEC.      We have restated our prior consolidated financial statements, which may lead to
additional risks and uncertainties, including loss of investor confidence, stockholder litigation and negative impacts on our stock price.    
 As discussed in Note 3 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data of our Form 10-K/A, we have restated our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 and for each of the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2015 through June 30, 2016 (the  Restated Periods ).
The determination to restate the financial statements for the Restated Periods was made by our Audit Committee upon management s recommendation following the identification of errors principally related to an overstatement of estimated accounts
receivable collections. Due to the errors, our management concluded that the Company s previously issued financial statements for the Restated Periods should no longer be relied upon.  
 As a result of these events, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including unanticipated costs for accounting
and legal fees in connection with or related to the restatement. We are also the subject of stockholder litigation that has been filed relating to the restatement. We may incur additional substantial defense costs regardless of the outcome of such
litigation. Likewise, such events might cause a diversion of our management s time and attention. If we do not prevail in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs. In addition, the restatement may
lead to a loss of investor confidence and have negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock.      Our business is substantially dependent
on estimates of collectible revenue from third-party reimbursement.      Our revenues are substantially dependent on estimates of
collectible revenue from third-party reimbursement. Due to the complex nature of third-party reimbursement for the use of continuous infusion equipment and related disposable supplies provided to patients, we must estimate, based upon historical
averages, the amount of collectible revenue that may be derived from each patient treatment. If average reimbursement diverges from historical levels, the estimates of such revenue may diverge from actual collections.  
 We utilize statistical methods to account for such changes, but there can be no assurance that the revenue reported in any period will
ultimately be collected. Any recognized revenue related to third-party reimbursement from prior periods, which remains uncollected until written off from accounts receivable, will negatively impact revenues in the period in which it is written off.
Thus, over time, recognized revenue net of bad debt expense will approximate total collections.      We have identified a material
weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which has and in the future could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements.    
 We are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over its financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and
15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. As disclosed in Item IV of Part I of this Form 10-Q/A and Item 9A of Part II in our Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on December 12, 2016. we identified a material weakness in our internal control over
financial reporting related to a calculation error in our statistical method of calculating collectible accounts receivable and corresponding revenue. A material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal
control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of this material weakness, our
management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the last day of the period covered by this Form 10-Q/A.  
      24  

Table of Contents  

  We are actively engaged in developing a remediation plan designed to address this material
weakness. As disclosed in Item IV of Part I of this Form 10-Q/A because of the material weakness identified by the Company, our consolidated financial statements contained material misstatements that required restatement of the Company s
financial results in this report. We have taken, and continue to take, the actions discussed in Item 4 - Controls and Procedures - Management s Remediation Initiatives of this Form  10-Q/A.  As we continue
to evaluate and work to improve our internal controls over financial reporting, our senior management may determine to take additional measures to address control deficiencies or modify the remediation efforts described in this report. While
the Audit Committee and senior management are closely monitoring the implementation, until the remediation efforts discussed in this report, including any additional remediation efforts that our senior management identifies as necessary, are
completed, tested, and determined effective, the material weakness described in this report could continue to exist. If in the future, the measures are insufficient to address the material weakness or if additional material weaknesses or significant
deficiencies in the internal control are discovered or occur in the future, the consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely
affect the Company s business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict its ability to access the capital markets, require the Company to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject it to
fines, penalties or judgments, harm its reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.      Our business is
substantially dependent on third-party reimbursement. Any change in the overall health care reimbursement system may adversely impact our business.    
 Our revenues are substantially dependent on third-party reimbursement. We are paid directly by private insurers and governmental
agencies, often on a fixed fee basis, for the use of continuous infusion equipment and related disposable supplies provided to patients. If the average fees allowable by private insurers or governmental agencies were reduced, the negative
impact on revenues could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Also, if amounts owed to us by patients and insurers are reduced or not paid on a timely basis, we may be required to
increase our bad debt expense and/or decrease our revenues. Additionally, any regulatory changes that restrict our ability to seek reimbursement for DME, including, but not limited to SE1609, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.    Changes in the health care reimbursement system often create
financial incentives and disincentives that encourage or discourage the use of a particular type of product, therapy or clinical procedure. Such changes may be impacted by the growth in ACOs, reduction of providers by payors, the use of lower cost
rental networks and other factors. Market acceptance of continuous infusion therapy may be adversely affected by changes or trends within the health care reimbursement system. Changes to the health care reimbursement system that favor
other technologies or treatment regimens that reduce reimbursements to providers or treatment facilities, including increasing competitive pressures from home health care and other companies that use our services, may adversely affect our ability to
market our services profitably. Overall, such dependency and potential changes could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  
 For additional information pertaining to CMS, refer to Item 1   Business   Significant Customers and Recent Events in Our
Business included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015.      Covenants in our current and any future debt
agreement restrict our business.      Our Credit Agreement contains, and the agreements that govern our future indebtedness may
contain, covenants that restrict our ability to and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:      

engage in a transaction that results in a change of control, as defined by the Credit Agreement governing the Credit Facility;        

create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any lien upon any of our property, assets or revenues;        

make certain investments or acquisitions;        

create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any indebtedness;        

merge, dissolve, liquidate, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets;        

make any disposition or enter into any agreement to make any disposition;        

repurchase outstanding stock from the open market; and        

declare or make, directly or indirectly, any dividend or other restricted payment, or incur any obligation (contingent or otherwise) to do so.    
 These covenants may restrict our ability to operate our business. Our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an Event of
Default that, if not cured or waived, could result in reduced liquidity for the Company and could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, our ability to pay
interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations, generate sufficient cash flows to service such debt and the other factors discussed in this section. Our Credit Agreement also
contains certain financial covenants.  
      25  

Table of Contents  

  As a result of the restatement described herein, the following Events of Default occurred:  

(i) 
 an Event of Default that results from breach of the Fixed Charge Coverage covenant as of March 31, 2016 as required under Section 6.12(b); and    

(ii) 
 an Event of Default that results from the unintentional misrepresentations made prior to the date of the First Amendment in connection with the certification as to the accuracy of the financial statements and compliance
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 as they relate solely to the source of the error that has necessitated the restatement discussed herein.    
 The restatement error disclosed in this Form 10-Q/A and our decision to prepay our term loan debt, have resulted in the Events of Default
described above. With respect to the fixed charge coverage ratio, we were non-compliant for the three months ended March 31, 2016, with a ratio of 1.16:1.00. Excluding our optional prepayment of term loan debt, our fixed charge coverage ratio
would have been 1.60:1.00. As a result of the waivers of Events of Default contained within the First Amendment to Credit and Waiver Agreement described in Note 6 to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, as of June 30,
2016, we were in compliance with all such covenants and expect to remain in compliance for the next 12 months.       Item
