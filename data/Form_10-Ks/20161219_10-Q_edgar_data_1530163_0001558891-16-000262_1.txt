NOTE
1 - GENERAL  

Darkstar
Ventures, Inc. ( the Company  or  we ) was incorporated on May 8, 2007 under the laws of the State of
Nevada.   

The
Company established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Israel, Bengio Urban Renewals Ltd ( Bengio )., to focus its limited
resources in the area of real estate development, particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in Israel.  

The
Company s activities are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, including failing to secure additional funding
to operationalize the Company s current business plan.  

NOTE
2 - INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of October 31, 2016 and for the three months then ended, have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States relating to the preparation of
financial statements for interim periods. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required for annual
financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary
for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three months ended October 31, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending July 31, 2017.  

The
July 31, 2016 Condensed Balance Sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures
required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements should be read
in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended July 31, 2016.  

NOTE
3   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
significant accounting policies applied in the annual financial statements of the Company as of July 31, 2016, are applied consistently
in these financial statements.

NOTES
TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited)  

NOTE
4 - GOING CONCERN   

The
Company has not commenced planned principal operations. The Company had an accumulated deficit of $647,171 as of October 31, 2016.
In addition, the Company continues to have negative cash flows from operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the
Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

There
can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that
funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional
capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force
the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business.
Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that
they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company s existing stockholders.  

The
accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of asset-carrying
amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
5 - NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS:   

No
new accounting standards have been adopted since the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July
31, 2016 was filed.  

NOTE
6 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS:   

As
of October 31, 2016 other current assets includes loans to an officer of the Company in the amount of $34,961. The loan is due
on demand with no interest.  

NOTE
7 - COMMON SHARES:   

On
April 14, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company has approved the issuance of 150,000,000 restricted shares under a subscription
agreement with investors for total consideration of $150,000. During the period ended October 31, 2016, the Company received $120,000
of such subscription amounts.  

NOTE
8 - LONG-TERM LOAN:   

On
February 28, 2016, Bengio and TCSM INC signed a loan agreement according to which TCSM would grant the Company a loan of up to
$256,016 (NIS 1,000,000) in two installments of which $222,048 (NIS 850,000) was received as of the balance sheet date. The loan
bears interest at an annual rate of 25%. The principal and interest will be repaid at March 1, 2019.  

On
February 28, 2016 TCSM INC assigned its rights in the above loan agreement to a third party. The loan is secured by Avraham Bengio,
the Company's majority holder of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock and its Sole Director, CEO and CFO in an amount

Forward-Looking
Statements    

The
following discussion should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this
Form 10-Q (the   Report  ). This Report contains forward-looking statements which relate to future events or our future

that may cause our or our industry   s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements.  

Corporate
Background and Business Overview    

We
were incorporated on May 8, 2007 in the State of Nevada. We are a development stage company that was originally established to
offer eco-friendly health and wellness products to the general public via the internet. As we had previously disclosed, on November
20, 2012, we entered into a binding letter of intent ( LOI ) with Real Aesthetic, Inc., a Nevada corporation ( Real
Aesthetic ), to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for common stock of the Company.
The closing of the transactions contemplated by the LOI was subject to the completion of the due diligence investigation of both
parties, execution and delivery of documentation for the transaction, consents from the respective boards of directors of both
companies and any third parties and the delivery of audited financial statements by Real Aesthetic. Subsequently, we decided not
to pursue the contemplated transaction with Real Aesthetic. The Company has since abandoned its business plan.  

The
Registrant has recently determined, through its recently established, wholly-owned new Israeli subsidiary, Bengio Urban Renewals
Ltd to focus its limited resources in the area of real estate development, particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in
Israel. We believe, based upon the current real estate market in Israel, that urban renewal projects present an opportunity for
us to generate revenues and profits, which we have never experienced since our inception.  The basis for our belief is that
in several major Israeli cities, there is virtually no more room to grow. As a result, several municipal governments have allowed
older buildings to be renovated, thereby giving their respective cities the opportunity to develop new apartments to be added
to or replacing existing buildings.   

Additionally,
municipalities have express their concern that many buildings constructed before 1980 will be unable to withstand earthquakes.
In Israel, very few apartment buildings are owned by a single person or entity and since the majority of apartments within buildings
are privately owned, the burden to renovate buildings in order to render them safer in the event of a major earthquake primarily
falls on the multiple owners of various apartment buildings and complexes.   

Tama
38  is an Israeli national zoning plan whereby a contractor assumes the responsibility of renovating an apartment building.
In exchange for covering all costs of renovations, securing building permits and paying requisite taxes, the contractor has is
granted the right to build additional floors to the existing building and sell the apartments built on these floors.   

The
apartment owners benefit by receiving a modernized building, strengthened against earthquakes, as well as the additional apartments
added to their buildings. In some cases balconies, storage rooms, parking spaces and elevators may be added as well, further enhancing
the building s value.  

PinuiBinui 
projects are defined as development where the residents of apartments are temporarily evacuated so that the buildings may be demolished
and rebuilt.  The tenants then return to new apartments in the newly finished and renovated building.  The contractor
pays all costs for demolition, construction, relocating apartment owners and renting their temporary homes during construction. 
In exchange, the contractor adds new apartments in the building which are sold to generate profit.  

As
with  Tama 38,  the value of the apartments in the building is increased thereby benefitting the owners and the tenants
return to a new, often larger and safer apartment in a building often with more amenities.  

Since
February 2016, the Registrant s Board of Directors authorized the establishment of a new  wholly-owned Israeli
subsidiary, Bengio Urban Renewals Ltd ( Bengio Urban ) to focus its limited resources in the area of real estate development,
particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in Israel. To that end, the Registrant raised $150,000 from the sale of restricted
shares to investors to fund the new real estate development operations of Bengio Urban, which has recently hired employees
and has signed contracts with the current tenants of three buildings who have agreed to vacate the buildings so that they can
be redeveloped into modern state of the art new residential buildings .  

On
February 16, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company and the holder of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of
common stock of the Company (the  Majority Consenting Stockholder ), together, executed a joint written consent to authorize
and approve a Certificate of Amendment to the Company's Articles of Incorporation to increase the authorized capital stock of
the Company from 505,000,000 shares (the  Capital Stock ), consisting of 500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value
$0.0001 (the  Common Stock ) and 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 (the  Preferred Stock ),
to an authorized capital stock of the Corporation of 2,005,000,000 shares consisting of 2,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock and
five million 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock. It was also decided that the Board of Directors shall have the authority to
establish one or more series of Preferred Stock and fix relative rights and preferences of any series of Preferred Stock, without
any further action or approval of our stockholders.  

Other
than our current director and officer, we have no employees October 31 2016 .  

Transfer
Agent    

We
have engaged Vstock Transfer LLC, 77 Spruce Street, Suite 201, Cedarhurst, NY, 11516 as our stock transfer agent. Their telephone
number is (212) 828-8436 and their fax number is (646) 536-3179. The transfer agent is responsible for all record-keeping and
administrative functions in connection with our issued and outstanding common stock.  

Results
of Operations   

Results
of operations for the three months ended October 31 2016   

The
Company did not generate any revenues from operations for the three months ended October 31 2016  

During
the three months ended October 31 2016 the operating expenses and the net loss was $31,802 and $48,046 respectively. The operating
expenses and net loss was primarily the result of professional fees, legal, auditing and other consulting fees associated with
SEC compliance and operating expenses in the subsidiary from its commencement of its business activities .  

We
expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses. As a result, we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve
profitability, which may not occur. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability
on a quarterly or annual basis in the future.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

Our
cash balance as of October 31 2016 was $34,540. The Company is currently seeking to raise additional equity thru private placements
to enable the continuation of its current TAMA 38 business plan ..  

Going
Concern Consideration    

Our
auditors have issued an opinion on our annual financial statements which includes a statement describing our going concern status.
This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain
additional capital to pay our bills and meet our other financial obligations. This is because we have not generated any revenues
and no revenues are anticipated until we begin marketing the product which cannot be guaranteed.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital
resources that are material to investors.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.   

A
smaller reporting company, as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, is not required to provide the information required by this
item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

The
Company's Chief Executive Officer, who is also the Chief Financial and Accounting Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period
covered by this quarterly report. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that
any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the
desired control objectives, and our management is required to apply their judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship
of possible controls and procedures. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO  concluded that, as of October 31 2016 , the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.   As a result of this evaluation,
management identified the following deficiencies, which are deemed to be material weaknesses:  

Due to the size of the Company, there is a lack of segregation of duties, which would allow for proper processing, review
        and approval of transactions and events that have an impact on the Company s financial results.  

The Company lacks a system to allow for the review and monitoring of internal control over financial reporting, which
        would mitigate concerns related to management s override of controls.  

The Company lacks an independent Audit Committee, which can provide oversight of management and the financial reporting
        process.    

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There
were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting for the three months ended October 31 2016 that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.
