FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains statements that are not historical facts but rather forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements include those that address activities, events or developments that Autoliv, Inc. ( Autoliv,  the  Company  or  we ) or its management believes or anticipates may occur in the future. All forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements regarding the expected consummation of the joint venture with Volvo Cars, management s examination of historical operating trends and data as well as estimates of future sales, operating margin, cash flow, effective tax rate or other future operating performance or financial results are based upon our current expectations, various assumptions and/or data available from third parties. Our expectations and assumptions are expressed in good faith and we believe there is a reasonable basis for them. However, there can be no assurance that such forward-looking statements will materialize or prove to be correct as forward-looking statements are inherently subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause actual future results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the future results, performance or achievements expressed in or implied by such forward-looking statements. 
 In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as  estimates,   expects,   anticipates,   projects,   plans,   intends,   believes,   may,   likely,   might,   would,   should,   could,  or the negative of these terms and other comparable terminology, although not all forward-looking statements contain such words. 
 Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, the outcome could differ materially from those set out in the forward-looking statements for a variety of reasons, including without limitation: changes in light vehicle production; fluctuation in vehicle production schedules for which the Company is a supplier; changes in and the successful execution of our capacity alignment, restructuring and cost reduction initiatives and the market reaction thereto; changes in general industry and market conditions or regional growth or decline; loss of business from increased competition; higher raw material, fuel and energy costs; changes in consumer and customer preferences for end products; customer losses; changes in regulatory conditions; customer bankruptcies; consolidations or restructuring or divestiture of customer brands; unfavorable fluctuations in currencies or interest rates among the various jurisdictions in which we operate; component shortages; costs or difficulties related to the integration of any new or acquired businesses and technologies; continued uncertainty in pricing negotiations with customers; successful integration of acquisitions and operations of joint ventures; our ability to be awarded new business; product liability, warranty and recall claims and investigations and other litigation and customer reactions thereto (including the resolution of the ongoing Toyota Recall (defined below)); higher expenses for our pension and other postretirement benefits including higher funding requirements for our pension plans; work stoppages or other labor issues; possible adverse results of pending or future litigation or infringement claims; our ability to protect our intellectual property rights; negative impacts of antitrust investigations or other governmental investigations and associated litigation relating to the conduct of our business; tax assessments by governmental authorities and changes in our effective tax rate; dependence on key personnel; legislative or regulatory changes impacting or limiting our business; political conditions; dependence on and relationships with customers and suppliers; and other risks and uncertainties identified in Item 1A  Risk Factors  in our Form 10-K and Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on February 19, 2016. 
 For any forward-looking statements contained in this or any other document, we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and we assume no obligation to update publicly or revise any forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events, except as required by law.

     1 Basis of Presentation 
 The accompanying interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the prior year audited financial statements and all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included in the financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The result for the interim period is not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period or for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. 
 The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. 
 Statements in this report that are not of historical fact are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that could affect the actual results of the Company. A description of the important factors that could cause Autoliv's actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this report may be found in this report and Autoliv's other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements, footnotes and definitions thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2016. 

2 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which provides guidance on eight cash flow classification issues and thereby reducing the current and potential future diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company plans to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact for any periods presented. 
 In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13) , which requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for public companies during the fiscal year 2020, and earlier adoption is permitted during the fiscal year 2019. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718) , which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any entity in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected term should be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. The Company plans to adopt this standard prospectively as of January 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  , to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about   leasing arrangements. Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exceptions. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after   December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those annual periods. Early application is permitted for all entities. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements, which will require right   of use assets and lease liabilities be recorded in the consolidated balance sheet for operating leases.  
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740) , which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes. The amendments in this Update require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The amendments in this Update apply to all entities that present a classified statement of financial position. The current requirement that deferred tax liabilities and assets of a tax-paying component of an entity be offset and presented as a single amount is not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The amendments in this Update may be applied either prospectively to all deferred tax liabilities and assets or retrospectively to all periods presented. The Company early adopted the standard prospectively in its interim reporting for March 31, 2016. The impact of the change on the consolidated condensed balance sheet was approximately $70 million reclassified from current deferred tax assets to non-current deferred tax assets and approximately $20 million reclassified from current deferred tax liabilities to non-current deferred tax liabilities. 
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) , which will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard was originally to be effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), that defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for all entities by one year. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which is an amendment that clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as in Topic 606. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating which adoption method to use and assessing the potential impact the new standard and the related Updates will have on its operations and consolidated financial statements. 
 In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330) , which requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. Subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using LIFO or the retail inventory method. For public business entities, this Update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments in this Update should be applied prospectively with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company plans to adopt this standard as of January 1, 2017. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact for any periods presented. 
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30) , simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this Update. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the amendments in this Update is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. An entity should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period information that has been retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items (that is, debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability). The Company adopted the standard in its interim reporting for March 31, 2016. The effect of the change on the balance sheet as of March 31, 2016 was $1.7 million reclassified from debt issuance cost asset to the debt liability. Prior period information was not retrospectively adjusted as the effects of the adoption of ASU 2015-03 were not material to those periods.

3 Business Combinations 
 Autoliv-Nissin Brake Systems 
 On March 31, 2016, the Company acquired a 51% interest in the entities that formed Autoliv-Nissin Brake Systems (ANBS) for approximately $263 million in cash. ANBS designs, manufactures and sells products in the brake control and actuation systems business. Nissin Kogyo retained a 49% interest in the entities that formed ANBS. The Company has management and operational control of ANBS and has consolidated the results of operation and balance sheet from ANBS from the date of the acquisition forward. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination. 
 The acquisition combines Nissin Kogyo's world leading expertise and technology in brake control and actuation systems with Autoliv's global reach and customer base to create a global competitive offering in the growing global brake control systems market. ANBS will also further strengthen the Company s role as a leading system supplier of products and systems for autonomous driving vehicles. ANBS is included in the Electronics segment. From the date of the acquisition through September 30, 2016, the ANBS business reported net sales of $278 million and a net loss attributable to controlling interest of $3 million, net of a loss attributable to the non-controlling interest of $3 million. The operating loss from the date of the acquisition through September 30, 2016 included $0.9 million of purchase accounting inventory fair value step-up adjustments in cost of sales upon the sale of acquired inventory. The total purchase accounting inventory fair value step-up adjustments included in the balance sheet at the acquisition date were $0.9 million. 
 Total ANBS acquisition related costs were approximately $3.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and approximately $2.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and were reflected in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income. 
 The pro forma effects of this acquisition would not materially impact the Company's reported results for any period presented. 
 The preliminary acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for the Company s 51% interest in the entities that formed ANBS was $262.8 million in a cash transaction. 
 The following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of March 31, 2016: 
 Amounts preliminary recognized as of acquisition date March 31, 2016 (in millions) 

Acquired Intangibles primarily consist of the fair value of customer contracts of $64.9 million and certain technology of $64.1 million. The customer contracts will be amortized straight-line over 7 years and the technology will be amortized straight-line over 10 years. 
 10 

The recognized goodwill of $217.8   million reflects expected synergies from combining Autoliv's global reach and customer base with Nissin Kogyo's world leading expertise (including workforce) and technology in brake control and actuation systems. A significant portion of the goodwill is d  eductible for tax purposes.  
 The fair values recognized for the acquired assets, assumed liabilities and goodwill are preliminary pending finalization of valuation process. 

4 Fair Value Measurement 
 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
 The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, other current liabilities and short-term debt approximate their fair value because of the short term maturity of these instruments. 
 The fair value of the contingent consideration relating to the M/A-COM acquisition in August 2015 is re-measured on a recurring basis (for further information, see the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 19, 2016). As of September 30, 2016, there was no material change in the fair value of this contingent consideration. 
 The Company uses derivative financial instruments,  derivatives , as part of its debt management to mitigate the market risk that occurs from its exposure to changes in interest and foreign exchange rates. The Company does not enter into derivatives for trading or other speculative purposes. The Company s use of derivatives is in accordance with the strategies contained in the Company s overall financial risk policy. The derivatives outstanding at September 30, 2016 were foreign exchange swaps and forward contracts. All swaps principally match the terms and maturity of the underlying debt and no swaps have a maturity beyond six months. The foreign exchange forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of certain external purchases. All derivatives are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value. Certain derivatives are from time to time designated either as fair value hedges or cash flow hedges in line with the hedge accounting criteria. For certain other derivatives, hedge accounting is not applied either because non-hedge accounting treatment creates the same accounting result or the hedge does not meet the hedge accounting requirements, although entered into applying the same rationale concerning mitigating market risk that occurs from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates. 
 When a hedge is classified as a fair value hedge, the change in the fair value of the hedge is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income along with the off-setting change in the fair value of the hedged item. When a hedge is classified as a cash flow hedge, any change in the fair value of the hedge is initially recorded in equity as a component of Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) and reclassified into the Consolidated Statements of Net Income when the hedge transaction affects net earnings. The Company uses the forward rate with respect to the measurement of changes in fair value of cash flow hedges when revaluing foreign exchange forward contracts. There were no material reclassifications from OCI to the Consolidated Statements of Net Income during the first nine months of 2016. Any ineffectiveness in the first nine months of 2016 was not material. 
 The Company s derivatives are all classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and there have been no transfers between the levels during this or comparable periods. 
 11 

The tables below present information about the Company s financial assets   and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The carrying value is the same as the fair value as these instruments are recognized in the consolidated financial statements at fair value. Althou  gh the Company is party to close-out netting agreements (i.e. ISDA agreements) with all derivative counterparties, the fair values in the tables below and in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2016 and in the Consolidated Balance She  et at December 31, 2015, have been presented on a gross basis. The amounts subject to netting agreements that the Company chose not to offset are presented below. According to the close-out netting agreements, transaction amounts payable to a counterparty   on the same date and in the same currency can be netted.

Derivatives designated as hedging   instruments  
 The derivatives designated as hedging instruments outstanding at September 30, 2016 were foreign exchange forward contracts, classified as cash flow hedges. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the cumulative gains and losses recognized in OCI on the cash flow hedges were a gain of $1.3 million and a gain of $4.0 million (net of taxes), respectively. The derivatives designated as hedging instruments outstanding at September 30, 2015 were foreign exchange forward contracts, classified as cash flow hedges. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the cumulative gains and losses recognized in OCI on derivative effective portion, net were a gain of $1.4 million and a gain of $1.0 million, respectively. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the gains and losses reclassified from OCI and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income were a gain of $0.1 million and a gain of $0.3 million (net of taxes), respectively. Gains and losses recognized and remaining in OCI as of September 30, 2016 is a gain of $3.8 million (net of taxes). Any ineffectiveness in the first nine months of 2016 was not material. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the gains and losses reclassified from OCI and recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income, net were a gain of $0.2 million and a gain of $0.2 million, respectively. Gains and losses recognized and remaining in OCI as of September 30, 2015 was a gain of $0.8 million (net of taxes). There was no material ineffectiveness recorded during the first nine months of 2015. 
 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments 
 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments relate to economic hedges and are marked to market with all amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income. The derivatives not designated as hedging instruments outstanding at September 30, 2016 were foreign exchange swaps. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company entered into foreign exchange option contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk related to the ANBS acquisition. These foreign exchange option contracts matured during the first quarter of 2016 and are no longer outstanding. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the gains and losses recognized in other non-operating items, net were a loss of $1.3 million and a loss of $0.2 million, respectively, for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments. The derivatives not designated as hedging instruments outstanding at September 30, 2015 were foreign exchange swaps. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the gains and losses recognized in other financial items, net were a gain of $0.6 million and a loss of $1.0 million, respectively, for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments.  For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the gains and losses recognized as interest expense were immaterial. 
 Fair Value of Debt 
 The fair value of long-term debt is determined either from quoted market prices as provided by participants in the secondary market or for long-term debt without quoted market prices, from estimates using a discounted cash flow method based on the Company s current borrowing rates for similar types of financing. The fair value and carrying value of debt is summarized in the table below. The Company has determined that each of these fair value measurements of debt reside within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 

1)    
 
 Debt as reported in balance sheet.    

 Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis 
 In addition to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company also has assets and liabilities in its balance sheet that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis include long-lived assets, including equity method investments. 
 13 

The Company has determined that the fair value measurements included in each of these assets and liabilities rely primarily on Company-specific inputs and the Company s assumptions about the use of the assets and settlements of liabil  ities, as observable inputs are not available. The Company has determined that each of these fair value measurements reside within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. To determine the fair value of long-lived assets, the Company utilizes the projected cas  h flows expected to be generated by the long-lived assets, then discounts the future cash flows over the expected life of the long-lived assets.  
 For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not record any material impairment charges on its long-lived assets. 

5 Income Taxes 
 The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was 26.8% compared to 34.7% in the same quarter of 2015. Discrete tax items, net in the third quarter of 2016 had a favorable impact of 1.1%. In the third quarter of 2015, discrete tax items, net had a favorable impact of 0.4%.  
 The effective tax rate in the first nine months of 2016 was 27.5% compared to 33.9% for the first nine months of 2015. In the first nine months of 2016, the net impact of discrete tax items caused a 0.2% decrease to the effective tax rate.  The net impact of discrete tax items in the first nine months of 2015 caused a 0.6% decrease to the effective tax rate. 
 For the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, the tax rate has been favorably impacted by the mix of earnings in various jurisdictions compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various U.S. state jurisdictions and various foreign jurisdictions. At any given time, the Company is undergoing tax audits in several tax jurisdictions covering multiple years. The Company is no longer subject to income tax examination by the U.S. federal income tax authorities for years prior to 2012.  With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examination by U.S. state or local tax authorities or by non-U.S. tax authorities for years prior to 2009. 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company is not aware of any proposed income tax adjustments resulting from tax examinations that would have a material impact on the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. The conclusion of such audits could result in additional increases or decreases to unrecognized tax benefits in some future period or periods. 
 During the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded a net increase of $2.0 million to income tax reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on tax positions related to the current year, including accruing additional interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of prior years. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company recorded no adjustment to income tax reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of prior years due to the lapse of the applicable statute of limitations. Of the total unrecognized tax benefits of $34.8 million recorded at September 30, 2016, $11.2 million is classified as current tax payable and $23.6 million is classified as non-current tax payable on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. 

6 Inventories 
 Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally FIFO) or market. The components of inventories were as follows: 

14 

7 Good  will  

The goodwill recognized in the first quarter of 2016 was related to the ANBS acquisition (see Note 3). 

8 Restructuring 
 Restructuring provisions are made on a case-by-case basis and primarily include severance costs incurred in connection with headcount reductions and plant consolidations. The Company expects to finance restructuring programs over the next several years through cash generated from its ongoing operations or through cash available under existing credit facilities. The Company does not expect that the execution of these activities will have a material adverse impact on its liquidity position. The majority of restructuring activities relate to the Passive Safety segment. The changes in the employee-related reserves have been charged against Other income (expense), net in the Consolidated Statements of Net Income. 
 Three months ended September 30, 2016 
 The employee-related restructuring provisions and cash payments for the three months ended September 30, 2016 mainly related to headcount reductions in high-cost countries in Europe and Asia. The table below summarizes the change in the balance sheet position of the restructuring reserves from June 30, 2016 to September 30, 2016. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 
 The employee-related restructuring provisions and cash payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 mainly related to headcount reductions in high-cost countries in Europe and Asia.

The table below summarizes the change in the balance sheet position of the restructuring reserves from December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2015. 

9 Product-Related Liabilities 
 The Company has reserves for product risks. Such reserves are related to product performance issues including recall, product liability and warranty issues. For further explanation, see Note 12 Contingent Liabilities below. 
 The table below summarizes the change in the balance sheet position of the product-related liabilities. The provisions and cash paid for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 mainly related to warranty related issues. The provisions and cash paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 mainly related to warranty related issues, while provisions and cash paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 mainly related to recall related issues. 

10 Retirement Plans 
 The Company has contributory and non-contributory defined benefit pension plans covering employees at most operations in the U.S. and in certain other countries. The main plan is the U.S. plan for which the benefits are based on an average of the employee s earnings in the years preceding retirement and on credited service. Certain supplemental funded and unfunded plan arrangements also provide retirement benefits to specified groups of participants. 
 The Company has frozen participation in the U.S. pension plans to include only those employees hired as of December 31, 2003. The U.K. defined benefit plan is the most significant individual non-U.S. pension plan and the Company has frozen participation to include only those employees hired as of April 30, 2003. 
 The Net Periodic Benefit Costs related to Other Post-retirement Benefits were not significant to the condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 and are not included in the table below. 
 The components of total Net Periodic Benefit Cost associated with the Company s defined benefit retirement plans are as follows:

11 Controlling and Non  -Controlling Interest  

12 Contingent Liabilities 
 Legal Proceedings 
 Various claims, lawsuits and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries, covering a range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities with respect to commercial, product liability and other matters. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and the outcome of any litigation cannot be assured. After discussions with counsel, and with the exception of losses resulting from the antitrust proceedings described below, it is the opinion of management that the various legal proceedings and investigations to which the Company currently is a party will not have a material adverse impact on the consolidated financial position of Autoliv, but the Company cannot provide assurance that Autoliv will not experience material litigation, product liability or other losses in the future.

In October 2014, one of the Company s Brazilian subsidiaries received a notice of deficiency from the state tax authorities from the state of S o   Paulo, Brazil which, primarily, alleged violations of ICMS (VAT) payments and improper warehousing documentation. The aggregate assessment for all alleged violations was R$68.5 million (approximately $21.0 million), inclusive of fines, penalties and intere  st. The Company believes the full amount assessed is baseless and that it has reasonable legal and factual defenses to the assessment and, consequently, plans to defend its interests vigorously.   However, the Company believes that a loss is probable with re  spect to at least a portion of the assessed amount and has accrued an   amount in 2015 that was   not material to the Company s results of operations  .   However, the Company cannot predict or estimate the duration or ultimate outcome of this matter.  
 In March 2015, the Company was informed of an investigation being conducted in Turkey by the Directorate of Kocaeli Customs Custody, Smuggling and Enquiry into the Company s import and customs payment structure and the associated import taxes and fees for the period of 2006 2012. The Company cannot predict the duration, scope or ultimate outcome of this investigation and is unable to estimate the financial impact it may have, or predict the reporting periods in which any such financial impacts may be recorded. Consequently, the Company has made no provision for any expenses as of September 30, 2016 with respect to this investigation. 
 ANTITRUST MATTERS 
 Authorities in several jurisdictions are currently conducting broad, and in some cases, long-running investigations of suspected anti-competitive behavior among parts suppliers in the global automotive vehicle industry. These investigations include, but are not limited to, segments in which the Company operates. In addition to pending matters, authorities of other countries with significant light vehicle manufacturing or sales may initiate similar investigations. It is the Company s policy to cooperate with governmental investigations. 
 On June 7-9, 2011, representatives of the European Commission ( EC ), the European antitrust authority, visited two facilities of a Company subsidiary in Germany to gather information for an investigation of anti-competitive behavior among suppliers of occupant safety systems. The investigation is still pending and the Company remains unable to estimate the financial impact such investigation will have or predict the reporting periods in which such financial impact may be recorded and has consequently not recorded a provision for loss as of September 30, 2016. However, management has concluded that it is probable that the Company s operating results and cash flows will be materially adversely impacted for the reporting periods in which the EC investigation is resolved or becomes estimable. 
 In August 2014, the Competition Commission of South Africa (the  CCSA ) contacted the Company regarding an investigation into the Company s sales of occupant safety systems in South Africa. The Company is cooperating with the CCSA. The Company believes that a loss with respect to this investigation is probable and accrued an amount for the period ended June 30, 2016 related to this investigation. Due to further developments with respect to this investigation, the Company accrued an additional amount during the three month period ended September 30, 2016. The aggregate accrued amount remains not material to the Company s results of operations. The Company cannot predict or estimate the duration or ultimate outcome of the CCSA investigation. 
 On July 6, 2015, the Company learned that the General Superintendence of the Administrative Council for Economic Defense ( CADE ) in Brazil had initiated an investigation of an alleged cartel involving sales in Brazil of seatbelts, airbags, and steering wheels by the Company s Brazilian subsidiary and the Brazilian subsidiary of a competitor. The Company believes that a loss in the form of a civil penalty is probable with respect to this matter and accrued an initial amount for the period ended December 31, 2015. Due to further developments with CADE s investigation the Company accrued an additional amount during the period ended March 31, 2016.  The aggregate accrued amount remains not material to the Company s results of operations. The Company cannot predict or estimate the duration or ultimate outcome of this matter. 
 The Company is also subject to civil litigation alleging anti-competitive conduct in the U.S. and Canada. Specifically, the Company, several of its subsidiaries and its competitors were named as defendants in a total of nineteen purported antitrust class action lawsuits filed between June 2012 and June 2015. Fifteen of these lawsuits were filed in the U.S. and were consolidated in the Occupant Safety Systems (OSS) segment of the Automobile Parts Antitrust Litigation, a Multi-District Litigation (MDL) proceeding in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Plaintiffs in the U.S. cases sought to represent four purported classes - direct purchasers, auto dealers, end-payors, and, as of the filing of the last class action in June 2015, truck and equipment dealers - who purchased occupant safety systems or components directly from a defendant, indirectly through purchases or leases of new vehicles containing such systems, or through purchases of replacement parts. 
   In May 2014, the Company, without admitting any liability, entered into separate settlement agreements with representatives of the three classes of plaintiffs then pending in the MDL. Pursuant to the settlement agreements, the Company agreed to pay $40 million to the direct purchaser settlement class, $6 million to the auto dealer settlement class, and $19 million to the end-payor settlement class, for a total of $65 million. This amount was expensed during the second quarter of 2014. In exchange, the plaintiffs agreed that the plaintiffs and the settlement classes would release Autoliv from all claims regarding their U.S. purchases that were or could have been  
 18 

asserted on behalf of the three classes in the MDL. In January 2015, the MDL court granted final approval of the direct purchase  r class settlement, which had been reduced to approximately $35.5 million because of opt-outs; in December 2015, the MDL court granted final approval of the auto dealer class settlement; and on June 20, 2016, the MDL court granted final approval of the end  -payor class settlement, over the objections of several individual class members, some of whom have appealed the MDL court s approval of the Company s end-payor settlement and several other defendants  settlements that were approved at the same time. This   appeal will delay the finality of the Company s settlement with the end-payor class. In addition, several individuals and one insurer (and its affiliated entities) have opted-out of all of the pending end-payor class settlements, including the Company s se  ttlement.   The class settlements do not resolve any claims of settlement class members who opt-out of the settlements or the unasserted claims of any purchasers of occupant safety systems who are not otherwise included in a settlement class, such as states   and municipalities.  
   In September 2016, the insurer (and its affiliated entities) that opted out of the end-payor class settlement filed an antitrust lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, the venue for the MDL, against the Company and the other settling defendants in the end-payor class settlement. The Company has not been served with the lawsuit. The Company cannot predict or estimate the duration or ultimate outcome of this matter. 
 In March 2015, the Company, without admitting any liability, reached agreements regarding additional settlements to resolve certain direct purchasers  global (including U.S.) or non-U.S. antitrust claims that were not covered by the direct purchaser class settlement described above. The total amount of these additional settlements was $81 million. Autoliv expensed during the first quarter of 2015 approximately $77 million as a result of these additional settlements, net of existing amounts that had been accrued in 2014. 
 In April 2016, the Company reached an agreement to settle with the truck and equipment dealers class for a non-material amount. The settlement is subject to court approval following notice to the class and the opportunity for class members to object to or opt-out of the settlement. A final approval hearing is scheduled for November 17, 2016. 
 The remaining four antitrust class action lawsuits are pending in Canada (Sheridan Chevrolet Cadillac Ltd. et al. v. Autoliv, Inc. et al., filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice on January 18, 2013; M. Serge Asselin v. Autoliv, Inc. et al., filed in the Superior Court of Quebec on March 14, 2013; Ewert v. Autoliv, Inc. et al., filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on July 18, 2013; and Cindy Retallick and Jagjeet Singh Rajput v. Autoliv ASP, Inc. et al., filed in the Queen s Bench of the Judicial Center of Regina in the province of Saskatchewan on May 14, 2014). The Canadian cases assert claims on behalf of putative classes of both direct and indirect purchasers of occupant safety systems. On October 13, 2016, the Company reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs in three of the four class actions to settle on a nationwide class basis for an amount that is not material to the Company s results of operations. The settlement is subject to the execution of a formal settlement agreement and court approval following notice to the class members. Once approved, this national settlement will include the claims of the putative members of the fourth class action. The Company accrued amounts during the three month periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016 and an additional amount during the three month period ended September 30, 2016 in connection with these claims. 
 PRODUCT WARRANTY, RECALLS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 Autoliv is exposed to various claims for damages and compensation if products fail to perform as expected. Such claims can be made, and result in costs and other losses to the Company, even where the product is eventually found to have functioned properly. Where a product (actually or allegedly) fails to perform as expected, the Company faces warranty and recall claims. Where such (actual or alleged) failure results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage, the Company may also face product-liability claims. There can be no assurance that the Company will not experience material warranty, recall or product (or other) liability claims or losses in the future, or that the Company will not incur significant costs to defend against such claims. The Company may be required to participate in a recall involving its products. Each vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relating to its suppliers. As suppliers become more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims. Government safety regulators may also play a role in warranty and recall practices. A warranty, recall or product-liability claim brought against the Company in excess of its insurance may have a material adverse effect on the Company s business. Vehicle manufacturers are also increasingly requiring their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. A vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold the Company responsible for some, or all, of the repair or replacement costs of products when the product supplied did not perform as represented by us or expected by the customer. Accordingly, the future costs of warranty claims by the customers may be material. However, the Company believes its established reserves are adequate. Autoliv s warranty reserves are based upon the Company s best estimates of amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims. The Company regularly evaluates the adequacy of these reserves, and adjusts them when appropriate. However, the final amounts actually due related to these matters could differ materially from the Company s recorded estimates. 
 19 

In addition, as vehicle manufacturers increasingly use global platforms and procedures, quality performance evaluations   are also conducted on a global basis. Any one or more quality, warranty or other recall issue(s) (including those affecting few units and/or having a small financial impact) may cause a vehicle manufacturer to implement measures such as a temporary or prol  onged suspension of new orders, which may have a material impact on the Company s results of operations.  
 The Company carries insurance for potential recall and product liability claims at coverage levels based on our prior claims experience. Autoliv cannot assure that the level of coverage will be sufficient to cover every possible claim that can arise in our businesses, now or in the future, or that such coverage always will be available should we, now or in the future, wish to extend, increase or otherwise adjust our insurance. 
 On June 29, 2016, the Company announced that it is cooperating with Toyota Motor Corp. in its recall of approximately 1.4 million vehicles equipped with a certain model of the Company s side curtain airbag (the  Toyota Recall ). Toyota has informed the Company that there have been eight reported incidents where a side curtain airbag has partially inflated without a deployment signal from the airbag control unit. The incidents have all occurred in parked, unoccupied vehicles and no personal injuries have been reported. The root cause analysis of the issue is ongoing.  However, at this point in time the Company believes that a compromised manufacturing process at a sub-supplier may be a contributing factor and, as no incidents have been reported in vehicles produced by other OEMs with the same inflator produced during the same period as those recalled by Toyota, that vehicle-specific characteristics may also contribute to the issue. The sub-supplier s manufacturing process was changed in January 2012, and the vehicles now recalled by Toyota represent more than half of all inflators of the relevant type manufactured before the sub-supplier process was changed. 
 As previously disclosed in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016, the Company determined pursuant to ASC 450 that a loss with respect to this issue is reasonably possible. If the Company is obligated to indemnify Toyota for the costs associated with the Toyota Recall, the Company expects that its insurance will generally cover such costs and liabilities and estimates that the Company s loss, net of expected insurance recoveries, would be less than $20 million.  However, the ultimate costs of the Toyota Recall could be materially different. The main variables affecting the ultimate cost for the Company are: the determination of proportionate responsibility (if any) among Toyota, the Company, and any relevant sub-suppliers; the ultimate number of vehicles repaired; the cost of repair per vehicle; and the actual recoveries from sub-suppliers and insurers. The Company s insurance policies generally include coverage of the costs of a recall, although costs related to replacement parts are generally not covered. 
 In its products, the Company utilizes technologies which may be subject to intellectual property rights of third parties. While the Company does seek to procure the necessary rights to utilize intellectual property rights associated with its products, it may fail to do so. Where the Company so fails, the Company may be exposed to material claims from the owners of such rights. Where the Company has sold products which infringe upon such rights, its customers may be entitled to be indemnified by the Company for the claims they suffer as a result thereof. Such claims could be material. 
 The table in Note 9 Product-Related Liabilities above summarizes the change in the balance sheet position of the product related liabilities for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 

13 Stock Incentive Plan 
 As a result of an initiative to more closely link the Company s stock incentive program to the Company s financial performance, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved a new long-term equity incentive program, pursuant to which performance shares will replace stock options. The first grants under the new long-term incentive (LTI) program were made in February 2016. 
 On February 15, 2016 and May 9, 2016, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted shares under the LTI program pursuant to which certain employees received 50% of their LTI grant value in the form of performance shares and 50% in the form of restricted stock units. The restricted stock units granted on February 15, 2016 and May 9, 2016 will vest in three approximately equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date, subject to the grantee s continued employment with the Company on each vesting date. Additionally, the grantee may earn 0%-200% of the target number of performance shares based on the Company s achievement of specified targets for the Company s compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for sales and the Company s CAGR in earnings per share relative to an established benchmark growth rate. Each performance target is weighted 50% and results are measured at the end of the three-year performance period. 
 20 

The fair value of the restricted stock units and performa  nce shares granted under the LTI program are calculated as the grant date fair value of the shares expected to be issued. The grant date fair value for the restricted stock units at February 15, 2016 and May 9, 2016 was $7.0 million and $0.2 million, respe  ctively. This cost will be amortized straight line over the vesting periods. The grant date fair value of the performance shares at February 15, 2016 and May 9, 2016 was $6.9 million and $0.2 million, respectively, and is based upon the market value of the   Autoliv common stock at the grant date. The performance conditions are not considered in the determination of the grant date fair value for these awards. Compensation expense is recognized over the performance period based on management's estimate of the   number of units expected to vest. Management evaluates its estimate of the actual number of shares expected to be issued at the end of the program on a quarterly basis. The cumulative effect of the change in estimate is recognized in the period of change a  s an adjustment to compensation expense, if necessary.  

14 Earnings per share 
 The Company calculates basic earnings per share (EPS) by dividing net income attributable to controlling interest by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period (net of treasury shares). When it would not be antidilutive (such as during periods of net loss), the diluted EPS also reflects the potential dilution that could occur if common stock were issued for awards under the Company s Stock Incentive Plan. 
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 0.2 million shares of common stock, respectively, were not included in the computation of the diluted EPS, which could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, approximately 0.2 million shares of common stock were not included in the computation of the diluted EPS, which could potentially dilute basic EPS in the future. 
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, approximately 7 thousand and 24 thousand shares of common stock, respectively, from the treasury stock have been utilized by the Company s Stock Incentive Plan. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, approximately 0.1 million and 0.3 million shares of common stock, respectively, from the treasury stock have been utilized by the Company s Stock Incentive Plan. 
 Actual weighted average shares used in calculating EPS were:

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
 The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes thereto included elsewhere herein and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on February 19, 2016. Unless otherwise noted, all dollar amounts are in millions. 
 Autoliv, Inc. ( Autoliv  or the  Company ) is a Delaware corporation with its principal executive offices in Stockholm, Sweden. It was created in 1997 from the merger of Autoliv AB ( AAB ) and the automotive safety products business of Morton International, Inc. The Company functions as a holding corporation and owns two principal subsidiaries, AAB and Autoliv ASP, Inc. 
 Autoliv is a leading developer, manufacturer and supplier of automotive safety systems to the automotive industry with a broad range of product offerings, including passive safety systems and active safety systems. Passive safety systems are primarily meant to improve vehicle safety. Passive safety products include modules and components for passenger and driver-side airbags, side-impact airbag protection systems, seatbelts, steering wheels, whiplash protection systems and child seats, and components for such systems. Active safety systems are designed to assist the driver and ultimately to avoid any crashes by intervening before a collision can occur.   Active safety products include automotive radars, night vision systems, cameras with driver assist systems, positioning systems, passive safety electronics, active seatbelts and brake control systems.

 EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
 The third quarter developed slightly better than the Company s expectations. Growth was in line with the Company s guidance and operating margin was higher than expected with strong growth in Europe and China. 
 Regionally, the light vehicle production growth in China was stronger than expected. Future growth depends, to some extent, on the continuation of government incentives currently in place, but the Company believes in the long term growth prospects in China. In the U.S. market the monthly vehicle sales figures continue to indicate a slowdown in the market, while Europe continues to see high vehicle production levels. Autoliv currently has a healthy product mix in Europe and it outperformed the European vehicle production growth in the quarter by double digit levels.  
 In active safety the Company is now starting to see the lower growth rates that it has indicated for some time. This is due to the ramp down of GPS modules and internally developed brake control products. After the launch of the Company s new active safety products in the beginning of 2016, it has won significant new business. However some of that business has a later expected start of production and additionally some of the business opportunities have not materialized as previously anticipated. Therefore, the Company expects to reach its end of decade sales target in Active Safety about one year later than earlier communicated.  
 The Company continues to have a positive situation in its passive safety business. The historically high order intake continued and the Company is gaining future market share beyond its previous expectations. The Company was able to achieve double digit operating margin in passive safety while deploying additional engineering and other resources to meet this wave of growth that are expected to come from 2018 and onwards.  
 The combined effect of the developments in active and passive safety is further increasing the Company s confidence that it is on the right path to surpass its $12 billion corporate sales target for the end of the decade. This will allow the Company to grow its sustainable market share and further strengthen its technology and market leadership. The Company also continues to monitor the overall macro- and industry situation and is ready to take necessary actions while focusing on executing on its growth strategy with a relentless focus on quality.

THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED WITH THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 
 Market overview 
 Light Vehicle Production Development 

During the three month period from July to September 2016, global LVP is estimated by IHS to have grown by close to 6% compared to the same quarter in 2015. This was in line with IHS's expectation at the beginning of the quarter. 
 25 

In   China  , which accounts for around 16% of Autoliv s sales, LVP grew by close to 24%, more than 7pp better than the July es  timate.  
 In  Japan , which accounts for around 9% of Autoliv s sales, LVP increased by close to 2%, less than 1pp better than the July estimate. 
 In the  RoA , which represents around 9% of Autoliv s sales, LVP declined by 2%, close to 2pp worse than the July estimate. 
 In the  Americas , which accounts for more than one third of Autoliv s sales, LVP was flat, which was close to 3pp worse than in the July estimate. In North America, LVP increased by more than 2%, which was less than 2pp worse than the July estimate. In South America, the decline was close to 11%, close to 8pp worse than the decline expected in IHS s July estimate. 
 In  Europe , where Autoliv currently generates close to one third of its sales, LVP declined by close to 2%, which was close to 2pp worse than IHS s July estimate. In Western Europe, LVP declined by close to 2%, more than 2pp worse than the July estimate. In Eastern Europe, LVP declined by close to 2%, which was in line with the July estimate. 
 Consolidated Sales 
 The Company has substantial operations outside the U.S. and at the present time approximately 73% of its sales are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. This makes the Company and its performance in regions outside the U.S. sensitive to changes in U.S. dollar exchange rates when translated. The measure  Organic sales  presents the increase or decrease in the Company s overall U.S. dollar net sales on a comparative basis, allowing separate discussion of the impacts of acquisitions/divestitures and exchange rate fluctuations and our ongoing core operations and results. The tabular reconciliation below presents the change in  Organic sales  reconciled to the change in the total net sales as can be derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements.

 Consolidated sales increased by close to 13% to $2,461 million compared to $2,185 million in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding negative currency translation effects of less than $1 million and effects from M A activities, the organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) was 6.1%, compared to the organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) of  around 6%  expected at the beginning of the quarter. The organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) was negatively impacted by a strike at a customer in South Korea.

 The organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) of  airbag products  (including steering wheels) was mainly driven by steering wheels in Europe and inflatable curtains in Japan and China. 
 The organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) in  seatbelt products  was a result of strong sales growth in China and Europe, partly offset by South Korea. The trend of higher sales for more advanced and higher value-added seatbelt systems continued globally.  
 Organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) for  passive safety electronics products  (mainly airbag control modules and remote sensing units) grew significantly in China, with both local and global OEMs.  
 The organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) for  active safety products  (automotive radars, night vision systems, cameras with driver assist systems and positioning systems) was driven by sales of radar and camera systems in Europe, particularly to Mercedes and BMW. This was partly offset by lower sales in North America as a result of model transitions and unfavorable mix on slow-selling models.  
 Sales of  Brake control systems  were in line with expectations from the beginning of the quarter.

 Effects from currency translations.    

 The organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) of 6.1% in the quarter was mainly a result of strong growth in China and Europe, where organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) grew by 21% and close to 9% respectively. This was a result of a combination of high content on well performing models and the ramp up of new launches.  
 Sales from Autoliv s companies in  China  grew organically (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) by 21% in the quarter. The growth in the quarter was driven by both global and local OEMs, particularly models from VW, Hyundai/Kia and Great Wall s Haval brand. Sales growth was also supported by strong year-over-year growth in the LVP. 
 Organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) from Autoliv s companies in  Japan  increased by more than 1% in the quarter. The sales increase was mainly due to positive model transitions and ramp ups with models from Toyota. Nissan also contributed to the growth. Lower sales of replacement inflators partly offset the organic growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure). 
 Organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) from Autoliv s companies in the  Rest of Asia (RoA)  declined by 3% in the quarter. This decline was driven by lower sales in South Korea, primarily driven by lower than expected LVP due to a strike at Hyundai/Kia. Strong organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) in India was mainly driven by strong sales for models launched in 2015, particularly from Hyundai and Suzuki. 
 In the  Americas ,   both North and South America saw organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) for the quarter. In North America, the organic sales growth of more than 1% was mainly driven by sales increases for models from Honda, FCA and Hyundai/Kia. Replacement inflators also contributed to the growth. Sales in South America (Brazil) increased by close to 8%, particularly driven by models from FCA, PSA and Renault. 
 The strong organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) of close to 9% in the quarter from Autoliv s companies in  Europe  was driven by increased sales to Mercedes, particularly the new E-Class with high active safety content as well as models from Hyundai/Kia and Renault.

 Assuming dilution and net of treasury shares.    

 The gross profit for the third quarter of 2016 was $495 million, which was $55 million higher than in the same quarter of 2015, as a result of higher sales. The gross margin was unchanged at 20.1% compared to the same quarter of 2015. Favorable effects from currencies and raw material savings were offset by costs related to investments for capacity and growth. 
 Selling, General and Administrative (S,G A) expenses increased by $15 million. 
 Research, Development   Engineering (R,D E) expenses, net, in support of future growth, increased by $35 million compared to the same quarter in the prior year.  
 Operating income increased by $33 million to $191 million, or 7.8% of sales, compared to 7.2% of sales in the same quarter of 2015, when costs related to capacity alignments of $42 million negatively affected the operating margin.  
 Costs of $3 million related to capacity alignments and $5 million related to antitrust matters reduced operating margin by 0.3pp in the third quarter, compared to 2.2pp in the same quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by higher investments for growth.  
 Income before taxes increased by $33 million from the third quarter of 2015. Net Income attributable to controlling interest was $138 million, an increase of $39 million from the third quarter of 2015.  
 The effective tax rate in the third quarter of 2016 was 26.8% compared to 34.7% in the same quarter of 2015. Discrete items, net decreased the tax rate in the quarter by 1.1pp. In the third quarter of 2015, discrete tax items, net had a favorable impact of 0.4pp.  
 Earnings per share (EPS) assuming dilution was $1.56 compared to $1.12 for the same period one year ago. The EPS was positively affected by 34 cents from lower costs related to capacity alignment and 15 cents from a lower underlying tax rate.  
 The weighted average number of shares outstanding assuming dilution was 88.5 million compared to 88.3 million in the third quarter of 2015.

 Market overview 
   
 Light Vehicle Production Development 

For the first nine months of 2016, global LVP is estimated by IHS to have increased by more than 3% compared to the first nine months of 2015. This was essentially flat compared to IHS s expectation from the beginning of the year. 
 In  China , which accounts for around 16% of Autoliv s sales, LVP grew by more than 11%, an increase of close to 3pp compared to the January 2016 estimate.  
 In  Japan ,   which accounts for around 9% of Autoliv s sales, LVP declined by more than 1%, more than 3pp worse compared to the January 2016 estimate. 
 In the  RoA , which accounts for around 9% of Autoliv s sales,   LVP was essentially flat, close to 2pp worse compared to the expectation from the beginning of 2016. 
 In the  Americas , which makes up more than one third of Autoliv s sales, LVP decreased by less than 1%, a decrease of 3pp compared to IHS s growth expectation of more than 2% from the beginning of the year. In North America, the increase was more than 2% compared to the more than 5% expected at the beginning of the year. In South America, the decrease was more than 16%, close to 5pp worse than the January 2016 estimate. 
 In  Europe , where Autoliv currently generates close to one third of its sales, LVP grew by close to 3% which was 1pp better than IHS s estimate in January 2016. In Western Europe, LVP grew by close to 5%, close to 2pp better than estimated at the beginning of the year. In Eastern Europe, LVP decreased by more than 1%, less than 1pp worse than the January 2016 estimate.

 Sales of  airbag products  (including steering wheels) were favorably impacted by higher sales of inflatable curtains, steering wheels and replacement inflators. 
 Sales of  seatbelt products  were particularly strong in Europe. The global trend towards more advanced and higher value-added seatbelt systems continued globally. 
 The growth in organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) for  passive safety electronics products  (mainly airbag control modules and remote sensing units) was due to growth across most regions, particularly in China and North America.  
 The strong increase in sales of  active safety products  (automotive radars, night vision systems, cameras with driver assist systems and positioning systems) resulted from growth particularly for radar related products primarily as a result of Mercedes  increased demand for driving assistance. Sales of camera systems to BMW also contributed. 
 Sales of  Brake control systems  were in line with our expectations from the start of operations of ANBS in the beginning of the second quarter of 2016 .

 For the first nine months of 2016, sales in the Americas represent 34% of total sales, Asia (China, Japan, RoA) 35% and Europe 31%. Sales continue to be balanced across the regions. Growth was particularly strong in Europe and China.  
 Sales from Autoliv s companies in  China  increased organically (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) by close to 15%, particularly driven by Asian and local OEMs. 
 Organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) from Autoliv s companies in  Japan  increased by close to 10%. The increase was primarily driven by models from Toyota, partly offset by lower replacement inflator business.  
 Organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) from Autoliv s companies in the  RoA  grew by close to 3%. The growth was primarily driven by strong sales growth in India and Thailand, partly offset by lower organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) in South Korea. 
  Organic sales  (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above)  from Autoliv s companies in the   Americas   increased by close to 6% and were positively impacted by sales growth in North America primarily driven by sales to Honda, Mercedes, Ford and Nissan. Sales of replacement inflators also contributed.  
 Organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) from Autoliv s companies in  Europe  increased by more than 13%. Models from Hyundai/Kia, Renault, Mercedes, BMW and VW were the largest growth contributors. 
 Earnings 

1)   
 
 Assuming dilution and net of treasury shares.    

 Gross profit for the first nine months of 2016 increased by $199 million, primarily as a result of the higher sales. Gross margin increased by 0.5pp compared to the same period in 2015, mainly as a result of higher organic sales (Non-U.S. GAAP measure), favorable currency effects and raw material savings, partly offset by costs related to investments for capacity and growth.  
 32 

Selling, General and Administrative (S,G A) expenses increased by $47 million.  
 R,D E expenses, net increased by $104 million compared to the same period in the prior year. 
 Operating income increased by $163 million to $609 million. Operating margin was 8.2% for the first nine months of the year, an increase of 1.5pp compared to the same period in the prior year. In 2015 the operating margin was negatively affected by high costs related to the ongoing capacity alignments and for settlements of antitrust related matters.  
 Income before taxes increased by $165 million to $576 million, $2 million more than the increase in operating income.  
 Net income attributable to controlling interest amounted to $419 million compared to $271 million for the first nine months of 2015. Income tax expense was $158 million compared to $139 million in the same period of 2015. The effective tax rate was 27.5% compared to 33.9% for the same nine month period last year. The tax rate was favorably impacted by the geographical mix of earnings compared to the previous year. 
 EPS assuming dilution amounted to $4.74 compared to $3.07 for the same period of 2015. EPS assuming dilution was positively affected by lower capacity alignment and legal costs by $1.21, higher operating income by 28 cents and 44 cents by lower underlying tax rate. These positive effects were partly offset by negative currency translation effects of 8 cents.  
 The weighted average number of shares outstanding assuming dilution was unchanged at 88.4 million compared to the full year 2015. 
 LIQUIDITY AND SOURCES OF CAPITAL 
 As previously announced, the Company has during the quarter refinanced its existing $1.1 billion multi-currency revolving credit facility agreement with a group of fourteen banks. The facility has a five-year maturity, with extension options for up to two more years. 
 Cash flow from operations amounted to $271 million compared to $191 million in the same quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily related to higher net income as well as favorable timing effects from working capital. Operations in the first nine months of 2016 generated $574 million in cash, $145 million more than in the same period in 2015. The increase mainly relates to higher net income, slightly offset by unfavorable timing effects of working capital.    
 Cash flow from operations, less net cash used in investing activities was $153 million compared to negative $34 million during the same quarter of 2015, a difference of $187 million, mainly due to the acquisition of MACOM in Q3, 2015. Cash flow from operations, less net cash used in investing activities was $7 million, this compares to negative $43 million for the same nine months period in 2015. 
 Capital expenditures, net, of $118 million were $21 million more than depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter and $22 million more than capital expenditures during the third quarter of 2015. Capital expenditures net, amounted to $340 million and depreciation and amortization totaled $279 million compared to $334 million and $230 million, respectively, for the same nine months period in 2015. 
  The Company uses the non-U.S. GAAP measure  Operating working capital,  as defined in the table below, in its communications with investors and for management s review of the development of the working capital cash generation from operations. The reconciling items used to derive this measure are, by contrast, managed as part of the Company s overall cash and debt management, but they are not part of the responsibilities of day-to-day operations  management.  
 33 

Reconciliation of  Operating working capital  to U.S. GAAP financial measure  
 (Dollars in millions) 

During the quarter working capital decreased to 17% of  sales from 19% of sales on September 30, 2015 and operating working capital (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) was 6.6% of sales, down 0.3pp compared to September 30, 2015. The Company targets that operating working capital (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) in relation to the last 12-month sales should not exceed 10%.  
 Accounts receivable decreased in relation to sales to 74 days outstanding from 75 days outstanding on June 30, 2016 but increased from 71 days outstanding on September 30, 2015. Days inventory outstanding was 34 days, up from 30 days on June 30, 2016 and from 33 days on September 30, 2015. 
 As part of efficiently managing the Company's overall cost of funds, we routinely enter into "debt-related derivatives" (DRD) as part of our debt management. Creditors and credit rating agencies use net debt adjusted for DRD in their analyses of the Company's debt. DRD are fair value adjustments to the carrying value of the underlying debt. Included in the DRD is also the unamortized fair value adjustment related to a discontinued fair value hedge which will be amortized over the remaining life of the debt. By adjusting for DRD, the total financial liability of net debt is disclosed without grossing debt up with currency or interest fair values. 
 Reconciliation of  Net debt  to U.S. GAAP financial measure 
 (Dollars in millions) 

The Company s gross interest-bearing debt decreased by $11 million during the quarter to $1,545 million at September 30, 2016 and its net debt position (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) decreased by $78 million during the quarter to $360 million at September 30, 2016. During the nine months period ended September 30, 2016, Autoliv s gross interest bearing debt increased by $6 million to $1,545 million compared to December 31, 2015 and its net debt increased during the nine months period ended September 30, 2016, by $158 million to $360 million compared to December 31, 2015. 
 The non-U.S. GAAP measure net debt is also used in the non-U.S. GAAP measure  Leverage ratio . Management uses this measure to analyze the amount of debt the Company can incur under its debt policy. Management believes that this policy also provides guidance to credit and equity investors regarding the extent to which the Company would be prepared to leverage its operations. For details on leverage ratio refer to the table. 
 34 

Calculation of  Leverage ratio   
 (Dollars in millions) 

1)    
 
   Net debt is short- and long-term debt and debt-related derivatives less cash and cash equivalents.    

3)    
 
 Interest expense, net is interest expense including cost for extinguishment of debt, if any, less interest income.    

4)    
 
 Including impairment write-offs, if any.    

 Autoliv s policy is to maintain a leverage ratio (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see calculation above) commensurate with a strong investment grade credit rating. The Company measures its leverage ratio as net debt (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) adjusted for pension liabilities in relation to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). The long-term target is to maintain a leverage ratio of around 1x within a range of 0.5x to 1.5x. As of September 30, 2016 the Company had a leverage ratio of 0.5x. 
 For the first nine months, total equity increased by $569 million to $4,037 million due to $417 million from net income, $253 million from the recognition of a minority interest in ANBS, $37 million from positive currency translation effects and $12 million from common stock incentives. These effects were partly offset by $155 million for dividends.  
 Total parent shareholders  equity was $3,763 million corresponding to $42.66 per share .  
 Headcount 

Compared to June 30, 2016 total headcount (permanent employees and temporary personnel) increased by more than 1,300 people. This was primarily driven by the organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) and the continued hiring of engineers, in both our passive and active safety businesses .  
 SEGMENT DATA 
 The Company reports its results in two segments, Passive Safety and Electronics. Passive Safety includes Autoliv's airbag, seatbelt and steering wheel businesses, while Electronics combines all of Autoliv's electronics resources and expertise in passive safety electronics, active safety and brake control systems into one organization. Corporate sales and income, capital expenditures and depreciation and amortization for the reportable segments can be found in Note 15 Segment Information to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

 Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below.    

 Consolidated sales increased by close to 6% to $1,899 million compared to $1,797 million in the same quarter of 2015. Excluding negative currency translation effects of $3 million, the organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) was also close to 6%. All areas except South Korea showed organic growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) in the quarter. The higher operating margin was primarily a result of high capacity alignment costs in the third quarter of 2015.

 Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table below.    

 During the nine months period consolidated sales increased by 6% to $5,884 million compared to $5,553 million in the same period of 2015. Excluding negative currency translation effects of $115 million, the organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) was 8%. The organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) was primarily driven by higher sales in Europe, China, North America and Japan. In the first nine months of 2015 the reported operating margin for the segment was negatively affected by the antitrust related settlement costs and restructuring costs, primarily related to the on-going European capacity alignment program.

Consolidated sales were significantly higher compared to the same quarter of 2015, primarily due to the inclusion of ANBS. The organic sales growth   (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above)   in Electronics was 8%. The consolidated sales growth   was mainly affected by $140 million from the ANBS joint venture. The lower operating margin was mainly a result of costs relating to the formation of ANBS.

 During the nine months period consolidated sales increased by 45% compared to the same period of 2015. Excluding acquisition effects from ANBS and MACOM of $313 million and negative currency translation effects of $3 million, the organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure, see reconciliation table above) was close to 18%. The lower operating margin was mainly a result of costs relating to the formation of ANBS.

 Headcount 

The total segment headcount increase of more than 1,300 people was primarily driven by the organic sales growth (Non-U.S. GAAP measure) and the continued hiring of engineers, in both our passive and active safety businesses. The total segment headcount increase from December 31, 2015 was mainly due to integration of ANBS into the Electronics segment. Hiring of engineers in our active safety business and in our passive safety business also contributed to the increase.

Ou  tlook  
 Mainly based on our customer call-offs we expect organic sales for the fourth quarter of 2016 to be flat compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Sales from recent M A activities are expected to have a positive effect of around 6%. Currency translations are expected to have a negative effect of less than 1%, resulting in a consolidated sales growth of more than 5%. The fourth quarter of 2016 includes approximately 3 less working days compared to 2015, decreasing the year-over-year organic growth by around 5pp. The adjusted operating margin, excluding costs for capacity alignments and antitrust related matters, is expected to be more than 9%.  
 The indication for the full year is for an organic sales growth of around 7%. Sales from recent M A activities are expected to have a positive effect of around 5%. Currency translations are expected to have a negative effect of more than 1%, resulting in a consolidated sales growth of more than 10%. The adjusted operating margin, excluding costs for capacity alignments and antitrust related matters, is expected to be more than 8.5%. This includes expected integration and purchase accounting related costs for the joint venture with Nissin Kogyo (ANBS) of $20-30 million, as well as costs related to stronger than expected mid-term consolidated sales growth. 
 Since 2015 Autoliv has agreements with several OEMs for new supply capacity for replacement airbag inflators. Based on customer agreements and its own expectations, the Company currently expects deliveries of up to 30 million units during the period 2015 to 2018. It is still too early in this evolving situation to be able to determine final delivery volumes.  
 The projected tax rate, excluding any discrete items, for the full year 2016, is now expected to be around 28% and is subject to change due to any discrete or nonrecurring events that may occur. 
  Operational cash flow for the full year is expected to remain strong and is now expected to be more than $0.8 billion excluding any discrete items.   
  Capital expenditures in support of our growth strategy are expected to be in a range of 5-6% of sales, including capital expenditures for additional capacity for replacement inflators.   
 The forward looking non-U.S. GAAP financial measures above are provided on a non-U.S. GAAP basis. Autoliv has not provided a U.S. GAAP reconciliation of these measures because items that impact these measures, such as costs related to antitrust matters and capacity alignment, cannot be reasonably predicted or determined. As a result, such reconciliation is not available without unreasonable efforts and Autoliv is unable to determine the probable significance of the unavailable information. 
   
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
 CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS 
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company s future contractual obligations have not changed materially from the amounts reported in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on February 19, 2016.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
   ITEM 1.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
 Various claims, litigation and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company or its subsidiaries, covering a range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities with respect to commercial, product liability and other matters. 
 For a description of our material legal proceedings, see Note 12 Contingent Liabilities   Legal Proceedings to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. 
   ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS 
 Except as set forth below, as of September 30, 2016, there have been no material changes to the risk factors that were previously disclosed in Item 1A in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on February 19, 2016. 
 We may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability, warranty and recall claims that may be brought against us or our customers 
 We face risks related to product liability claims, warranty claims and recalls in the event that any of our products actually or allegedly are defective, fail to perform as expected or the use of our products results, or is alleged to result, in bodily injury and/or property damage. For example, we are cooperating with Toyota Motor Corp. with respect to its voluntary safety recall of approximately 1.4 million vehicles that are equipped with a certain model of our side curtain airbags (see Note 12 Contingent Liabilities to our unaudited consolidated financial statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for more information) (the  Toyota Recall ). We may not be able to anticipate all of the possible performance or reliability problems that could arise with our products after they are released to the market. Additionally, increasing regulation and reporting requirements regarding potentially defective products, particularly in the U.S., may increase the possibility that we become involved in additional product liability or recall investigations or claims. See   Our business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety market.  Although we carry product liability and product recall insurance, such insurance may not cover some or all of the entire resulting liability or may not be available in the appropriate markets. Although we have invested and will continue to invest in our engineering, design, and quality infrastructure, we cannot give any assurance that our products will not suffer from defects or other deficiencies or that we will not experience material warranty claims or additional product recalls. In the future, we could experience additional material warranty or product liability losses and incur significant costs to process and defend these claims. 
 40 

The Toyota Recall and any additional future recalls could result in costs not covered by insurance, further government inquiries, litigation, reputational   harm and could divert management s attention away from other matters. The main variables affecting the costs of a recall are the number of vehicles ultimately determined to be affected by the issue, the cost per vehicle associated with a recall, the deter  mination of proportionate responsibility among the customer, the Company, and any relevant sub-suppliers, and actual insurance recoveries. Every vehicle manufacturer has its own practices regarding product recalls and other product liability actions relati  ng to its suppliers, and the performance and remedial requirements vary between jurisdictions. Due to recent recall activity in the automotive industry, some vehicle manufactures have become even more sensitive to product recall risks. As suppliers become   more integrally involved in the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims. Product recal  ls in our industry, even when they do not involve our products, can harm the reputations of our customers, competitors, and us, particularly if those recalls cause consumers to question the safety or reliability of products similar to those we produce.  
 In addition, with global platforms and procedures, vehicle manufacturers are increasingly evaluating our quality performance on a global basis; any one or more quality, warranty or other recall issue(s) (including issues affecting few units and/or having a small financial impact) may cause a vehicle manufacturer to implement measures which may have a severe impact on our operations, such as a global, temporary or prolonged suspension of new orders. In addition, as our products more frequently use global designs and are based on or utilize the same or similar parts, components or solutions, there is a risk that the number of vehicles affected globally by a failure or defect will increase significantly and hence also our costs. A warranty, recall or product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance may have a material adverse effect on our business. Vehicle manufacturers are also increasingly requiring their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. A vehicle manufacturer may attempt to hold us responsible for some or the entire repair or replacement costs of defective products under new vehicle warranties, when the product supplied did not perform as represented. Accordingly, the future costs of warranty claims by our customers may be material. However, the final amounts determined to be due related to these matters could differ materially from our recorded warranty estimates and our financial results may be materially impacted as a result. 
 In addition, as we adopt new technology, we face an inherent risk of exposure to the claims of others that we have allegedly violated their intellectual property rights. We cannot assure that we will not experience any material warranty, product liability or intellectual property claim losses in the future or that we will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. See  If our patents are declared invalid or our technology infringes on the proprietary rights of others, our ability to compete may be impaired . 
 Global integration may result in additional risks 
 Because of our efforts to integrate our operations globally to manage cost, we face the additional risk that, should any of the other risks discussed herein materialize, the negative effects could be more pronounced. For example, while supply delays of a component have typically only affected a few customer models, such a delay could now affect several models of several customers in several geographic areas. Similarly, any recall or warranty issue we face due to a defective product is now more likely to involve a larger number of units in several geographic areas.  For example, the Toyota Recall is currently limited to two vehicle models; however, it is possible that our customer will expand the recall to additional vehicles and we cannot guarantee that other customers will not initiate a recall. 
 Our business may be adversely affected by changes in automotive safety regulations or concerns that drive further regulation of the automobile safety market 
 Government vehicle safety regulations are a key driver in our business. Historically, these regulations have imposed ever more stringent safety regulations for vehicles. These more stringent safety regulations often require vehicles with more safety content per vehicle and more advanced safety products, which has thus been a driver of growth in our business. 
 However, these regulations are subject to change based on a number of factors that are not within our control, including new scientific or medical data, adverse publicity regarding the industry recalls and safety risks of airbags or seatbelts (for instance, to children and small adults), domestic and foreign political developments or considerations, and litigation relating to our products and our competitors  products and more. Changes in government regulations in response to these and other considerations could have a severe impact on our business. Although we believe that over time safety will continue to be a regulatory priority, if government priorities shift and we are unable to adapt to changing regulations, our business may suffer material adverse effects. 
 41 

The regulatory obligation of complying with safety regulations could increase as f  ederal and local regulators impose more stringent compliance and reporting requirements in response to product recalls and safety issues in our industry. We are subject to the existing Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation (TR  EAD) Act, which requires manufacturers to comply with  Early Warning  requirements by reporting to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) information related to defects or reports of injury related to its products. TREAD imposes crimi  nal liability for violating such requirements if a defect subsequently causes death or bodily injury. In addition, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act authorizes NHTSA to require a manufacturer to recall and repair vehicles that contain safet  y defects or fail to comply with federal motor vehicle safety standards. Sales into foreign countries may be subject to similar regulations.  
 Due to the recent record recall of airbag inflators of one of our competitors, additional legislation has been proposed in the U.S. Congress regarding the reporting requirements for product recalls. NHTSA has also become more active in requesting information from suppliers and vehicle manufactures regarding potential product defects. For example, in connection with the Toyota Recall, we, in connection with Toyota, have informed NHTSA of the reported incidents and Toyota has discussed with NHTSA what action it will take to address the issue. If the regulatory obligation of complying with safety regulations increases it could require increased resources and have a material impact on our business. 
 Additional information relating to our environmental management is included in the  Management s Discussion and Analysis Environmental  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on February 19, 2016. 
 Exchange rate risks 
 In addition, as a result of our global presence, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are therefore subject to foreign currency risks and foreign exchange exposure. Such risks and exposures include: 

transaction exposure, which arises because the cost of a product originates in one currency and the product is sold in another currency;     

revaluation effects, which arise from valuation of assets denominated in other currencies than the reporting currency of each unit;     

translation exposure in the income statement, which arises when the income statements of non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars;     

translation exposure in the balance sheet, which arises when the balance sheets of non-U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars; and     

changes in the reported U.S. dollar amounts of cash flows.     

 For example, the financial crisis during 2008-2009 caused extreme and unprecedented volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. More recently, there was significant volatility in certain currency pairs during 2012-2015, and particularly in the early part of 2015. Volatility in certain currency pairs has continued into early 2016 and may impact our financial results. Also, in June 2016, the United Kingdom voted to exit the European Union ("Brexit") in a referendum vote, which caused significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations that resulted in the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Volatility in exchange rates is currently expected to continue in the short term as the United Kingdom (U.K.) negotiates its exit from the European Union. The announcement of Brexit and the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union may also create global economic uncertainty, which may impact, among other things, global light vehicle production. 
 We cannot predict when, or if, this volatility will cease or the extent of its impact on our future financial results. We typically denominate foreign transactions in foreign currencies to achieve a natural hedge. However, a natural hedge cannot be achieved for all our currency flows therefore a net transaction exposure remains within the group. The net exposure can be significant and creates a transaction exposure risk for the Company. Our electronics business is particularly vulnerable to a strong U.S. dollar as certain raw materials and components are sourced in U.S. dollars while sales are also currently in other currencies, like the Euro. The Company does not hedge translation exposure. However, we do engage in foreign exchange rate hedging from time to time related to foreign currency transactions.

 Save as mentioned in paragraph (c) above, a Substitute Affiliate Lender will be treated as a Revolving Credit Lender or a US$ Swingline Lender (as applicable) for all purposes under the Finance Documents and having a Commitment equal to the principal amount of all Designated Loans in which it is participating if and for so long as it continues to be a Substitute Affiliate Lender under this Agreement.    

(e)   
 
 A Designating Lender may revoke its designation of an Affiliate as a Substitute Affiliate Lender by notice in writing to the Facility Agent and the Parent provided that such notice may only take effect when there are no Designated Loans outstanding to the Substitute Affiliate Lender.  Upon such Substitute Affiliate Lender ceasing to be a Substitute Affiliate Lender the Designating Lender will automatically assume (and be deemed to assume without further action by any Party) all rights and obligations previously vested in the Substitute Affiliate Lender.

(f)   
 
        Any Substitute Affiliate Lender or Designating Lender acting by a Substitute Facility Office is only entitled to receive payment under Clause 14 (Taxes) and Clause 15 (Increased Costs) to the same extent as the relevant Designating Lender would have been entitled prior to designating that Substitute Affiliate Lender or the Substitute Facility Office (as applicable), unless those payments arose as a result of circumstances which arose after such designation.

   without prejudice to paragraph (a) above, the Parent may, by delivering an Extension Request not earlier than 60 days and not later than 45 days before the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement, request the extension of the Maturity Date (which may or may not have already been extended by one year pursuant to paragraph (a) above) by either:    

(i)   
 
 an additional period of one year; or    

(ii)   
 
 in  respect of the Lenders who had not previously agreed to the extension of the Maturity Date pursuant to paragraph (a) above only, by an additional period of two years from the original Maturity Date;

 each Extension Request delivered pursuant to paragraph (a) or (b) above must specify whether, as at the date of that Extension Request, a Default is outstanding or, in the Parent s opinion, might result from the extension requested in that Extension Request;    

(d)   
 
 the Facility Agent must promptly notify the Lenders of the receipt of an Extension Request;    

(e)   
 
   each Lender (in its absolute discretion) is free to decide whether or not to agree to each Extension Request under (a) or (b) above and the Maturity Date shall be extended in respect only of those Lenders which have so agreed;    

 24 

(f)   
 
          each Lender that agrees to an Extension Request by written notice to the Facility Agent by the date falling 21 days before the anniversary of the date of this Agreement to which the Extension Request relates (the   Relevant Cut-Off Date  ) will extend its Commitments for the period so requested of it and the Maturity Date with respect to that Lender will be extended accordingly upon payment of the fee payable pursuant to paragraph   (a)   of Clause   22.8   (Extension Fee) in respect of that extension.  The Facility Agent may notify the Lenders of that extension;

 the balance of the undrawn Commitments under the relevant Swingline Facility; or    

(iv)

   In the case of a US$ Swingline Loan, the US$ Swingline Agent shall, not later than 11.00 a.m. (New York City time) on the proposed Drawdown Date, notify each US$ Swingline Lender of the details of the requested US$ Swingline Loan and the amount of its participation in the US$ Swingline Loan.    

(b)   
 
   In the case of a SEK Swingline Loan, the SEK Swingline Agent shall not later than 11.00 a.m. (Stockholm time) on the proposed Drawdown Date notify each SEK Swingline Lender of the details of the requested SEK Swingline Loan and the amount of its participation in the SEK Swingline Loan.    

(c)   
 
 Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Swingline Lender shall make its participation in the Swingline Loan available to the Swingline Agent for the relevant Borrower on the relevant Drawdown Date.    

(d)

6.4   
 
 Non-payment of Swingline Loans    

(a)   
 
 If a Swingline Loan is not repaid on its due date, each Lender must pay to the relevant Swingline Agent for the relevant Swingline Lenders an amount calculated as described below.    

(b)   
 
 The amount (if any) required to be paid by a Lender is the proportion of the Swingline Loan not repaid (together with any interest accrued and unpaid on that amount from the Drawdown Date of the Swingline Loan to the date of payment by that Lender) which the Revolving Credit Commitment of that Lender bears to the Total Revolving Credit Commitments, less the amount of its share (or that of a Lender which is its Affiliate), before any adjustment under this Subclause, in the unpaid amount of the Swingline Loan.  If this produces a negative figure for a Lender no amount need be paid by that Lender.    

(c)   
 
   On a payment under this Subclause, the paying Lenders will be subrogated to the rights of the Swingline Lenders which have shared in the payment received.    

(d)   
 
 If and to the extent a paying Lender is not able to rely on its rights under paragraph (c) above, the relevant Borrower will be liable to that paying Lender for a debt equal to the amount that paying Lender has paid under this paragraph and the Borrower's liability to the Swingline Lender under paragraph (c) above will be reduced accordingly.    

(e)   
 
 Any payment under this Subclause does not reduce the obligations in aggregate of any Obligor.    

7.   
 
           Repayment    

(a)   
 
   Subject to paragraph (c) below, the relevant Borrower shall repay each Loan in full, on the last day of its Interest Period, to the Facility Agent or (in the case of a Swingline Loan) to the relevant Swingline Agent for the relevant Lender(s) participating in that Loan.    

 28 

(b)   
 
            Without prejudice to each Borrower's obligation under paragraph   (a) above  :     

(i)   
 
 if one or more Revolving Loans are to be made available to a Borrower:    

(A)   
 
 on the same day that a maturing Revolving Loan is due to be repaid by that Borrower;    

(B)   
 
 in the same currency as the maturing Revolving Loan (unless it arose as a result of the operation of Clause 12.2 (Revocation of currency); and    

(C)   
 
 in whole or in part for the purpose of refinancing the maturing Revolving Loan; and    

(ii)   
 
 the proportion borne by each Lender's participation in the maturing Revolving Loan to the amount of that maturing Revolving Loan is the same as the proportion borne by that Lender's participation in the new Revolving Loans to the aggregate amount of those new Revolving Loans,    

 the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Loans shall be treated as if applied in or towards repayment of the maturing Revolving Loan so that: 

(A)   
 
 if the amount of the maturing Revolving Loan exceeds the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Loans:    

I.   
 
 the relevant Borrower will only be required to pay an amount in cash in the relevant currency equal to that excess; and    

II.   
 
 each Lender's participation (if any) in the new Revolving Loans shall be treated as having been made available and applied by the Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender's participation (if any) in the maturing Revolving Loan and that Lender will not be required to make its participation in the new Loans available in cash; and    

(B)   
 
 if the amount of the maturing Revolving Loan is equal to or less than the aggregate amount of the new Revolving Loans:    

I.   
 
 the relevant Borrower will not be required to make any payment in cash; and    

II.   
 
 each Lender will be required to make its participation in the new Revolving Loans available in cash only to the extent that its participation (if any) in the new Revolving Loans exceeds that Lender's participation (if any) in the maturing Revolving Loan and the remainder of that Lender's participation in the new Revolving Loans shall be treated as having been made available and applied by the Borrower in or towards repayment of that Lender's participation in the maturing Revolving Loan.    

(c)   
 
   At any time when a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, the maturity date of each of the participations of that Lender in the Loans then outstanding will be automatically extended to the last day of the Availability Period and will be treated as separate Loans (the  Separate Loans ) denominated in the currency in which the relevant participations are outstanding.     

(d)   
 
   A Borrower from whom a Separate Loan is outstanding may prepay that Loan by giving five Business Days' prior notice to the Facility Agent. The Facility Agent will forward a copy of a prepayment notice received in accordance with this paragraph (d) to the Defaulting Lender concerned as soon as practicable on receipt.     

 29 

(e)   
 
          Interest in respect of a Separate Loan will accrue for successive Interest Periods selected by the Borrower by the time and date specified by the Facility Agent (acting reasonably) and will be payable by that Borrower to the Defaulting Lender on the last day of each Interest Period of that Loan.     

(f)   
 
 The terms of this Agreement relating to Loans generally shall continue to apply to Separate Loans other than to the extent inconsistent with paragraphs (b) to (e) above, in which case those paragraphs shall prevail in respect of any Separate Loan.    

Subject to the other terms of this Agreement, any amounts repaid under Clause 7.1 (Repayment) may be re-borrowed.

(d)   
 
 Any such cancellation shall reduce the Commitment of each Lender in respect of the relevant Facility  pro rata .    

(e)   
 
 The Obligors' Agent may not cancel the Total Revolving Credit Commitments if it would result in the Total US$ Swingline Commitments and the Total SEK Swingline Commitments exceeding the Total Revolving Credit Commitments.    

8.3   
 
   Additional right of prepayment and cancellation    

 If: 

(a)   
 
 any Lender makes a notification to the Facility Agent under Clause 11.3 (Market disruption);    

(b)   
 
 any sum payable to any Lender by an Obligor is required to be increased under paragraph (c) of Clause 14.2 (Tax gross-up);

        an Obligor becomes obliged to pay any amount in accordance with Clause   16   (Illegality) to any Lender,     

 then, without prejudice to the obligations of the Borrowers under those Clauses, the Obligors' Agent may, whilst the relevant circumstances continue, serve a notice of prepayment and cancellation on that Lender through the Facility Agent.  On the date falling five Business Days after the date of service of the notice: 

(i)   
 
 all the Borrowers shall prepay the participations of that Lender and its Affiliated Lender (if any) in all the Loans; and

 then the Facility Agent may, and shall if so directed by the Majority Lenders, by notice to the Obligors' Agent: 

(A)   
 
 cancel the Total Commitments; and/or    

(B)   
 
 demand that all or part of the Loans, together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued under the Finance Documents, be repaid forthwith, whereupon they shall be repaid forthwith.

 31 

any Lender may, by notice to the Facility Agent (which shall promptly notify the Obligors  Agent):

 Any such notice will take effect in accordance with its terms. 

(c)   
 
       If a change of control occurs, the Parent shall promptly notify the Facility Agent upon becoming aware of that change of control and any Lender shall have the right, within one month (or such longer period as the Parent and the Facility Agent acting on the instructions of all the Lenders may agree) of the Facility Agent receiving notice of the change of control under this paragraph, to require the Facility Agent to reduce, by notification to the Parent (the  Notification of Reduction ), its Commitments under the Facility to zero.  Thirty days following receipt of a Notification of Reduction with respect to a Lender, that Lender's Commitment will be cancelled in full and the Borrowers shall repay that Lender's participations in all Loans together with accrued interest and all other amounts accrued under the Finance Documents in respect of that Lender.

9.4

The Facility Agent shall notify each relevant Party of the duration of each Interest Period promptly after ascertaining its duration. 

(a)

(ii)  

if the Parent's long term unsecured and unsubordinated debt has assigned to it a credit rating by both Rating Agencies and the level of both credit ratings is the same, the relevant Margin shall be the percentage rate per annum shown alongside those credit ratings in the table below;  

(iii)   
 
 if the Parent's long term unsecured and unsubordinated debt has assigned to it a credit rating by both Rating Agencies but the level of both credit ratings is not the same, then:    

(A)   
 
 if the credit ratings are different by only one level, the lower level will apply;    

(B)   
 
 if the credit ratings are different by more than one level, then either:    

I.   
 
 the average credit rating will apply; or    

II.   
 
 if the average credit rating falls between two levels, the higher level will apply,    

 and for the purposes of this clause, the  level  of a credit rating shall be that shown as such alongside that credit rating in the table below, with level 1 being the highest and level 4 being the lowest. 

34 

(e)  

(i)  

On and from any date upon which neither Rating Agency continues to assign a credit rating to the Parent's long term unsecured and unsubordinated debt, the Margin shall be 0.55 per cent. per annum.  

(ii)  

The Margin as determined in accordance with subparagraph (e)(i) above shall continue until such time as one or both Rating Agency assigns a credit rating to the long term unsecured and unsubordinated debt of the Parent, at which time the remaining provisions of this Clause 10.2 shall apply.  

(f)   
 
 For so long as:    

(i)   
 
 the Parent is in default of its obligations under this Agreement to notify the Facility Agent of any change in its long-term credit rating in accordance with Clause 19.3 (Information - miscellaneous); or     

(ii)   
 
 an Event of Default is outstanding,     

 the Margin will be the highest applicable rate, being 0.55 per cent. per annum. 

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, accrued interest on each Loan is payable by the relevant Borrower on the last day of the Interest Period for that Loan and also, if the Interest Period is longer than six months, on the dates falling at six monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period. 

(a)   
 
 If an Obligor fails to pay any amount payable by it under the Finance Documents, it shall forthwith on demand by the Facility Agent pay interest on the overdue amount from the due date up to the date of actual payment (both before and after judgment) at a rate (the  default   rate ) determined by the Facility Agent to be one per cent. per annum above, as applicable:    

(i)   
 
 the rate on the overdue amount under Clause 10.1 (Interest rate) immediately before the due date (if of principal of a Loan to the end of the relevant Interest Period current at the due date of payment); or    

(ii)   
 
 if the overdue amount relates to a US$ Swingline Loan, the US$ Swingline Rate; or    

(iii)   
 
 if the overdue amount related to a SEK Swingline Loan, the SEK Swingline Rate; or    

(iv)   
 
 in all other cases (including principal of a Loan following the relevant Interest Period current at the due date of payment), the rate which would have been payable if the overdue amount had, during the period of non-payment, constituted a Revolving Loan in the currency of the overdue amount for such successive Interest Periods of such duration as the Facility Agent may determine (each a  Designated   Interest Period ).    

(b)   
 
 The default rate will be determined:    

(i)   
 
 if calculated by reference to the relevant Swingline Rate, on each day; or    

(ii)   
 
 if calculated by reference to LIBOR, EURIBOR or STIBOR on each Business Day or the first day of, or two Business Days before the first day of, the relevant Designated Interest Period, as appropriate.    

 35 

(c)   
 
        Default interest will be compounded monthly (if calculated by reference to the Swingline Rate) or at the end of each Designated Interest Period (if calculated by reference to LIBOR, EURIBOR or STIBOR).     

10.5   
 
   Notification of rates of interest    

(a)   
 
 The relevant Agent shall promptly notify the Obligors' Agent and the relevant Lenders of the determination of a rate of interest under this Agreement.    

(b)   
 
 The Agent shall promptly notify the relevant Borrower of each Funding Rate relating to a Loan.    

11.   
 
   Changes to the Calculation of Interest    

(a)   
 
  Interpolated Screen Rate : If no Screen Rate is available for LIBOR or, if applicable, EURIBOR or STIBOR for the Interest Period of a Loan, the applicable LIBOR, EURIBOR or STIBOR shall be the Interpolated Screen Rate for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of that Loan.    

(b)   
 
    Reference Bank Rate : If no Screen Rate is available for LIBOR or, if applicable, EURIBOR or STIBOR for:     

(i)   
 
 the currency of a Loan; or    

(ii)   
 
 the Interest Period of a Loan and it is not possible to calculate the Interpolated Screen Rate,    

 the applicable LIBOR, EURIBOR or STIBOR shall be the Reference Bank Rate as of 11.00 a.m. on the applicable Rate Fixing Day for the currency of that Loan and for a period equal in length to the Interest Period of that Loan. 

(c)   
 
  Cost of funds : If paragraph (b) above applies but no Reference Bank Rate is available for the relevant currency or Interest Period there shall be no LIBOR, EURIBOR or STIBOR (as applicable) for that Loan and Clause 11.4 (Cost of funds) shall apply to that Loan for that Interest Period.    

11.2   
 
 Calculation of Reference Bank Rate    

(a)   
 
 Subject to paragraph (b) below, if LIBOR, EURIBOR or STIBOR is to be determined on the basis of a Reference Bank Rate but a Reference Bank or STIBOR Reference Bank (as applicable) does not supply a quotation by 11.30 a.m. on the applicable Rate Fixing Day the Reference Bank Rate shall be calculated on the basis of the quotations of the remaining Reference Banks or STIBOR Reference Banks (as applicable).    

(b)   
 
   If at or about noon on the applicable Rate Fixing Day none or only one of the Reference Banks or STIBOR Reference Bank (as applicable) supplies a quotation, there shall be no Reference Bank Rate for the relevant Interest Period.    

If before close of business in London on the applicable Rate Fixing Day for the relevant Interest Period the Facility Agent receives notifications from a Lender or Lenders (whose participations in a Loan exceed 50 per cent. of that Loan) that the cost to it of funding its participation in that Loan from the wholesale market for the relevant currency would be in excess of LIBOR, EURIBOR or STIBOR (as applicable) then Clause 11.4 (Cost of funds) shall apply to that Loan for the relevant Interest Period. 
 36 

(a)   
 
   If this Clause 11.4 applies, the rate of interest on each Lender's share of the relevant Loan for the relevant Interest Period shall be the percentage rate per annum which is the sum of:    

(i)   
 
 the Margin; and    

(ii)   
 
   the rate notified to the Facility Agent by that Lender as soon as practicable and in any event no later than the date falling five Business Days before the date on which interest is due to be paid in respect of that Interest Period, to be that which expresses as a percentage rate per annum the cost to the relevant Lender of funding its participation in that Loan from whatever source it may reasonably select (such calculation of cost shall be certified in reasonable detail and disclosed to the Obligors  Agent, provided that this shall not in any way require a Lender to reveal any information it considers to be confidential about itself or its operations).    

(b)   
 
   If this Clause 11.4 applies and the Facility Agent or the Obligors  Agent so requires, the Facility Agent and the Obligors  Agent shall enter into negotiations (for a period of not more than 30 days) with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for determining the rate of interest.    

(c)   
 
 Any alternative basis agreed pursuant to paragraph (b) above shall, with the prior consent of all the Lenders and the Obligors  Agent, be binding on all Parties.    

(a)   
 
 Each Borrower shall, within three Business Days of demand by a Finance Party, pay to that Finance Party its Break Costs attributable to all or any part of a Loan or Unpaid Sum being paid by that Borrower on a day other than the last day of an Interest Period for that Loan or Unpaid Sum.    

(b)   
 
 Each Lender shall, as soon as reasonably practicable after a demand by the Agent, provide a certificate confirming the amount of its Break Costs for any Interest Period in which they accrue.    

12.   
 
             Optional Currencies    

(a)   
 
 The Obligors' Agent may select the currency of a Revolving Loan in the relevant Request.    

(b)   
 
 The currency of each Revolving Loan must be US Dollars or an Optional Currency.    

(c)   
 
 The Obligors' Agent may not choose a currency if as a result the Revolving Loans would be denominated at any one time in more than four currencies.    

(d)   
 
 The Facility Agent shall notify each Revolving Credit Lender of the currency of each Revolving Loan, the applicable Facility Agent's Spot Rate of Exchange and the Original Dollar Amount promptly after they are ascertained.    

If before 9.30 a.m. on any Rate Fixing Day, the Facility Agent receives notice from a Revolving Credit Lender that: 

(a)   
 
 it is impracticable for it to fund its participation in a Revolving Loan in the relevant Optional Currency during that Interest Period in the ordinary course of business in the London interbank market (or the European interbank market as appropriate); and/or    

(b)   
 
   the use of the proposed Optional Currency might contravene any law or regulation,    

 37 

the Facility Agent shall give notice to the Obligors' Agent and to the Revolving Credit Lenders to that effect before 11.00 a.m. on that day.  In this event:  

(i)   
 
 the Obligors' Agent and the Revolving Credit Lenders may agree that the drawdown will not be made; or    

(ii)   
 
 in the absence of agreement:    

(A)   
 
 that Lender's participation in the Loan (or, if more than one Lender is similarly affected, those Lenders' participations in the Loan) shall be treated as a separate Loan denominated in US Dollars during the relevant Interest Period;    

(B)   
 
 LIBOR shall be determined pursuant to Clause 11.1 (Unavailability of Screen Rate) save that, for the purposes of such determination, all references in Clause 11.1 (Unavailability of Screen Rate) and in the definition of Interpolated Screen Rate to  11.00 a.m.  shall be deemed to read  1.00 p.m. .    

(a)   
 
 If a Revolving Loan is to be drawn down in an Optional Currency, the amount of each Lender's participation in that Revolving Loan will be determined by converting into that Optional Currency that Lender's participation in the Original Dollar Amount of that Revolving Loan on the basis of the Facility Agent's Spot Rate of Exchange one Business Day before the Rate Fixing Day applicable to that Loan.    

(b)   
 
 The Facility Agent shall notify the Lenders and the Obligors' Agent of Optional Currency amounts (and the applicable Facility Agent's Spot Rate of Exchange) promptly after they are ascertained.    

All payments by an Obligor or a Lender under the Finance Documents shall be made to the Facility Agent or (if the payment relates to a Swingline Facility) the relevant Swingline Agent to its account at such office or bank in the principal financial centre of the country of the relevant currency (or, in the case of Euros, in the principal financial centre of a Participating Member State, Stockholm or London) as it may notify to that Obligor or that Lender for this purpose.  Notwithstanding the above, all payments by the Parent to the Co-ordinators under Clauses 22 (Fees) and 23 (Expenses) shall be made to the Co-ordinators in the manner agreed by the Co-ordinators and the Parent. 

Payments under the Finance Documents to an Agent shall be made for value on the due date at such times and in such funds as the relevant Agent may specify as being customary at the time for the settlement of transactions in the relevant currency in the place for payment. 

(a)   
 
 Each payment received by an Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party shall, subject to paragraphs (b) to (e) below, be made available by that Agent to that Party by payment (on the date and in the currency and funds of receipt) to its account with such office or bank in the principal financial centre of the country of the relevant currency (or, in the case of Euros, in the principal financial centre of a Participating Member State, Stockholm or London) as it may notify to that Agent for this purpose by not less than five Business Days' prior notice.    

 38 

(b)   
 
          Each Agent may apply any amount received by it for an Obligor in or towards payment (on the date and in the currency and funds of receipt) of any amount due from an Obligor under the Finance Documents or in or towards the purchase of any amount of any currency to be so applied.     

(c)   
 
 Where a sum is to be paid to an Agent under the Finance Documents for another Party, that Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that other Party (or to enter into or perform any related exchange contract) until it has been able to establish to its satisfaction that it has actually received that sum.      

(d)   
 
 Unless paragraph (e) below applies, if an Agent pays an amount to another Party and it proves to be the case that that Agent had not actually received that amount, then the Party to whom that amount (or the proceeds of any related exchange contract) was paid by that Agent shall on demand refund the same to that Agent together with interest on that amount from the date of payment to the date of receipt by that Agent, calculated by that Agent to reflect its cost of funds.    

(e)   
 
   If an Agent has notified the Lenders that it is willing to make available amounts for the account of a Borrower before receiving funds from the Lenders then if and to the extent that that Agent does so but it proves to be the case that it does not then receive funds from a Lender in respect of a sum which it paid to a Borrower:    

(i)   
 
 that Agent shall notify the Parent of that Lender's identity and the Borrower to whom that sum was made available shall on demand refund it to that Agent; and    

(ii)   
 
 the Lender by whom those funds should have been made available or, if that Lender fails to do so, the Borrower to whom that sum was made available, shall on demand pay to that Agent the amount (as certified by that Agent) which will indemnify that Agent against any funding cost incurred by it as a result of paying out that sum before receiving those funds from that Lender.    

(a)   
 
 A repayment or prepayment of a Loan or any part of a Loan is payable in the currency in which the Loan is denominated on its due date.    

(b)   
 
 Interest is payable in the currency in which the relevant amount in respect of which it is payable is denominated.    

(c)   
 
 Amounts payable in respect of costs, expenses and taxes and the like are payable in the currency in which they are incurred.    

(d)   
 
 Any other amount payable under the Finance Documents is, except as otherwise provided in the Finance Documents, payable in US Dollars.    

All payments made by an Obligor under the Finance Documents shall be made without set-off or counterclaim. 

(a)   
 
 If a payment under the Finance Documents is due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date for that payment shall instead be the next Business Day in the same calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).    

(b)   
 
 During any extension of the due date for payment of any principal under this Agreement interest is payable on that principal at the rate payable on the original due date.    

 39 

(a)   
 
 If, at any time, an Agent becomes an Impaired Agent, an Obligor or a Lender which is required to make a payment under the Finance Documents to the Agent in accordance with Clause 13.1 (Place) and Clause 13.2 (Funds) may instead either pay that amount direct to the required recipient or, if it is not reasonably practicable to pay that amount direct, pay that amount to an interest-bearing account held with an Acceptable Bank and in relation to which no Insolvency Event has occurred and is continuing, in the name of the Obligor or the Lender making the payment (the  Paying Party ) and designated as a trust account for the benefit of the Party or Parties beneficially entitled to that payment under the Finance Documents (the  Recipient Party ).  In each case such payments must be made on the due date for payment under the Finance Documents.    

(b)   
 
 All interest accrued on the amount standing to the credit of the trust account shall be for the benefit of the Recipient Party or Recipient Parties pro rata to their respective entitlements.    

(c)   
 
 A Party which has made a payment in accordance with this Clause  13.7 shall be discharged of the relevant payment obligation under the Finance Documents and shall not take any credit risk with respect to the amounts standing to the credit of the trust account.    

(d)   
 
   Promptly upon the appointment of a successor Agent in accordance with Clause 21.12 (Resignation of an Agent), each Paying Party shall give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the amount (together with any accrued interest) to the successor Agent for distribution to the relevant Recipient Party or Recipient Parties in accordance with Clause 13.3 (Distribution).    

(e)   
 
 A Paying Party shall, promptly upon request by a Recipient Party and to the extent:    

(i)   
 
 that it has not given an instruction pursuant to paragraph (d) above; and    

(ii)   
 
 that it has been provided with the necessary information by that Recipient Party,    

 give all requisite instructions to the bank with whom the trust account is held to transfer the relevant amount (together with any accrued interest) to that Recipient Party. 

(a)   
 
   If the Facility Agent receives a payment insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable by the Borrowers under the Finance Documents, the Facility Agent shall apply that payment towards the obligations of the Borrowers under the Finance Documents in the following order:    

(i)   
 
  first , in or towards payment  pro rata  of any unpaid, fees, costs and expenses of the Agents under the Finance Documents;    

(ii)   
 
    secondly , in or towards payment  pro rata  of any accrued interest due but unpaid under this Agreement;    

(iii)   
 
  thirdly , in or towards payment  pro rata  of any principal due but unpaid under this Agreement; and    

(iv)   
 
    fourthly , in or towards payment  pro rata  of any other sum due but unpaid under the Finance Documents.    

 40 

(b)   
 
          If a Swingline Agent receives a payment insufficient to discharge all the amounts then due and payable by the Borrowers to the relevant Swingline Lenders under this Agreement, the relevant Swingline Agent shall apply that payment towards the obligations of the Borrowers under the Finance Documents in respect of the relevant Swingline Facility in the following order:     

(i)   
 
  first , in or towards payment  pro rata  of any unpaid fees, costs and expenses of the relevant Swingline Agent under the Finance Documents;    

(ii)   
 
    secondly , in or towards payment  pro rata  of any accrued interest on a relevant Swingline Loan due but unpaid under this Agreement; and    

(iii)   
 
    thirdly , in or towards payment  pro rata  of the principal of any relevant Swingline Loan due but unpaid under this Agreement.    

(c)   
 
   The relevant Agent shall, if so directed by all the Lenders in the case of paragraph (a) above or all the relevant Swingline Lenders in the case of paragraph (b) above, vary the order set out in subparagraphs (a)(ii) to (iv) above or (b)(ii) and (iii) above, as appropriate.    

(d)   
 
 Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) above will override any appropriation made by any Borrower.    

If either the Facility Agent determines (in its discretion) that a Disruption Event has occurred or the Facility Agent is notified by the Parent that a Disruption Event has occurred: 

(a)   
 
   the Facility Agent may, and shall if requested to do so by the Parent, consult with the Parent with a view to agreeing with the Parent such changes to the operation or administration of the Facility as the Facility Agent may deem necessary in the circumstances;    

(b)   
 
 the Facility Agent shall not be obliged to consult with the Parent in relation to any changes mentioned in paragraph (a) if, in its opinion, it is not practicable to do so in the circumstances and, in any event, shall have no obligation to agree to such changes;    

(c)   
 
 the Facility Agent may consult with the Finance Parties in relation to any changes mentioned in paragraph (a) but shall not be obliged to do so if, in its opinion, it is not practicable to do so in the circumstances;    

(d)   
 
   any such changes agreed upon by the Facility Agent and the Parent shall (whether or not it is finally determined that a Disruption Event has occurred) be binding upon the Parties as an amendment to (or, as the case may be, waiver of) the terms of the Finance Documents notwithstanding the provisions of Clause  27 (Amendments and Waivers);    

(e)   
 
   the Facility Agent shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses whatsoever (including, without limitation for negligence, gross negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever but not including any claim based on the fraud of the Facility Agent) arising as a result of its taking, or failing to take, any actions pursuant to or in connection with this Clause  13.9; and    

(f)   
 
 the Facility Agent shall notify the Finance Parties of all changes agreed pursuant to paragraph (d) above.    

 41 

(a)   
 
 In this Agreement:    

 Protected Party  means a Finance Party which is or will be subject to any liability, or required to make any payment, for or on account of Tax in relation to a sum received or receivable (or any sum deemed for the purposes of Tax to be received or receivable) under a Finance Document.

(b)   
 
   The Parent shall promptly upon becoming aware that an Obligor must make a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction) notify the relevant Agent accordingly.  Similarly, a Lender shall notify the relevant Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender.  If an Agent receives such notification from a Relevant Finance Party it shall notify the Parent and that Obligor.    

(c)   
 
     If a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by an Obligor, the amount of the payment due from that Obligor shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax Deduction had been required.     

(d)   
 
 If an Obligor is required to make a Tax Deduction, that Obligor shall make that Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law.    

(e)   
 
 Within 30 days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction, the Obligor making that Tax Deduction shall deliver to the Agent for the Finance Party entitled to the payment evidence reasonably satisfactory to that Finance Party that the Tax Deduction has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing authority.

     The Parent shall (within three Business Days of demand by the relevant Agent) pay to a Protected Party an amount equal to the loss, liability or cost which that Protected Party determines will be or has been (directly or indirectly) suffered for or on account of Tax by that Protected Party in respect of a Finance Document.    

(b)   
 
     Paragraph (a) above shall not apply:

(B)   
 
   under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Finance Party's Facility Office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction,     

 if that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that Finance Party; or 

(ii)   
 
   to the extent a loss, liability or cost:

14.4   
 
   US Taxation - delivery of forms and statements    

(a)   
 
   Within 31 days after the date of this Agreement, each Lender (which is not a United States person as such term is defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the US Code) shall submit to the Obligors' Agent and the Facility Agent duly completed and signed copies of either:    

(i)   
 
 Form W-8BEN-E (entitling the relevant Lender to a complete exemption from withholding on all amounts to be received by it, including fees, under the Finance Documents); or    

(ii)   
 
 Form W-8ECI (relating to all amounts to be received by the relevant Lender, including fees, under the Finance Documents),

(i)   
 
 reasonably requested by an Obligor or the Facility Agent from that Lender (or New Lender); and or    

(ii)   
 
 required under then current United States law or regulations to determine the United States withholding taxes on payment in respect of all amounts to be received by that Lender (or New Lender), including fees, under the Finance Documents.    

(d)   
 
 Upon the request of an Obligor or the Facility Agent, any New Lender that is a United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the US Code) shall submit to the Obligors' Agent or the Facility Agent (as applicable) duly completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9, establishing that it is such a United States person.    

(e)   
 
 If any Lender (or any New Lender) determines that it is unable to submit any form or certificate that it is obliged to submit pursuant to this Clause 14.4, or that any information or declaration contained in any such form or certificate previously submitted has either ceased or will cease to be true, accurate and complete in all respects, it shall promptly notify the Obligors' Agent and the Facility Agent of such fact.    

If an Obligor makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Finance Party determines that:  

(a)   
 
 a Tax Credit is attributable to an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part, to that Tax Payment or to a Tax Deduction in consequence of which that Tax Payment was required; and    

(b)   
 
 that Finance Party has obtained and utilised that Tax Credit,    

 the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Obligor which that Finance Party determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Obligor. 

(a)   
 
 All amounts expressed to be payable under a Finance Document by any Party to a Finance Party which (in whole or in part) constitute the consideration for any supply for VAT purposes are deemed to be exclusive of any VAT which is chargeable on that supply, and accordingly, subject to paragraph (b) below, if VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document and such Finance Party is required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT, that Party must pay to such Finance Party (in addition to and at the same time as paying any other consideration for such supply) an amount equal to the amount of the VAT (and such Finance Party must promptly provide an appropriate VAT invoice to that Party).    

 44 

(b)   
 
          If VAT is or becomes chargeable on any supply made by any Finance Party (the   Supplier  ) to any other Finance Party (the   Recipient  ) under a Finance Document, and any Party other than the Recipient (the   Relevant Party  ) is required by the terms of any Finance Document to pay an amount equal to the consideration for that supply to the Supplier (rather than being required to reimburse or indemnify the Recipient in respect of that consideration):     

(i)   
 
   (where the Supplier is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must also pay to the Supplier (at the same time as paying that amount) an additional amount equal to the amount of the VAT.  The Recipient must (where this paragraph (i) applies) promptly pay to the Relevant Party an amount equal to any credit or repayment the Recipient receives from the relevant tax authority which the Recipient reasonably determines relates to the VAT chargeable on that supply; and    

(ii)   
 
 (where the Recipient is the person required to account to the relevant tax authority for the VAT) the Relevant Party must promptly, following demand from the Recipient, pay to the Recipient an amount equal to the VAT chargeable on that supply but only to the extent that the Recipient reasonably determines that it is not entitled to credit or repayment from the relevant tax authority in respect of that VAT.    

(c)   
 
 Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority.    

(d)   
 
 Any reference in this Clause 14.6 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context otherwise requires) a reference to the representative member of such group at such time (the term representative member to have the same meaning as in the Value Added Tax Act 1994).    

(e)   
 
 In relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any Party under a Finance Document, if reasonably requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly provide such Finance Party with details of that Party's VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party's VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.    

(a)   
 
   Subject to paragraph (c) below, each Party shall, within ten Business Days of a reasonable request by another Party:    

(i)   
 
   confirm to that other Party whether it is:    

(A)   
 
 a FATCA Exempt Party; or    

(B)   
 
 not a FATCA Exempt Party;    

(ii)   
 
   supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party's compliance with FATCA; and    

(iii)   
 
   supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party's compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of information regime.    

 45 

(b)   
 
        If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to paragraph   (a)(i) above   that it is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not, or has ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably promptly.     

(c)   
 
   Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Finance Party to do anything and paragraph (a)(iii) above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of:    

(i)   
 
 any law or regulation;    

(ii)   
 
 any fiduciary duty; or    

(iii)   
 
 any duty of confidentiality.    

(d)   
 
 If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above (including where paragraph (c) above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information.    

(e)   
 
   If a Borrower is a US Tax Obligor or an Agent reasonably believes that its obligations under FATCA or any other applicable law or regulation require it, each Relevant Finance Party shall, within ten Business Days of:     

(i)   
 
 where a Borrower is a US Tax Obligor and the Relevant Finance Party is an Original Lender, the date of this Agreement;     

(ii)   
 
 where a Borrower is a US Tax Obligor on a Transfer Date or a date on which an increase in Commitments takes effect pursuant to Clause 2.9 (Increase) and the Relevant Finance Party is a New Lender or an Increase Lender, the relevant Transfer Date or date on which an increase in Commitments takes effect pursuant to Clause 2.9 (Increase);     

(iii)   
 
 the date a new US Tax Obligor accedes as a Borrower; or    

(iv)   
 
 where a Borrower is not a US Tax Obligor, the date of a request from that Agent,     

 supply to that Agent: 

(A)   
 
 a withholding certificate on Form W-8, Form W-9 or any other relevant form; or    

(B)   
 
 any withholding statement or other document, authorisation or waiver as that Agent may require to certify or establish the status of such Relevant Finance Party under FATCA or that other law or regulation.    

(f)   
 
 An Agent shall provide any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver it receives from a Relevant Finance Party pursuant to paragraph (e) above to the relevant Borrower.     

(g)   
 
   If any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver provided to an Agent by a Relevant Finance Party pursuant to paragraph (e) above is or becomes materially inaccurate or incomplete, that Relevant Finance Party shall promptly update it and provide such updated withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver to that Agent unless it is unlawful for that Relevant Finance Party to do so (in which case that Relevant Finance Party shall promptly notify that Agent). The relevant Agent shall provide any such updated withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver to the relevant Borrower.     

 46 

(h)   
 
        An Agent may rely on any withholding certificate, withholding statement, document, authorisation or waiver it receives from a Relevant Finance Party pursuant to paragraph   (e)   or   (g) above   without further verification.  No Agent shall be liable for any action taken by it under or in connection with paragraphs   (e)   to   (g) above  .      

(a)   
 
 Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction.    

(b)   
 
 Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA Deduction), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall notify the Parent and the Facility Agent and the Facility Agent shall notify the other Finance Parties.    

(a)   
 
   Subject to Clause 15.2 (Exceptions), the Parent shall forthwith on demand by a Finance Party pay to that Finance Party the amount of any increased cost incurred by it or any of its Affiliates as a result of:    

(i)   
 
 any Change in Law; or    

(ii)   
 
 compliance with any regulation made after the date of this Agreement,    

 (including any law or regulation relating to taxation, change in currency of a country, or reserve asset, special deposit, cash ratio, liquidity or capital adequacy requirements or any other form of banking or monetary control). 

(b)   
 
 In this Agreement  increased   cost  means:    

(i)   
 
 an additional cost incurred by a Finance Party or any of its Affiliates as a result of it having entered into, or performing, maintaining or funding its obligations under, this Agreement;    

(ii)   
 
 that portion of an additional cost incurred by a Finance Party or any of its Affiliates in making, funding or maintaining all or any advances comprised in a class of advances formed by or including that Finance Party's participations in the Loans made or to be made under this Agreement as is attributable to a Finance Party making, funding or maintaining those participations;    

(iii)   
 
 a reduction in any amount payable to a Finance Party or any of its Affiliates or the effective return to a Finance Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or (to the extent that it is attributable to this Agreement) on its capital; or    

(iv)   
 
 the amount of any payment made by a Finance Party or any of its Affiliates, or the amount of any interest or other return foregone by a Finance Party or any of its Affiliates, calculated by reference to any amount received or receivable by that Finance Party or any of its Affiliates from any other Party under this Agreement.    

(c)   
 
 As soon as practicable after becoming aware that the Parent is liable, or will become liable, to pay any amount in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) above, the Facility Agent will notify the Parent accordingly.    

 47 

Clause 15.1 (Increased costs) does not apply to any increased cost: 

(a)   
 
 compensated for by the operation of Clause 14 (Taxes);    

(b)   
 
 attributed to any change in the rate of, or change in the basis of calculating, tax on the overall net income of a Lender (or the overall net income of a division or branch of that Lender) imposed in the jurisdiction in which its principal office for the time being is situate;     

(c)   
 
 attributable to the implementation or application of, or compliance with Basel II or any law or regulation that implements or applies Basel II (but excluding any amendment that arises out of Basel III); or    

(d)   
 
 attributable to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a Party.    

(a)   
 
 A Finance Party intending to make a claim for an Increased Cost must provide the Parent with a certificate confirming the amount of (and the calculation leading to such amount, provided that this shall not in any way require a Finance Party to reveal any information it considers to be confidential about itself or its operations), and the events giving rise to, the claim.    

(b)   
 
 Failure or delay on the part of any Finance Party to demand compensation pursuant to this Clause shall not constitute a waiver of such Finance Party s right to demand such compensation; provided that the Parent shall not be required to compensate a Finance Party pursuant to this Clause for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six months prior to the date that such Finance Party notifies the Parent of such Finance Party s intention to claim compensation therefor.    

If it is or becomes unlawful in any jurisdiction for a Lender to give effect to any of its obligations as contemplated by this Agreement or to fund or maintain its participation in any Loan or it becomes unlawful for any Affiliate of a Lender for that Lender to do so, then: 

(a)   
 
 that Lender may notify the Obligors' Agent through the Facility Agent accordingly; and    

(b)  

(i)  

each Borrower shall forthwith prepay the participations of that Lender and its Affiliated Lender (if any) in all the Loans made to it; and  

(ii)  

the Commitments of that Lender and its Affiliated Lender (if any) shall forthwith be cancelled.  

Each Guarantor irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally: 

(a)   
 
 as principal obligor guarantees to each Finance Party prompt performance by each Borrower of all its obligations under the Finance Documents;    

(b)   
 
 undertakes with each Finance Party that whenever a Borrower does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, that Guarantor shall forthwith on demand by an Agent pay that amount as if that Guarantor instead of the Borrower were expressed to be the principal obligor; and    

 48 

(c)   
 
        agrees with each Finance Party that if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal, it will, as an independent and primary obligation, indemnify that Finance Party immediately on demand against any cost, loss or liability it incurs as a result of a Borrower not paying any amount which would, but for that unenforceability, invalidity or illegality, have been payable by it under any Finance Document on the date when it would have been due.    The amount payable by a Guarantor under this indemnity will not exceed the amount it would have had to pay under this Clause 17 if the amount claimed had been recoverable on the basis of a guarantee.     

17.2   
 
 Limitations of guarantee by Autoliv ASP, Inc.    

 The obligations of Autoliv ASP, Inc. under this Clause 17 only extend to the obligations of Autoliv Inc. as Borrower under this Agreement. 

This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to the ultimate balance of sums payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part. 

If any discharge, release or arrangement (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is made by a Finance Party in whole or in part on the basis of any payment, security or other disposition which is avoided or must be restored in insolvency, liquidation, administration or otherwise, without limitation, then the liability of each Guarantor under this Clause 17 will continue or be reinstated as if the discharge, release  or arrangement had not occurred. 

The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 17 will not be affected by an act, omission, matter or thing which, but for this Clause, would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 17 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Finance Party) including: 

(a)   
 
 any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person;    

(b)   
 
 the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group;    

(c)   
 
 the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security;    

(d)   
 
 any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person;    

(e)   
 
 any amendment, novation, supplement, extension, restatement (however fundamental and whether or not more onerous) or replacement of any Finance Document or any other document or security including without limitation any change in the purpose of, any extension of or any increase in any facility or the addition of any new facility under any Finance Document or other document or security;    

 49 

(f)   
 
        any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance Document or any other document or security; or     

(g)   
 
 any insolvency or similar proceedings.    

Without prejudice to the generality of Clause 17.5 (Waiver of defences), each Guarantor expressly confirms that it intends that this guarantee shall extend from time to time to any (however fundamental) variation, increase, extension or addition of or to any of the Finance Documents and/or any facility or amount made available under any of the Finance Documents for the purposes of or in connection with any of the following: business acquisitions of any nature; increasing working capital; enabling investor distributions to be made; carrying out restructurings; refinancing existing facilities; refinancing any other indebtedness; making facilities available to new borrowers; any other variation or extension of the purposes for which any such facility or amount might be made available from time to time; and any fees, costs and/or expenses associated with any of the foregoing.  

Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 17.  This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary. 

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) may: 

(a)   
 
 refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any trustee or agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and     

(b)   
 
 hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor's liability under this Clause 17.    

Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Borrowers under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Facility Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by it of its obligations under the Finance Documents or by reason of any amount being payable, or liability arising, under this Clause 17: 

(a)   
 
 to be indemnified by an Obligor;    

(b)   
 
 to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor's obligations under the Finance Documents;     

(c)   
 
 to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Finance Documents by any Finance Party;    

 50 

(d)   
 
        to bring legal or other proceedings for an order requiring any Obligor to make any payment, or perform any obligation, in respect of which any Guarantor has given a guarantee, undertaking or indemnity under Clause 18.1 (Guarantee and indemnity);     

(e)   
 
 to exercise any right of set-off against any Obligor; and/or    

(f)   
 
 to claim or prove as a creditor of any Obligor in competition with any Finance Party.    

 If a Guarantor receives any benefit, payment or distribution in relation to any such rights it shall hold that benefit, payment or distribution (to the extent necessary to enable all amounts which may be or become payable to the Finance Parties by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents to be repaid in full) on trust for the Finance Parties and shall promptly pay or transfer the same as the Facility Agent may direct for application in accordance with Clause 13 (Payments). 

17.10   
 
 Release of Guarantors' right of contribution    

 If any Guarantor (a  Retiring Guarantor ) ceases to be a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents for the purpose of any sale or other disposal of that Retiring Guarantor then on the date that Retiring Guarantor ceases to be a Guarantor: 

(a)   
 
 that Retiring Guarantor is released by each other Guarantor from any liability (whether past, present or future and whether actual or contingent) to make a contribution to any other Guarantor arising by reason of the performance by any other Guarantor of its obligations under the Finance Documents; and    

(b)   
 
 each other Guarantor waives any rights it may have by reason of the performance of its obligations under the Finance Documents to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under any Finance Document or of any other security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, any Finance Document where such rights or security are granted by or in relation to the assets of the Retiring Guarantor.    

This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party. 

(a)   
 
 Each Guarantor represents, warrants and agrees that:    

(i)   
 
 it will receive valuable direct and indirect benefits as a result of the transactions financed by the Loans; and    

(ii)   
 
 these benefits will constitute "reasonably equivalent value" and "fair consideration" as those terms are used in the fraudulent transfer laws.    

(b)   
 
 Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the Finance Parties have acted in good faith in connection with the guarantee granted under this Clause 17, and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.    

(c)   
 
 This Clause 17 shall be enforceable against each Guarantor to the maximum extent permitted by the fraudulent transfer laws.    

(d)   
 
 Each Guarantor's liability under this Clause 17 shall be limited so that no obligation of, or transfer by, a Guarantor under this Clause 17 is subject to avoidance and turnover under the fraudulent transfer laws.    

 51 

(e)   
 
        For the purposes of this Clause, "fraudulent transfer laws" means applicable United States bankruptcy and state fraudulent transfer and conveyance statutes and the related case law.     

(a)   
 
 In this Agreement:    

 fraudulent transfer law  means any applicable United States bankruptcy and State fraudulent transfer and conveyance statute and any related case law;  
 US Debtor  means an Obligor that is incorporated or organised under the laws of the United States of America or any State of the United States of America (including the District of Columbia) or that has a place of business or property in the United States of America.   
 US Guarantor  means any Guarantor that is a US Debtor; and  
 terms used in this subclause are to be construed in accordance with the fraudulent transfer laws. 

(b)   
 
 Each US Guarantor acknowledges that:    

(i)   
 
 it will receive valuable direct or indirect benefits as a result of the transactions financed by the Finance Documents;     

(ii)   
 
 those benefits will constitute reasonably equivalent value and fair consideration for the purpose of any fraudulent transfer law; and    

(iii)   
 
 each Finance Party has acted in good faith in connection with the guarantee given by that U.S. Guarantor and the transactions contemplated by the Finance Documents.    

(c)   
 
 Each Finance Party agrees that each US Guarantor's liability under this Clause is limited so that no obligation of, or transfer by, any US Guarantor under this Clause is subject to avoidance and turnover under any fraudulent transfer law.    

(d)   
 
 Each US Guarantor represents and warrants to each Finance Party that:    

(i)   
 
 the aggregate amount of its debts (including its obligations under the Finance Documents) is less than the aggregate value (being the lesser of fair valuation and present fair saleable value) of its assets;    

(ii)   
 
 its capital is not unreasonably small to carry on its business as it is being conducted;    

(iii)   
 
 it has not incurred and does not intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they mature; and    

(iv)   
 
 it has not made a transfer or incurred any obligation under any Finance Document with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any of its present or future creditors.    

(e)   
 
 Each representation and warranty in this subclause:    

(i)   
 
 is made by each US Guarantor on the date of this Agreement; and    

(ii)   
 
 is deemed to be repeated by each US Guarantor on the date of each Request and the first day of each Interest Period; and    

 is, when repeated, applied to the circumstances existing at the time of repetition. 
 52 

18.   
 
                          Representations and Warranties     

18.1   
 
 Representations and warranties    

 Each Obligor makes the representations and warranties set out in this Clause 18 to each Finance Party. 

(a)   
 
 It is a limited liability company, duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation.    

(b)   
 
 Each Material Subsidiary has the power to own its assets and carry on its business as it is being conducted.    

It has the power to enter into and perform, and has taken all necessary action to authorise the entry into, performance and delivery of, the Finance Documents to which it is or will be a party and the transactions contemplated by those Finance Documents. 

Each Finance Document to which it is or will be a party constitutes, or when executed in accordance with its terms will constitute, its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms. 

The entry into and performance by it of, and the transactions contemplated by, the Finance Documents to which it is a party do not and will not: 

(a)   
 
 conflict with any law or regulation or judicial or official order; or    

(b)   
 
 conflict with the constitutional documents of any Obligor; or    

(c)   
 
 conflict with any document which is binding upon any Obligor or any asset of any Obligor in a manner which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect.    

(a)   
 
 No Default is outstanding or might result from the making of any Loan.    

(b)   
 
 No other event is outstanding which constitutes (or with the giving of notice, lapse of time, determination of materiality or the fulfilment of any other applicable condition or any combination of the foregoing, would constitute) a default under any document which is binding on any member of the Group or any asset of any member of the Group to an extent or in a manner which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect.    

 53 

(a)   
 
 All authorisations which would reasonably be considered to be required in connection with the entry into, performance, validity and enforceability of, and the transactions contemplated by, the Finance Documents to which it is a party have been obtained or effected (as appropriate) and are in full force and effect.    

(b)   
 
 All acts, conditions and things required to be done, fulfilled and performed under the laws of the United States of America in order to make the Finance Documents admissible in evidence in the United States of America have been done, fulfilled and performed.    

(a)   
 
 In the case of the Parent, the audited consolidated accounts of the Group most recently delivered to the Facility Agent (which, at the date of this Agreement, are the Original Group Accounts):    

(i)   
 
 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in the USA consistently applied; and    

(ii)   
 
 fairly represent the consolidated financial condition of the Group as at the date to which they were drawn up.    

(b)   
 
 In the case of each Borrower other than the Parent, its audited accounts most recently delivered to the Facility Agent:    

(i)   
 
 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles and practices generally accepted in the jurisdiction of its incorporation consistently applied; and    

(ii)   
 
 fairly represent its financial condition as at the date to which they were drawn up.    

(a)   
 
 Other than as specifically disclosed to the Facility Agent prior to the date of this Agreement, no litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings are current or, to its knowledge, pending or threatened, which are reasonably to be expected to be adversely determined, and which might, if adversely determined, have a material adverse effect.    

(b)   
 
 In respect of any litigation, arbitration or administrative proceedings disclosed to the Facility Agent prior to the date of this Agreement, there has been no development in the conduct of those proceedings which might have a material adverse effect.    

It will not be required to make any deduction or withholding from any payment it may make to any Finance Party under the Finance Documents. 

In any proceedings taken in England and Wales, the United States of America or any other relevant state or jurisdiction, in each case in relation to the Finance Documents, it will not be entitled to claim for itself or any of its assets immunity from suit, execution, attachment or other legal process. 

Its obligations under the Finance Documents will rank at least  pari passu  with the claims of all its other unsecured creditors save those whose claims are preferred solely by any bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation or other similar laws of general application.

(a)

   unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document, exercise or refrain from exercising any right, power, authority or discretion vested in it in accordance with any instructions given to it by:

Each Agent may refrain from acting unless and until it receives any such instructions or clarification that it has requested.    

(c)   
 
 Save in the case of decisions stipulated to be a matter for any other Lender or group of Lenders under the relevant Finance Document and unless a contrary indication appears in a Finance Document, any instructions given to an Agent by the Majority Lenders shall override any conflicting instructions given by any other Parties and will be binding on all Finance Parties.    

(d)   
 
 Each Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions of any Lender or group of Lenders until it has received any indemnification and/or security that it may in its discretion require (which may be greater in extent than that contained in the Finance Documents and which may include payment in advance) for any cost, loss or liability which it may incur in complying with those instructions.    

(e)   
 
 In the absence of instructions, each Agent may act (or refrain from acting) as it considers to be in the best interest of the Lenders.

Each Agent and Co-ordinator may accept deposits from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of banking or other business with any member of the Group. 

(a)   
 
       Each Agent may rely on    

(i)   
 
 any representation, communication, notice or document believed by it to be genuine, correct and appropriately authorised;     

(ii)   
 
   assume that:    

(A)   
 
 any instructions received by it from the Majority Lenders, any Lenders or any group of Lenders are duly given in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents; and    

 70 

(B)   
 
        unless it has received notice of revocation, that those instructions have not been revoked; and     

(iii)   
 
 rely on a certificate from any person:    

(A)   
 
   as to any matter of fact or circumstance which might reasonably be expected to be within the knowledge of that person; or     

(B)   
 
 to the effect that such person approves of any particular dealing, transaction, step, action or thing,    

 as sufficient evidence that that is the case and, in the case of paragraph (A) above, may assume the truth and accuracy of that certificate. 

(b)   
 
   Each Agent may assume (unless it has received notice to the contrary in its capacity as agent) that:    

(i)   
 
   no Default has occurred (unless it has actual knowledge of a Default arising under Clause 20.2 (Non-payment));    

(ii)   
 
   any right, power, authority or discretion vested in any Party or any group of Lenders has not been exercised; and

(e)   
 
   Each Agent may rely on the advice or services of any lawyers, accountants, tax advisers, surveyors or other professional advisers or experts (whether obtained by that Agent or by any other Party) and shall not be liable for any damages, costs or losses to any person, any diminution in value or any liability whatsoever arising as a result of its so relying.

(g)   
 
   Unless a Finance Document expressly provides otherwise each Agent may disclose to any other Party any information it reasonably believes it has received as agent under this Agreement.    

(h)   
 
   Notwithstanding any other provision of any Finance Document to the contrary, no Agent or Co-ordinator is obliged to do or omit to do anything if it would, or might in its reasonable opinion, constitute a breach of any law or regulation or a breach of a fiduciary duty or duty of confidentiality.    

(i)   
 
   Notwithstanding any provision of any Finance Document to the contrary, no Agent is obliged to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of its duties, obligations or responsibilities or the exercise of any right, power, authority or discretion if it has grounds for believing the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against, or security for, such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.    

 71 

21.8   
 
        Responsibility for documentation     

 No Agent or Co-ordinator is responsible to any other Party for: 

(a)   
 
 the adequacy, accuracy or completeness of any information (whether oral or written) supplied by an Agent, a Co-ordinator, an Obligor or any other person in or in connection with any Finance Document or the transactions contemplated in the Finance Documents or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document; or    

(b)   
 
 the legality, validity, effectiveness, adequacy or enforceability of any Finance Document or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with any Finance Document; or    

(c)   
 
 any determination as to whether any information provided or to be provided to any Finance Party is non-public information the use of which may be regulated or prohibited by applicable law or regulation relating to insider dealing or otherwise.    

The Agent shall not be bound to enquire: 

(a)   
 
 whether or not any Default has occurred;    

(b)   
 
 as to the performance, default or any breach by any Party of its obligations under any Finance Document; or

 Without limiting paragraph (b) below (and without prejudice to any other provision of any Finance Document excluding or limiting the liability of that Agent), no Agent will be liable for:    

(i)   
 
   any damages, costs or losses to any person, any diminution in value, or any liability whatsoever arising as a result of taking or not taking any action under or in connection with any Finance Document, unless directly caused by its gross negligence or wilful misconduct;    

(ii)   
 
   exercising, or not exercising, any right, power, authority or discretion given to it by, or in connection with, any Finance Document or any other agreement, arrangement or document entered into, made or executed in anticipation of, under or in connection with, any Finance Document, other than by reason of its gross negligence or wilful misconduct; or    

(iii)   
 
 without prejudice to the generality of paragraphs (i) and (ii) above, any damages, costs or losses to any person, any diminution in value or any liability whatsoever (including, without limitation, for negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever  but not including any claim based on the fraud of that Agent) arising as a result of:    

(A)   
 
 any act, event or circumstance not reasonably within its control; or    

(B)   
 
 the general risks of investment in, or the holding of assets in, any jurisdiction,    

   including (in each case and without limitation) such damages, costs, losses, diminution in value or liability arising as a result of: nationalisation, expropriation or other governmental actions; any regulation, currency restriction, devaluation or fluctuation; market conditions affecting the execution or settlement of transactions or the value of assets (including any Disruption Event); breakdown, failure or malfunction of any third party transport,  
 72 

telecommunications, computer services or systems; natural disasters or acts of God; war, terrorism, insurrection or revolution; or strikes or industrial action.

   No Party (other than that Agent) may take any proceedings against any officer, employee or agent of an Agent in respect of any claim it might have against that Agent or in respect of any act or omission of any kind by that officer, employee or agent in relation to any Finance Document and any officer, employee or agent of an Agent may rely on this subclause and enforce its terms under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999.    

(c)   
 
   No Agent will be liable for any delay (or any related consequences) in crediting an account with an amount required under the Finance Documents to be paid by that Agent if that Agent has taken all necessary steps as soon as reasonably practicable to comply with the regulations or operating procedures of any recognised clearing or settlement system used by that Agent for that purpose.     

(d)   
 
   Nothing in this Agreement shall oblige an Agent or a Co-ordinator to carry out:    

(i)   
 
 any "know your customer" or other checks in relation to any person; or    

(ii)   
 
 any check on the extent to which any transaction contemplated by this Agreement might be unlawful for any Lender,    

 on behalf of any Lender and each Lender confirms to each Agent and each Co-ordinator that it is solely responsible for any such checks it is required to carry out and that it may not rely on any statement in relation to such checks made by any Agent or Co-ordinator. 

(e)   
 
 Without prejudice to any provision of any Finance Document excluding or limiting any Agent's liability, any liability of an Agent arising under or in connection with any Finance Document shall be limited to the amount of actual loss which has been suffered (as determined by reference to the date of default of that Agent or, if later, the date on which the loss arises as a result of such default) but without reference to any special conditions or circumstances known to that Agent at any time which increase the amount of that loss.  In no event shall that Agent be liable for any loss of profits, goodwill, reputation, business opportunity or anticipated saving, or for special, punitive, indirect or consequential damages, whether or not that Agent has been advised of the possibility of such loss or damages.    

(a)   
 
   Without limiting the liability of any Borrower under the Finance Documents, each Revolving Credit Lender shall forthwith on demand indemnify the Facility Agent, and each Swingline Lender shall forthwith on demand indemnify the relevant Swingline Agent, for that Lender's proportion of any liability or loss (including, without limitation, for negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever) incurred by the Facility Agent or the relevant Swingline Agent in any way relating to or arising out of its acting as the Facility Agent or the relevant Swingline Agent, except to the extent that the liability or loss arises directly from the relevant Agent's gross negligence or wilful misconduct (or, in the case of any cost, loss or liability pursuant to Clause 13.9 (Disruption to Payment Systems) notwithstanding the Facility Agent's negligence, gross negligence or any other category of liability whatsoever but not including any claim based on the fraud of the Facility Agent).    

(b)   
 
   A Lender's proportion of the liability or loss set out in paragraph (a) above will be the proportion which the Original Dollar Amount of its participation in the Revolving Loans (if any) bears to the Original Dollar Amount of all the Revolving Loans on the date of the demand or, in the case of a Swingline Lender, the proportion which the participation in the relevant Swingline Loans (if any) bear to all the relevant Swingline Loans outstanding on the date of demand.  However, if there are no such Loans outstanding on the date of demand, then the proportion will be the proportion which its Revolving Credit Commitment or relevant Swingline Commitment bears to the Total Revolving     

 73 

Credit Commitments, the Total US$ Swingline Commitments, or Total SEK Swingline Commitments (as applicable) at the date of demand or, if the Total Revolving Credit Commitments, the Total US$ Swingline Commitments, or Total SEK Swingline Commitments (as applicable) have then been cancelled, bore to the Total Revolving Credit Commitments, the Total US$ Swingline Commitments, or Total SEK Swingline Commitments (as applicable) immediately before being cancelled.     

(a)   
 
   An Agent may resign and appoint one of its Affiliates as successor by giving notice to the Lenders and the Parent.    

(b)   
 
     Alternatively an Agent may resign by giving 30 days' notice to the Lenders and the Parent, in which case the Majority Lenders (after consultation with the Parent) may appoint a successor Agent.    

(c)   
 
       If the Majority Lenders have not appointed a successor Agent in accordance with paragraph (b) above within 20 days after notice of resignation was given, the retiring Agent (after consultation with the Parent) may appoint a successor Agent.    

(d)   
 
   If an Agent wishes to resign because (acting reasonably) it has concluded that it is no longer appropriate for it to remain as agent and that Agent is entitled to appoint a successor Agent under paragraph (c) above, that Agent may (if it concludes (acting reasonably) that it is necessary to do so in order to persuade the proposed successor Agent to become a party to this Agreement) agree with the proposed successor Agent amendments to this Clause 21 and any other term of this Agreement dealing with the rights or obligations of that Agent consistent with then current market practice for the appointment and protection of corporate trustees together with any reasonable amendments to the agency fee payable under this Agreement which are consistent with the successor Agent's normal fee rates and those amendments will bind the Parties.    

(e)   
 
   The retiring Agent shall, at its own cost, make available to the successor Agent such documents and records and provide such assistance as the successor Agent may reasonably request for the purposes of performing its functions as agent under the Finance Documents.  The Parent shall, within three Business Days of demand, reimburse the retiring Agent for the amount of all costs and expenses (including legal fees) properly incurred by it in making available such documents and records and providing such assistance.    

(f)   
 
   An Agent's resignation notice shall only take effect upon the appointment of a successor.  On giving the notification, the successor Agent will succeed to the position of the relevant Agent and the term  Facility Agent  or  Swingline Agent  will mean the successor Agent.    

(g)   
 
   Upon the appointment of a successor, the retiring Agent shall be discharged from any further obligation in respect of the Finance Documents (other than its obligations under paragraph (e) above) but shall remain entitled to the benefit of Clause 25.3 (Indemnity to the Agent) and this Clause 21 (and any agency fees for the account of the retiring Agent shall cease to accrue from (and shall be payable on) that date).  Any successor and each of the other Parties shall have the same rights and obligations amongst themselves as they would have had if such successor had been an original Party.    

(h)   
 
   After consultation with the Parent, the Majority Lenders may, by notice to an Agent, require it to resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above.  In this event, that Agent shall resign in accordance with paragraph (b) above.    

 74 

(i)   
 
        An Agent shall resign in accordance with paragraph   (b) above   (and, to the extent applicable, shall use reasonable endeavours to appoint a successor Agent pursuant to paragraph   (c) above  ) if on or after the date which is three months before the earliest FATCA Application Date relating to any payment to that Agent under the Finance Documents, either:      

(i)   
 
 that Agent fails to respond to a request under Clause 14.7 (FATCA Information) and the Parent or a Relevant Finance Party reasonably believes that that Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;    

(ii)   
 
 the information supplied by that Agent pursuant to Clause 14.7 (FATCA Information) indicates that that Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date; or     

(iii)   
 
 that Agent notifies the Parent and a Relevant Finance Party that that Agent will not be (or will have ceased to be) a FATCA Exempt Party on or after that FATCA Application Date;    

 and (in each case) the Parent or a Relevant Finance Party reasonably believes that a Party will be required to make a FATCA Deduction that would not be required if that Agent were a FATCA Exempt Party, and the Parent or that Relevant Finance Party, by notice to that Agent, requires it to resign. 

(a)   
 
   In acting as agent for the Relevant Finance Parties, each Agent shall be regarded as acting through its agency division which shall be treated as a separate entity from any other of its divisions or departments.    

(b)   
 
   If information is received by another division or department of an Agent, it may be treated as confidential to that division or department and the Agent shall not be deemed to have notice of it.    

(a)   
 
   An Agent may treat the person shown in its records as Lender at the opening of business (in the place of that Agent's principal office as notified to the Finance Parties from time to time) as the Lender acting through its Facility Office:    

(i)   
 
   entitled to or liable for any payment due under any Finance Document on that day; and    

(ii)   
 
   entitled to receive and act upon any notice, request, document or communication or make any decision or determination under any Finance Document made or delivered on that day,    

 unless it has received not less than five Business Days' prior notice from that Lender to the contrary in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

(b)   
 
     Any Lender may by notice to the relevant Agent(s) appoint a person to receive on its behalf all notices, communications, information and documents to be made or despatched to that Lender under the Finance Documents.  Such notice shall contain the address and (where communication by electronic mail or other electronic means is permitted under Clause 35.3 (Electronic communication)) electronic mail address and/or any other information required to enable the transmission of information by that means (and, in each case, the department or officer, if any, for whose attention communication is to be made) and be treated as a notification of a substitute address, electronic mail address (or such other information), department and officer by that Lender for the purposes of Clause 35.2 (Addresses for notices) and paragraph (a)(ii) of Clause 35.3 (Electronic communication) and the Agent shall be entitled to treat such person as the person entitled to receive all such notices, communications, information and documents as though that person were that Lender.    

 75 

Without affecting the responsibility of any Obligor for information supplied by it or on its behalf in connection with any Finance Document, each Lender confirms to each relevant Agent and each Co-ordinator that it has been, and will continue to be, solely responsible for making its own independent appraisal and investigation of all risks arising under or in connection with any Finance Document including but not limited to: 

(a)   
 
   the financial condition, status and nature of each member of the Group;    

(b)

27.3   
 
   Disenfranchisement of Defaulting Lenders    

(a)   
 
   For so long as a Defaulting Lender has any Available Commitment, in ascertaining the Majority Lenders or whether any given percentage (including unanimity) of the Total Commitments has been obtained to approve any request for a consent, waiver, amendment or other vote under the Finance Documents, that Defaulting Lender's Commitments will be reduced by the amount of its undrawn Commitments.    

(b)   
 
 For the purposes of this Clause 27.3, the Facility Agent may assume that the following Lenders are Defaulting Lenders:    

(i)   
 
 any Lender which has notified the Facility Agent that it has become a Defaulting Lender;    

(ii)   
 
 any Lender in relation to which it is aware that any of the events or circumstances referred to in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of the definition of " Defaulting Lender " has occurred,    

 81 

unless it has received notice to the contrary from the Lender concerned (together with any supporting evidence reasonably requested by the Facility Agent) or the Facility Agent is otherwise aware that the Lender has ceased to be a Defaulting Lender.

 its Commitment(s) shall not be included for the purpose of calculating the Total Commitments under the Facility when ascertaining whether any relevant percentage (including unanimity) of Total Commitments has been obtained to approve that request; and    

(b)   
 
 its status as a Lender shall be disregarded for the purpose of ascertaining whether the agreement of any specified group of Lenders has been obtained to approve that request.    

27.5   
 
 Replacement of a Defaulting Lender    

(a)   
 
   The Parent may, at any time a Lender has become and continues to be a Defaulting Lender, by giving not less than ten Business Days' prior written notice to the Facility Agent and such Lender:    

(i)   
 
 replace such Lender by requiring such Lender to (and to the extent permitted by law such Lender shall) transfer pursuant to Clause 28 (Changes to the Parties) all (and not part only) of its rights and obligations under this Agreement; or    

(ii)   
 
 require such Lender to (and to the extent permitted by law such Lender shall) transfer pursuant to Clause   28 (Changes to the Parties) all (and not part only) of the undrawn Commitment of the Lender,    

 to a Lender or other bank or financial institution (a  Replacement Lender ) selected by the Parent, and which (unless the Facility Agent is an Impaired Agent) is acceptable to the Facility Agent (acting reasonably) and which confirms its willingness to assume and does assume all the obligations or all the relevant obligations of the transferring Lender (including the assumption of the transferring Lender's participations or unfunded participations (as the case may be) on the same basis as the transferring Lender) for a purchase price in cash payable at the time of transfer equal to the outstanding principal amount of such Lender's participation in the outstanding utilisations and all accrued interest, broken funding costs (to indemnify that Lender for broken funding) and other amounts payable in relation thereto under the Finance Documents. 

(b)   
 
 Any transfer of rights and obligations of a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Clause shall be subject to the following conditions:    

(i)   
 
 the Parent shall have no right to replace an Agent;    

(ii)   
 
 neither the Facility Agent nor the Defaulting Lender shall have any obligation to the Parent to find a Replacement Lender;    

(iii)   
 
 the transfer must take place no later than ten Business Days after the notice referred to in paragraph (a) above; and    

(iv)   
 
 in no event shall the Defaulting Lender be required to pay or surrender to the Replacement Lender any of the fees received by the Defaulting Lender pursuant to the Finance Documents.    

 82 

27.6   
 
          Waivers and Remedies Cumulative     

 The rights of each Finance Party under the Finance Documents: 

(a)   
 
 may be exercised as often as necessary;    

(b)   
 
 are cumulative and not exclusive of its rights under the general law; and    

(c)   
 
 may be waived only in writing and specifically.    

 Delay in exercising or non-exercise of any such right is not a waiver of that right. 

28.   
 
                                                 Changes to the Parties    

No Obligor may assign, transfer, novate or dispose of any of, or any interest in, its rights and/or obligations under the Finance Documents. 

(a)   
 
   A Lender (the  Existing Lender ) may, subject to paragraph (b) below, at any time assign, transfer or novate any of its Commitments and/or its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement to another bank or financial institution or to a trust, fund or other entity which is regularly engaged in or established for the purpose of making, purchasing or investing in loans, securities or other financial assets (the  New Lender ).    

(b)  

(i)  

A transfer of part of a Commitment must be in a minimum amount of at least US$10,000,000 or its remaining Commitment, if less.  

(ii)  

No transfer by a Lender of its Revolving Credit Commitment may result in its US$ Swingline Commitments, its SEK Swingline Commitments, or the aggregate of its Swingline Commitments or that of its Affiliated Lender exceeding its Revolving Credit Commitment;  

(iii)  

A Lender may only transfer its Swingline Commitment to a New Lender if the New Lender is, or will be, a Revolving Credit Lender or an Affiliate of a Revolving Credit Lender.  

(iv)  

The prior consent of the Parent is required for any such assignment, transfer or novation, unless the New Lender is another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or unless an Event of Default has occurred which is continuing.  However, the prior consent of the Parent must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and will be deemed to have been given if, within ten Business Days of receipt by the Parent of an application for consent, it has not been expressly refused.  

(c)   
 
 The Facility Agent is not obliged to execute a Novation Certificate until it has completed all know your customer requirements to its satisfaction.  The Facility Agent must promptly notify the Existing Lender and the New Lender if there are any such requirements.    

 83 

(d)   
 
        A transfer of obligations will be effective only if either:     

(i)   
 
 the obligations are novated in accordance with Clause 28.3 (Procedure for novations); or    

(ii)   
 
 the New Lender confirms to the Facility Agent and the Obligors' Agent that it undertakes to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as a Lender in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent.  On the transfer becoming effective in this manner the Existing Lender shall be relieved of its obligations under this Agreement to the extent that they are transferred to the New Lender.    

(e)   
 
 Nothing in this Agreement restricts the ability of a Lender to subcontract an obligation if that Lender remains liable under this Agreement for that obligation.    

(f)   
 
 On each occasion an Existing Lender assigns, transfers or novates any of its Commitments, or any of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement the New Lender shall, on the date the assignment, transfer and/or novation takes effect, pay to the Facility Agent for its own account a fee of US$2,500.    

(g)   
 
   An Existing Lender is not responsible to a New Lender for:    

(i)   
 
 the execution, genuineness, validity, enforceability or sufficiency of any Finance Document or any other document;    

(ii)   
 
 the collectability of amounts payable under any Finance Document; or    

(iii)   
 
 the accuracy of any statements (whether written or oral) made in or in connection with any Finance Document.    

(h)   
 
   Each New Lender confirms to the Existing Lender and the other Finance Parties that it:    

(i)   
 
 has made its own independent investigation and assessment of the financial condition and affairs of the Obligors and their related entities in connection with its participation in this Agreement and has not relied exclusively on any information provided to it by the Existing Lender in connection with any Finance Document; and    

(ii)   
 
 will continue to make its own independent appraisal of the creditworthiness of the Obligors and their related entities while any amount is or may be outstanding under this Agreement or any Commitment is in force.    

(i)   
 
   Nothing in any Finance Document obliges an Existing Lender to:    

(i)   
 
 accept a re transfer from a New Lender of any of the Commitments and/or rights and/or obligations assigned, transferred or novated under this Clause 28; or    

(ii)   
 
 support any losses incurred by the New Lender by reason of the non performance by the Obligors of their obligations under the Finance Documents or otherwise.    

(j)   
 
 Any reference in this Agreement to a Lender includes a New Lender but excludes a Lender if no amount is or may be owed to or by it under this Agreement and its Commitment has been cancelled or reduced to nil.    

 84 

(a)   
 
 A novation is effected if:    

(i)   
 
 the Existing Lender and the New Lender deliver to the Facility Agent a duly completed certificate, substantially in the form of Schedule 4 (a  Novation Certificate ); and    

(ii)   
 
 the Facility Agent executes that Novation Certificate.    

(b)   
 
 Each Party (other than the Existing Lender and the New Lender) irrevocably authorises the Facility Agent to execute any duly completed Novation Certificate on its behalf.    

(c)   
 
   To the extent that they are expressed to be the subject of the novation in the Novation Certificate:    

(i)   
 
   the Existing Lender and the other Parties (in this paragraph (c), the  Existing Parties ) will be released from their obligations to each other;    

(ii)   
 
 the New Lender and the Existing Parties will assume obligations towards each other which differ from the obligations discharged pursuant to paragraph (i) above only insofar as they are owed to or assumed by the New Lender instead of the Existing Lender;    

(iii)   
 
   the rights of the Existing Lender against the Existing Parties and vice versa will be cancelled; and    

(iv)   
 
 the New Lender and the Existing Parties will acquire rights against each other which differ from the rights cancelled pursuant to paragraph (iii) above only insofar as they are exercisable by or against the New Lender instead of the Existing Lender,    

 all on the date of execution of the Novation Certificate by the Facility Agent or, if later, the date specified in the Novation Certificate (the  Transfer Date ). 

The Facility Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Obligors, shall maintain at one of its offices a copy of each Novation Certificate delivered to it and a register (the  Register ) for the recordation of the names and addresses of each Lender and the Commitments of and obligations owing to each Lender. Without limitation of any other provision of this Clause 28 (Changes to the Parties), no transfer of an interest in a Loan or Commitment hereunder shall be effective unless and until recorded in the Register.  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error and each Obligor, the Facility Agent and each Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Register as a Lender notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 
 85 

In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this Clause  28, each Lender may without consulting with or obtaining consent from any Obligor, at any time charge, assign or otherwise create Security Interest in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or any of its rights under any Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender by way of any charge, assignment or other Security Interest to secure obligations to a federal reserve or central bank, except that no such charge, assignment or Security Interest shall: 

(a)   
 
 release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Finance Documents or substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or Security Interest for the Lender as a party to any of the Finance Documents; or    

(b)   
 
 require any payments to be made by an Obligor other than or in excess of, or grant to any person any more extensive rights than, those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Finance Documents.    

If the Facility Agent has notified the Lenders that it is able to distribute interest payments on a "pro rata basis" to Existing Lenders and New Lenders then (in respect of any transfer pursuant to Clause 28.3 ( Procedure for novations) the Transfer Date of which, in each case, is after the date of such notification and is not on the last day of an Interest Period): 

(a)   
 
 any interest or fees in respect of the relevant participation which are expressed to accrue by reference to the lapse of time shall continue to accrue in favour of the Existing Lender up to but excluding the Transfer Date ( Accrued Amounts ) and shall become due and payable to the Existing Lender (without further interest accruing on them) on the last day of the current Interest Period (or, if the Interest Period is longer than six months, on the next of the dates which falls at six monthly intervals after the first day of that Interest Period); and    

(b)   
 
 the rights assigned or transferred by the Existing Lender will not include the right to the Accrued Amounts, so that:    

(i)   
 
 when the Accrued Amounts become payable, those Accrued Amounts will be payable to the Existing Lender; and    

(ii)   
 
 the amount payable to the New Lender on that date will be the amount which would, but for the application of this Clause 28.6, have been payable to it on that date, but after deduction of the Accrued Amounts.    

(a)   
 
 The Parent must, by giving not less than ten Business Day's prior notice to the Facility Agent, notify the Facility Agent (which must promptly notify the Lenders) of its intention to request one of its wholly-owned (directly or indirectly) Subsidiaries to become an Additional Borrower.  Any Additional Borrower must be incorporated in a member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.    

(b)   
 
   If the accession of an Additional Borrower requires any Finance Party to carry out know your customer requirements in circumstances where the necessary information is not already available to it, the Parent must promptly on request by any Finance Party supply to that Finance Party any documentation or other evidence which is reasonably requested by that Finance Party (whether for itself, on behalf of any Finance Party or any prospective new Lender) to enable a Finance Party or prospective new Lender to carry out and be satisfied with the results of all applicable know your customer requirements.    

 86 

(c)   
 
          If one of the wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Parent is to become an Additional Borrower, then the Parent must (following consultation with the Facility Agent) deliver to the Facility Agent the relevant documents and evidence listed in   Part 2   of   Schedule 2   (Conditions Precedent Documents), in form and substance satisfactory to the Facility Agent.     

(d)   
 
   The prior consent of all the Lenders is required unless the Additional Borrower is incorporated and has its main centre of interest in a jurisdiction in which an existing Borrower is incorporated.    

(e)   
 
 The relevant Subsidiary will, subject to paragraph (d) above, become an Additional Borrower when the Finance Parties have received all of the documents and evidence referred to in paragraph (b) above, and the Facility Agent notifies the other Finance Parties and the Parent that it has received all of the documents and evidence referred to in paragraph (c) above, in form and substance satisfactory to them.  The Facility Agent must give this notification as soon as reasonably practicable.    

(f)   
 
 Delivery of an Accession Agreement, executed by the relevant Subsidiary and the Parent, to the Facility Agent constitutes confirmation by that Subsidiary and the Parent that the representations set out in Clause 18 (Representations and Warranties) (with the exception of Clause 18.23 (Material adverse change) are then correct, and that no Event of Default or potential Event of Default is continuing or would occur as a result of such Subsidiary becoming an Additional Borrower.    

(a)   
 
 If a Reference Bank (or, if a Reference Bank is not a Lender, the Lender of which it is an Affiliate) ceases to be a Lender, the Facility Agent shall (in consultation with the Borrower and the Lenders) appoint another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender to replace that Reference Bank.    

(b)   
 
 If a STIBOR Reference Bank (or if a STIBOR Reference Bank is not a SEK Swingline Lender, the SEK Swingline Lender of which it is an Affiliate) ceases to be a SEK Swingline Lender, the SEK Swingline Agent shall (in consultation with the Borrower and the Lenders) appoint another SEK Swingline Lender or an Affiliate of a SEK Swingline Lender to replace that STIBOR Reference Bank.    

29.   
 
               Disclosure of Information    

Each Lender shall keep confidential any and all information made available to it by any Obligor pursuant to or in connection with the Finance Documents, other than information: 

(a)   
 
 which at the relevant time is in the public domain; or    

(b)   
 
 which, after such information has been made available to that Lender, becomes generally available to third parties by publication or otherwise through no breach of this Clause 29 by that Lender; or    

(c)   
 
 which was lawfully in the possession of that Lender or its advisers prior to such disclosure (as evidenced by that Lender's written records or the written records of that Lender's advisers) and which was not acquired directly or indirectly from an Obligor; or    

 87 

(d)   
 
          disclosed to any person:     

(i)   
 
 to whom information is required or requested to be disclosed by any court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental, banking, taxation or other regulatory authority or similar body, the rules of any relevant stock exchange or pursuant to any applicable law or regulation;     

(ii)   
 
 to whom information is required to be disclosed in connection with, and for the purposes of, any litigation, arbitration, administrative or other investigations, proceedings or disputes; or    

(e)   
 
   the disclosure of which is made to an Affiliate of that Lender in circumstances where it is that Lender's usual practice to make such disclosure or where such disclosure is required as part of that Lender's management or reporting policies or where such disclosure is in the reasonable opinion of that Lender required to protect its position, or to assist in the recovery of amounts, hereunder; or    

(f)   
 
   the disclosure of which is made to any person with whom it is proposing to enter, or has entered, into any kind of transfer, participation or other agreement in relation to this Agreement; or    

(g)   
 
   the disclosure of which is made by that Lender to its professional advisers; or    

(h)   
 
 which is disclosed to another party to this Agreement in the specific circumstances whereby it is made available to that party,    

 provided that, if a Lender makes such information available to any person in accordance with paragraphs (d), (e), (f) or (g) above, it takes reasonable endeavours to ensure that such party keeps that information confidential to the same extent as set out above. 

29.2

 The Parties acknowledge and agree that each identification number assigned to this Agreement, the Facility and/or one or more Obligors by a numbering service provider and the information associated with each such number may be disclosed to users of its services in accordance with the standard terms and conditions of that numbering service provider.    

(c)

30.   
 
             Confidentiality of Funding Rates and Reference Bank Quotations    

30.1   
 
   Confidentiality and disclosure    

(a)   
 
 Each Agent and each Obligor agree to keep each Funding Rate (and, in the case of each Agent, each Reference Bank Quotation) confidential and not to disclose it to anyone, save to the extent permitted by paragraphs (b), (c) and (d) below.    

(b)   
 
   Each Agent may disclose:    

(i)   
 
   any Funding Rate (but not any Reference Bank Quotation) to the relevant Borrower pursuant to Clause 10.5 (Notification of rates of interest); and    

(ii)   
 
 any Funding Rate or any Reference Bank Quotation to any person appointed by it to provide administration services in respect of one or more of the Finance Documents to the extent necessary to enable such service provider to provide those services if the service provider to whom that information is to be given has entered into a confidentiality agreement substantially in the form of the LMA Master Confidentiality Undertaking for Use With Administration/Settlement Service Providers or such other form of confidentiality undertaking agreed between that Agent and the relevant Lender or Reference Bank, as the case may be.    

(c)   
 
   Each Agent may disclose any Funding Rate or any Reference Bank Quotation, and each Obligor may disclose any Funding Rate, to:    

(i)   
 
     any of its Affiliates and any of its or their officers, directors, employees, professional advisers, auditors, partners and Representatives if any person to whom that Funding Rate or     

 89 

Reference Bank Quotation is to be given pursuant to this paragraph   (i)   is informed in writing of its confidential nature and that it may be price-sensitive information except that there shall be no such requirement to so inform if the recipient is subject to professional obligations to maintain the confidentiality of that Funding Rate or Reference Bank Quotation or is otherwise bound by requirements of confidentiality in relation to it;     

(ii)   
 
   any person to whom information is required or requested to be disclosed by any court of competent jurisdiction or any governmental, banking, taxation or other regulatory authority or similar body, the rules of any relevant stock exchange or pursuant to any applicable law or regulation if the person to whom that Funding Rate or Reference Bank Quotation is to be given is informed in writing of its confidential nature and that it may be price-sensitive information except that there shall be no requirement to so inform if, in the opinion of that Agent or the relevant Obligor, as the case may be, it is not practicable to do so in the circumstances;    

(iii)   
 
 any person to whom information is required to be disclosed in connection with, and for the purposes of, any litigation, arbitration, administrative or other investigations, proceedings or disputes if the person to whom that Funding Rate or Reference Bank Quotation is to be given is informed in writing of its confidential nature and that it may be price-sensitive information except that there shall be no requirement to so inform if, in the opinion of that Agent or the relevant Obligor, as the  case may be, it is not practicable to do so in the circumstances; and    

(iv)   
 
 any person with the consent of the relevant Lender or Reference Bank, as the case may be.    

(d)   
 
   Each Agent's obligations in this Clause 30 relating to Reference Bank Quotations are without prejudice to its obligations to make notifications under  Clause 10.5 (Notification of rates of interest)  provided that  (other than pursuant to paragraph (b)(i) above) that Agent shall not include the details of any individual Reference Bank Quotation as part of any such notification.    

(a)   
 
 Each Agent and each Obligor acknowledge that each Funding Rate (and, in the case of each Agent, each Reference Bank Quotation) is or may be price-sensitive information and that its use may be regulated or prohibited by applicable legislation including securities law relating to insider dealing and market abuse and each Agent and each Obligor undertake not to use any Funding Rate or, in the case of each Agent, any Reference Bank Quotation for any unlawful purpose.    

(b)   
 
 Each Agent and each Obligor agree (to the extent permitted by law and regulation) to inform the relevant Lender or Reference Bank, as the case may be:    

(i)   
 
 of the circumstances of any disclosure made pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii) of Clause 30.1 (Confidentiality and disclosure) except where such disclosure is made to any of the persons referred to in that paragraph during the ordinary course of its supervisory or regulatory function; and    

(ii)   
 
 upon becoming aware that any information has been disclosed in breach of this Clause 30.    

No Event of Default will occur under Clause 20.3 (Breach of other obligations) by reason only of an Obligor's failure to comply with this Clause 30. 
 90 

A Finance Party may set off any matured obligation due from an Obligor under the Finance Documents (to the extent beneficially owned by that Finance Party) against any matured obligation owed by that Finance Party to that Obligor, regardless of the place of payment, booking branch or currency of either obligation.  If the obligations are in different currencies, the Finance Party may convert either obligation at a market rate of exchange in its usual course of business for the purpose of the set-off. 

If any amount owing by an Obligor under the Finance Documents to a Finance Party (the  recovering Finance Party ) is discharged by payment, set off or any other manner other than in accordance with Clause 13 (Payments) (a  recovery ), then: 

(a)   
 
 the recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days, notify details of the recovery to the Facility Agent;    

(b)   
 
 the Facility Agent shall determine whether the recovery is in excess of the amount which the recovering Finance Party would have received had the recovery been received by the Facility Agent and distributed in accordance with Clause 13 (Payments);    

(c)   
 
 subject to Clause 32.3 (Exceptions), the recovering Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the Facility Agent, pay to the Facility Agent an amount (the  redistribution ) equal to the excess;    

(d)   
 
   the Facility Agent shall treat the redistribution as if it were a payment by the relevant Obligor under Clause 13 (Payments) and shall pay the redistribution to the Finance Parties (other than the recovering Finance Party) in accordance with Clause 13.8 (Partial payments); and    

(e)   
 
   after payment of the full redistribution, the recovering Finance Party will be subrogated to the portion of the claims paid under paragraph (d) above and the relevant Obligor will owe the recovering Finance Party a debt which is equal to the redistribution, immediately payable and of the type originally discharged.    

If under Clause 32.1 (Redistribution): 

(a)   
 
 a recovering Finance Party must subsequently return a recovery, or an amount measured by reference to a recovery, to an Obligor; and    

(b)   
 
 the recovering Finance Party has paid a redistribution in relation to that recovery,    

 each Finance Party shall, within three Business Days of demand by the recovering Finance Party through the Facility Agent, reimburse the recovering Finance Party all or the appropriate portion of the redistribution paid to that Finance Party together with interest on the amount to be returned to the recovering Finance Party for a period whilst it held the re-distribution.  Thereupon the subrogation in paragraph (e) of Clause 32.1 (Redistribution) will operate in reverse to the extent of the reimbursement. 
 91 

(a)   
 
 A recovering Finance Party is not obliged to pay a redistribution to the extent that it would not, after the payment, have a valid claim against the Obligor concerned in the amount of the redistribution pursuant to paragraph (e) of Clause 32.1 (Redistribution).    

(b)   
 
 A recovering Finance Party is not obliged to share with any other Finance Party any amount which the recovering Finance Party has received or recovered as a result of taking legal proceedings, if the other Finance Party had an opportunity to participate in those legal proceedings but did not do so and did not take separate legal proceedings.    

If a provision of any Finance Document is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that shall not affect: 

(a)   
 
 the validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision of the Finance Documents; or    

(b)   
 
 the validity or enforceability in other jurisdictions of that or any other provision of the Finance Documents.    

Each Finance Document may be executed in any number of counterparts, and this has the same effect as if the signatures on the counterparts were on a single copy of the Finance Document. 

All notices or other communications under or in connection with this Agreement shall be given in writing and, unless otherwise stated, may be made by letter or, in the case of a Request and information provided by the Parent or the Facility Agent in relation to Clauses 19.2 (Financial information) and 19.3 (Information - miscellaneous) only, by e-mail.  Any such notice will be deemed to be given as follows: 

(a)   
 
 if by letter, when delivered personally or on actual receipt; and    

(b)   
 
 if by e-mail, when actually received in readable form.    

 However, a notice given in accordance with the above but received on a non-working day or after business hours in the place of receipt will only be deemed to be given on the next working day in that place.

 The address of each Party (other than the Obligors and the Agents) for all notices under or in connection with this Agreement is:

 Subject to Clause 35.4 (Communication when an Agent is an Impaired Agent) all notices from or to an Obligor or the Obligors' Agent shall be sent through the relevant Agent.    

(f)   
 
 Promptly upon changing its address, an Agent shall notify the other Parties.    

 94 

(a)   
 
     Any communication to be made between any two Parties under or in connection with the Finance Documents may be made by electronic mail or other electronic means (including, without limitation, by way of posting to a secure website) if those two Parties:    

(i)   
 
   notify each other in writing of their electronic mail address and/or any other information required to enable the transmission of information by that means; and    

(ii)   
 
     notify each other of any change to their address or any other such information supplied by them by not less than five Business Days' notice.

(c)   
 
   Any such electronic communication as specified in paragraph (a) above made between any two Parties will be effective only when actually received (or made available) in readable form and in the case of any electronic communication made by a Party to the Agent only if it is addressed in such a manner as the Agent shall specify for this purpose.    

(d)   
 
   Any electronic communication which becomes effective, in accordance with paragraph (c) above, after 5:00 p.m. in the place in which the Party to whom the relevant communication is sent or made available has its address for the purpose of this Agreement shall be deemed only to become effective on the following day.    

(e)   
 
 Any reference in a Finance Document to a communication being sent or received shall be construed to include that communication being made available in accordance with this Clause 35.3.    

35.4   
 
   Communication when an Agent is an Impaired Agent    

 If an Agent is an Impaired Agent the Parties may, instead of communicating with each other through the Agent, communicate with each other directly and (while the Agent is an Impaired Agent) all the provisions of the Finance Documents which require communications to be made or notices to be given to or by the Agent shall be varied so that communications may be made and notices given to or by the relevant Parties directly.  This provision shall not operate after a replacement Agent has been appointed. 

(a)   
 
 Any notice given under or in connection with any Finance Document shall be in English.    

(b)   
 
 All other documents provided under or in connection with any Finance Document shall be:    

(i)   
 
 in English; or    

(ii)   
 
 if not in English, accompanied by a certified English translation and, in this case, the English translation shall prevail unless the document is a statutory or other official document.    

 95 

(a)   
 
   For the benefit of each Finance Party, each Obligor agrees that the courts of England have jurisdiction to settle any disputes in connection with any Finance Document (including a dispute relating to the existence, validity or termination of any Finance Document or any non-contractual obligation arising out of or in connection with any Finance Document) and accordingly submits to the jurisdiction of the English courts.    

(b)   
 
 Without prejudice to paragraph (a) above and for the benefit of each Finance Party, each Obligor agrees that any New York State court or Federal court sitting in New York City has jurisdiction to settle any disputes in connection with any Finance Document and accordingly submits to the jurisdiction of those courts.    

(c)   
 
 The English and New York courts are the most appropriate and convenient courts to settle any such dispute and each Obligor waives objection to those courts on the grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise in relation to proceedings in connection with any Finance Document.      

Without prejudice to any other mode of service, each Obligor: 

(a)   
 
   irrevocably appoints:    

(i)   
 
 Airbags International Limited, Viking Way, Congleton, Cheshire, CW12 1TT United Kingdom, as agent for service of process in relation to any proceedings before the English courts in connection with any Finance Document; and    

(ii)   
 
 CT Corporation System, 111 Eighth Avenue, 13 Floor, New York, New York 10011, as its agent for service of process in relation to any proceedings before any courts located in the State of New York in connection with any Finance Document;    

(b)   
 
 agrees to maintain agents for service of process in England and in the State of New York until all Commitments have terminated and the Loans and all other amounts payable under the Finance Documents have been finally, irrevocable and indefeasibly repaid in full;    

(c)   
 
 agrees that failure by a process agent to notify the Obligor of the process will not invalidate the proceedings concerned;    

(d)   
 
 consents to the service of process relating to any proceedings by prepaid posting of a copy of the process to its address for the time being applying under Clause 35.2 (Addresses for notices); and    

(e)   
 
 agrees that if the appointment of any person mentioned in paragraph (a) above ceases to be effective, the Obligor shall immediately appoint a further person in England or in the State of New York, as appropriate, to accept service of process on its behalf in England or in the State of New York, as appropriate, and, if the Obligor does not appoint a process agent within 15 days, the Lender is entitled and authorised to appoint a process agent for the Obligor by notice to the Obligor.    

 96 

37.3   
 
        Forum convenience and enforcement abroad     

 Each Obligor: 

(a)   
 
 waives objection to the English and New York State and Federal courts on grounds of inconvenient forum or otherwise as regards proceedings in connection with any Finance Document; and    

(b)   
 
 agrees that a judgment or order of an English or New York State or Federal court in connection with any Finance Document is conclusive and binding on it and may be enforced against it in the courts of any other jurisdiction.    

Nothing in this Clause 37 limits the right of a Finance Party to bring proceedings against an Obligor in connection with any Finance Document: 

(a)   
 
 in any other court of competent jurisdiction; or    

(b)   
 
 concurrently in more than one jurisdiction.    

This Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it are governed by English law. 

The Finance Documents contain the complete agreement between the parties on the matters to which they relate and supersede all prior commitments, agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, on those matters. 

Each Obligor irrevocably and unconditionally: 

(a)   
 
 agrees not to claim any immunity from proceedings brought by a Finance Party against it in relation to a Finance Document and to ensure that no such claim is made on its behalf;    

(b)   
 
 consents generally to the giving of any relief or the issue of any process in connection with those proceedings; and    

(c)   
 
 waives all rights of immunity in respect of it or its assets.    

THE OBLIGORS AND THE FINANCE PARTIES WAIVE ANY RIGHTS THEY MAY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION BASED ON OR ARISING FROM ANY FINANCE DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE FINANCE DOCUMENTS.  IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT. 
 97 

Each Finance Party that is subject to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act hereby notifies each Obligor that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Obligors, which information includes the name and address of the Obligors and other information that will allow such Finance Party to identify the Obligors in accordance with the USA Patriot Act.  Each Obligor agrees that it will provide each Finance Party with such information as it may request in order for such Finance Party to satisfy the requirements of the USA Patriot Act.
