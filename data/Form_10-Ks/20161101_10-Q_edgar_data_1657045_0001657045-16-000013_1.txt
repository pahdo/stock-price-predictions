MAKH GROUP CORP. 
 CONDENSED NOTES TO THE  
 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 FOR THE THREE AND NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015  
 (UNAUDITED) 
   
 NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS 
  Organization and Description of Business  
   
 MAKH GROUP CORP. (the  Company ,  we  or  us ) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on August 13, 2014 ( Inception ) and has adopted a December 31 fiscal year end. The Company intends to provide business-consulting services in China. 
   
 NOTE 2   GOING CONCERN 
   
 The Company has incurred a loss since Inception (August 13, 2014) resulting in an accumulated deficit of $32,409 as of September 30, 2016 and further losses are anticipated in the development of its business.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  Management believes that the Company s capital requirements will depend on many factors including the success of the Company s development efforts and its efforts to raise capital. Management also believes the Company needs to raise additional capital for working capital purposes. There is no assurance that such financing will be available in the future.   The conditions described above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
 The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from directors and, or, the  private placement of common stock.   
   
 NOTE 3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Interim Financial Statements  
 The accompanying unaudited condensed interim financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information, and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements furnished reflect all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results for the interim periods presented. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. These unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2015 and notes thereto contained in the Company s Form S-1 (amendment #1) filed on March 16, 2016. 
   
  Basis of Presentation  
   
 The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company s year -end is December 31. 

6 |  Page  

Recent accounting pronouncements   
 The Company continually assesses any new accounting pronouncements to determine their applicability to the Company. Where it is determined that a new accounting pronouncement affects the Company s financial reporting, the Company undertakes a study to determine the consequence of the change to its financial statements and assures that there are proper controls in place to ascertain that the Company s financials properly reflect the change. The Company currently does not have any recent accounting pronouncements that they are studying and feel may be applicable. 

Earnings Per Share  
 For the nine months periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 there were no potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments issued or outstanding and any such shares would have been excluded from the computation because they would have been anti-dilutive as the Company incurred losses in these years.  

NOTE 4   INCOME TAXES 
   
 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities. 

7 |  Page  

As of September 30, 2016 the Company had net operating loss carry forwards of $32,409 that may be available to reduce future years  taxable income through 2036. However, the Company s ability to use the net operating loss carryovers may be substantially limited or eliminated pursuant to Internal Revenue Code Section 382. Future tax benefits which may arise as a result of these losses have not been recognized in these financial statements, as their realization is determined not likely to occur and accordingly, the Company has recorded a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset relating to these tax loss carry-forwards. 
 The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 740-10-50, formerly FIN 48, and  Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes . The Company had no material unrecognized income tax assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016.  

NOTE 5   PREPAID EXPENSES 
   
 As at September 30, 2016, the Company had $9,167 in prepaid expenses, consisting entirely of prepayment of an annual fee paid to OTC Markets Group.  A prepaid expense is carried on the balance sheet of the Company as a current asset and amortized monthly.  
   
 NOTE 6   COMMON STOCK 
   
 The Company has 75,000,000 shares of common stock authorized with a par value of $ 0.001 per share.  
   
 On November 5, 2015, the Company issued 6,000,000 shares of its common stock to the sole director, at $0.001 per share for total proceeds of $6,000. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 2,620,000 shares of its common stock to 29 shareholders at $0.01 per share for total proceeds of $26,200. 
   
 As at September 30, 2016, 8,620,000 shares of common stock were issued and outstanding. 

NOTE 7  RELATED PARTY ACTIVITY 
   
 In support of the Company s efforts and cash requirements, it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the Company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing. There is no formal written commitment for continued support by shareholders. Amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities. The advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note.   
   
 As of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, the amount outstanding was $1,525 and $9,425 respectively. The loan is non-interest bearing, due upon demand and unsecured. 
   
 The Company s sole shareholder and director donated office space free of charge and will devote approximately 20 hours a week to the Company s operations without payments. The revenue earned during the nine months ended were a result of the director s donated consulting hours to an independent third party. 

NOTE 8- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
   
 Commitments:  
 The Company currently has no long term commitments as of our balance sheet date.  
   
 Contingencies:  
 None as of our balance sheet date. 

NOTE 9  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS 
   
 In accordance with ASC 855-10, the Company has analyzed its operations subsequent to September 30, 2016 to the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
   
 As at September 30, 2016 our current assets were $9,216 compared to $6,076 in current assets at December 31, 2015.  The decrease in cash was due to ongoing increase Company expenses and the increase in prepaid expenses for a prepayment of an annual fee. As at September 30, 2016, our current liabilities were $9,425 compared to $1,525 as of December 31, 2015. 
   
 Stockholder s equity was $4,551 as of December 31, 2015 compared to stockholder s deficit of $209 as of September 30, 2016.  
   
  Cash Flows from Operating Activities  
   
 We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $40,127, consisting of net loss of  $30,960 and increase in prepaid expenses of $9,167.

 Cash flows provided by financing activities during the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were $34,100, consisting of $26,200 from proceeds from issuance of common stock and $7,900 from loans from shareholder. 
   
 PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING 
   
 We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business. 
   
 Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next twelve months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations. 
   
 OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
   
 As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. 
   
 GOING CONCERN 
   
 The independent auditors' report accompanying our December 31, 2015 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared  assuming that we will continue as a going concern,  which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.
